George Mitchell asked to chair all-party Ulster talks 
Former US senator George Mitchell on Thursday was invited to chair the
plenary session of all-party Northern Ireland peace talks that open in
Belfast Monday, Britain and Ireland annouced here Thursday.
Once the opening details are addressed, said a statement, and there are
"clear indications of good intent on the part of all the participants
to work constructively and in good faith," a subcommittee on
paramilitary disarmament will be named, with Mitchell also as chairman.
Canadian General Jean de Chastelain will be asked to chair negotiations
on future relations between Dublin and Northern Ireland, the statement
said.
The accord was announced despite strong objections from the Ulster
unionists that Mitchell was too chummy with the republican side to be
completely impartial in peace talks.
Mitchell won the respect of all sides when he chaired a three-man
international body, which included de Chastelain, that last January put
forth detailed proposals for disarmament.
