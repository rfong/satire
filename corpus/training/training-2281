SIA Encouraged to Maintain Pre-eminent Position in Global Market 
A senior Singapore official has urged the Singapore Airline (SIA) to
maintain its pre-eminent position in the global market by consolidating
into alliance and capitalizing on new technologies.
Singapore Minister of State for Communications and Information
Technology and National Development John Chen made the encouragement at
the Singapore Airlines Staff Union Dinner and Dance Saturday.
He said that cross border collaboration between airlines through
strategic alliances and advances in technologies in the offering of
larger and longer range aircraft and in the area of ticket booking or
in-flight services are major challenges to the airline industry.
"To succeed and thrive in the new competitive age, SIA must be able to
compete with other international airlines in the global market and
offer better and more innovative products at competitive prices," he
said.
The minister of state encouraged SIA to make itself "the world' s best
airline" and praised SIA for its successes in responding to the
challenges by joining airlines alliance, investing in new technologies
and strengthening training of workforce.
According to Chen, SIA has joined the Star Alliance whose network
covers over 800 cities in 130 countries and areas, expanded the airline
and airline-related business such as the purchase of the Virgin
Atlantic and Air New Zealand, invested 500 million Singapore dollars
(about 300 million U.S. dollars) on brand new products and services as
well as on new technology to provide the best possible services to its
customers, ordered state- of-art aircraft and introduced e-ticketing,
self-ticketing, and inflight entertainment.
SIA has enjoyed its reputation as one of the world's top airlines and
clinched the TTG Travel Award for "Best Airline ( Overall)" and "Best
Asian airline" during recent media and trade surveys.
