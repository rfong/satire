IMF Mission to Visit Brazil 
A mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will arrive in
Brazil Thursday to interview chiefs of finance and budget, and will
perform the fourth evaluation of the agreement signed with the country.
The Finance Ministry Wednesday said that Finance Minister Pedro Malan
will meet with representatives from the international organization
Friday and it will be the turn of Budget Minister Martus Tavares
Monday.
The mission from the IMF will stay in Brazil for at least one week.
Tavares will explain the Plurianual Plan of Inversion to the IMF
mission, as well as the proposed budget for the year 2000, which were
both made public by President Fernando Cardoso a few days ago.
According to the latest forecast by the IMF, the Brazilian economy "is
on the right road."
Brazil has agreed with the IMF to reach strict fiscal targets in
exchange for a 41.5 billion U.S. dollar loan package aimed at bailing
Latin America's biggest economy out of the devastating effects of its
30-percent plus currency devaluation in January.
