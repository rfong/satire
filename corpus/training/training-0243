Last-gasp goal puts Parma back on top 
A goal in the dying seconds by Gianfranco Zola put Parma back on top of
the Italian first division on Sunday and ended visiting AS Roma's
unbeaten record.
Zola fired in a low, left-footed drive from outside the box leaving the
Roma goalkeeper Giovanni Cervone no chance. It put Parma two points
clear of Lazio and Juventus.
Both teams suffered early first-half injury setbacks. First Parma's
Colombian striker Faustino Asprilla limped off with a pulled leg muscle
and then Roma, already with several first choice players on the
casulaty list, lost their South American marksman Abel Balbo of
Argentina, also with a leg injury.
Roberto Baggio made sure AC Milan's disastrous season took a turn for
the worse with yet another Serie A defeat.
The reigning Italian and European champions went down 1-0 to Juventus,
World Cup star Baggio scoring one minute before the break.
AC Milan, bundled out of the Italian Cup by Inter Milan in midweek just
hours after an appeal over a two-point Champions League penalty failed,
are now in 11th spot in the league.
Lazio beat Cremonese 1-0 at home, former Juventus player Pierluigi
Casiraghi netting with 13 minutes to go.
Fiorentina won 4-2 at Brescia, but the match was marred when riot
police clashed with rowdy supporters. At least 15 people, many of them
policemen, were injured and three were arrested.
