Netscape earnings top forecasts as sales surge 85 percent 
Netscape Communications, the fast-growing Internet software firm, said
Wednesday its fourth quarter 1995 profits surged to 2.4 million
dollars.
The company, which just completed its first full year December 31, said
fourth-quarter revenues were up 85 percent from the prior quarter at
40.6 million dollars.
The quarterly earnings amounted to six cents a share -- triple the
profits for the third quarter and just above Wall Street forecasts.
For the year, the company lost 3.4 million dollars, or nine cents per
share.
Revenues for Netscape's first full year were 80.7 million dollars,
which according to the investment bank Morgan Stanley makes it the
fastest growing software company in its first year.
Netscape, whose stock offering last year drew some two billion dollars
and was one of the hottest on Wall Street, makes the popular software
used to help computer users "browse" the Internet.
While the software has received rave reviews, it is facing increasing
competition, notably from giants like Microsoft Corp.
"Netscape has shown tremendous growth in its first full year of product
shipments, becoming what we believe to be one of the fastest growing
companies in history based on first-year revenues," said Jim Barksdale,
president and chief executive officer at Netscape.
"We are extremely pleased with our first year results and are
continuing to invest aggressively in our business to keep a leadership
position in this rapidly expanding market."
