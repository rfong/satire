Overseas Chinese in Canada Condemn NATO's Atrocities 
Overseas Chinese in Toronto, Canada's biggest city, rallied and
demonstrated Saturday and Sunday, strongly condemning NATO's missile
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade Friday night.
More than 2,000 protesters of overseas Chinese, Chinese Canadians,
Chinese students and Yugoslav Canadians held a protest rally at
Toronto's municipal square Sunday afternoon.
More than 10 representatives spoke at the rally, condemning the attack
on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, which killed three Chinese
journalists and injured more than 20 other persons.
The U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade has
violated the United Nations Charter and international laws, said B. N.
Cham, Chairman of the Confederation of Toronto Chinese and Canadian
organizations.
A Yugoslav Canadian said that NATO's missile attack on the Chinese
embassy was by no means fortuitous. It was because China had firmly
opposed NATO's attacks on Yugoslavia.
On Saturday afternoon, more than 1,000 protesters demonstrated in front
of the U.S. Consulate in Toronto, and then gathered at University
street of the city. A Chinese student representative in a speech at the
rally condemned NATO's barbaric act against the Chinese embassy.
He pointed out that NATO's attacks on Yugoslavia violated the
sovereignty of the Balkan country and urged NATO to stop bombing
Yugoslavia.
The marchers also went to China's Consulate General in Toronto and laid
fresh flowers at its front gate to express their deep mourning to the
Chinese killed in NATO's air strike.
