EU Boosts African Aid 
The European Union said Wednesday it was stepping up food and medical
aid to Angola, launching a dlrs 9 million project to focus on
rebuilding the primary healthcare system.
The EU said its humanitarian office will spend 1 million European
Currency Units (dlrs 1.3 million) a month for the next seven months on
emergency aid for the war-shattered southern African nation.
It also announced a further 4.6 million ecu (dlrs 6.1 million) to keep
an emergency air lift service running into Somalia and southern Sudan
for the next six months.
The EU flights are for transporting aid and aid workers into isolated
areas, and for medical evacuations.
In a statement, the 15-nation EU said up to 2.5 million Angolan's
depend on humanitarian aid.
The EU assistance will be distributed through aid agencies already
working on the ground in Angola, where a peace deal last November
halted 20 years of civil war.
Because Angola's roads are sprinkled with landmines, the EU said much
of the aid would have to be flown to remote areas. (pa)
