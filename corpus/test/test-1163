Xinjiang's Foreign Trade Grows in First Quarter 
The foreign trade volume of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region registered
a 52 percent rise in the first quarter of this year to reach 264
million U.S. dollars.
Its exports increased by 71 percent at 114 million U.S. dollars and
imports totaled 150 million dollars, up 40 percent over last year's
same period.
Both Xinjiang's import and export growth rates were much higher than
the national average in the period, said a local trade official.
As Xinjiang borders with eight countries, the import and export value
of small trade transactions at border areas soared to 159 million U.S.
dollars in the first quarter, 1.3 times the figure of a year ago.
Border trade between Xinjiang and five central Asian countries and
Russia made up half of the region's total foreign trade volume.
Local foreign trade officials predicted the region's exports will
continue to rise in the second quarter.
