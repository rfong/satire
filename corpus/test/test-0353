Malaysia to launch second rating agency 
Malaysia is to launch a second credit rating agency to cope with the
rapid expansion of the country's capital market, central bank officials
said Wednesday.
Malaysian Rating Corp. Bhd. (MARC), established with a paid up capital
of 10 million ringgit (4 million dollars) is to be launched Thursday by
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also finance minister, the
central bank said.
"The shareholders will be made up of 13 stockbroking houses, 14
insurance companies and six discount houses, each holding not more than
4.9 percent equity," a central bank official said.
MARC, temporarily housed at the central bank, will complement the
services provided by Rating Agency Malaysia Bhd. (RAM), set up five
years as the country's first rating agency.
It has appointed Zaiton Hassan, who was general manager of corporate
planning for Malayan Banking Bhd, Malaysia's top bank, to spearhead its
business.
RAM, also capitalised at 10 million ringgit, is owned by 33 commercial
banks, six merchant banks, 10 finance companies and two other financial
institutions.
