India, Pakistan Agree to Release Fishing Boats 
India and Pakistan today agreed to release each other's detained
fishing boats and crew as a "humanitarian" step to promote goodwill
between the two countries, an Indian External Affairs Ministry
spokesman said here today.
The two countries also decided to discuss the reciprocal releases of
other civilian prisoners at a later date.
The above-mentioned agreements were reached during a breakfast meeting
between Indian External Affairs Minister I.K. Gujral and his Pakistan
counterpart Gohar Ayub Khan at Hyderabad House, a state guest house,
this morning.
The two foreign ministers committed themselves to comprehensive
engagements with each other, the spokesman said.
Commenting the breakfast meeting, the spokesman described it as
"useful, productive and constructive."
In its meeting today, the two foreign ministers also agreed to have
another round of talks on the foreign secretary-level early next month
in Islamabad, capital of Pakistan, to discuss all outstanding issues
between the two countries so as to improve their bilateral relations
strained for a long time due to their disputes over Kashmir and other
issues.
Ayub Khan, who was here to attend the 12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
foreign ministers' conference on April 7-8, left here for home after
the breakfast meeting.
