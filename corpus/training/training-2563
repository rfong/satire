In the end, she derailed the Conchita Martinez 'express' 6-3, 6-7 (5/7)
6-3 in a match of vastly changing fortunes.
The 25-year-old German, who has won the French title three times, has
not played Sanchez-Vicario this year, though they shared three
victories a piece in 1994. But overall Graf has won 23 of their 31
meetings.
Graf has lost 39 games -- 13 against Martinez -- and one set on her way
to the final. Sanchez, illness apart, has lost 24 games and is yet to
concede a set.
The rivalry of the two players, like the Martina Navratilova/Chris
Evert duels during the late 70s and 80s, started when former number one
Monica Seles was stabbed on court in Hamburg in April two years ago.
Sanchez, winner in Berlin and Rome this year, is looking forward to the
match: "It will be nice because we both tried to maintain the number
one position for a long time. It has been a lot of competition and it
would be nice to play Steffi again."
As for Graf, she does not underestimate her rival's clay-court ability.
"Arantxa is very consistent. I think she uses the court very well,
doesn't make a lot of mistakes and really fights and runs well," Graf
said.
