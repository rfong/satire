Kohl: Euro Set to Start Punctually 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Friday said the single European currency
will come into being on schedule in 1999 after statistics showed that
Germany, France and Italy will meet the budget deficit requirement for
joining.
"I'm sure that the Euro (single currency) will come punctually on
January 1, 1999. And it will be a stable currency, just like the German
mark over the past 50 years," Kohl said.
His comments came after the German federal statistics office announced
that Germany had a less-than-expected budget deficit of 2.7 percent of
gross domestic product in 1997, well below the 3 percent limit set by
the European Union Maastricht Treaty for the Euro membership.
Meanwhile, France, Italy, and Finland, also announced Friday that their
budgets were also in line with the criteria.
It is now widely expected that around ten or eleven EU member states
will be able to make the first wave to join the Euro in 1999.
However, the final decision on the membership line-up has still to be
made by leaders of the 15 EU members during a special summit on May 2.
