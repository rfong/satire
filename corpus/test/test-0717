US Existing Home Sales Up 6.5 Percent in June 
Existing home Sales in the United States rose 6.5 percent in June as
low mortgage rates continued to lure buyers into the market, The
National Association of Realtors reported today.
The report said sales of existing home totaled 3.78 million units at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate in June, up from 3.55 million units in
May.
It was the second straight monthly advance.
"This is indicative of a steady summer selling season," said Edmund G.
Woods Jr., the association president.
Woods attributed the advance to low mortgage rates that made homes for
affordable at a time of year that is traditionally one of the most
active for home sales.
According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgages averaged 7.53 percent in June, down from 7.91 percent in May
and 9.15 percent in January.
The higher rates earlier this year combined with a slowing economy to
curb the housing industry. As a result, sales of existing homes in June
were 5.7 percent below the same month a year ago.
