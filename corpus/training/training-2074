Islamic states 'aim for mainstream of war on terror' at OIC meet 
A pan-Islamic conference on terrorism here next week is designed to
bring Muslim countries into the mainstream of the fight against
terrorism, the organisers said Wednesday.
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said the special session of
foreign ministers of the 57-nation Organisation of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) would not aim at a specific Islamic approach to the
problem.
"A lot of blame and responsibility has been put on the Islamic people
and Islamic countries, therefore we should be brought into the
mainstream and contribute to the international effort to combat
terrorism," he said.
"We hope we can bring into the mainstream the Islamic view so that we
can overcome the problem of negative perceptions and images that have
been created by the media.
"It is not intended to be a conference for bashing any countries. It is
intended to build confidence, to find solutions, to make
recommendations. "We hope this will be a move that will enable us to
subsequently have an international conference on terrorism.
"We will discuss the root causes, the principles, the solution and also
a plan of action."
Syed Hamid said 48 of the 57 OIC member countries had agreed to attend,
with at least 27 sending their foreign ministers.
Afghanistan, which was suspended from the OIC when the Taliban took
power in 1996, has been invited as Malaysia's guest.
The Taliban was ousted by United States-led forces last year after
terror attacks on New York and Washington blamed on Afghanistan-based
Saudi extremist Osama bin Laden.
The conference will be opened by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, who condemned both the terror attacks on the US and reprisals
against Afghanistan.
Mahathir has repeatedly said Islam has been unjustly singled out as a
source of terrorism, and that the root causes of the phenomenon need to
be examined.
