Serbs regroup war prisoners but no place yet at donors' conference
The Bosnian Serbs took a step Monday to meeting international demands
for the release of their last war prisoners.
Early Monday Serb authorities transferred 18 prisoners -- 12 Croats and
six Moslems -- to a prison here, at the demand of civilian officials
overseeing the Bosnian peace process, a Bosnian Serb official said. The
18 included 16 prisoners the Serbs accuse of war-crimes.
However the move has not yet secured them a place at a major donors'
conference due to start in Brussels on Friday.
On a stopover in Tokyo, Carl Bildt, the civilian High Representative
for Bosnia, said he would decide after his return to Sarajevo on
Tuesday whether the Serbs were complying with conditions to attend the
conference.
Bildt, who has been on a tour of Asian countries to raise interest in
the pledging conference, last week set out a series of demands on
prisoner releases before the event -- aimed at raising 1.2 billion
dollars in aid for Bosnia this year -- could go ahead.
On Saturday he said the Serbs would not be able to attend.
One third of the sum due to be pledged is slated for the Bosnian Serbs.
Moslem-Croat "Federation authorities have complied with their
obligations as regards the release of prisoners of war," Bildt said in
Tokyo.
But he would have to "assess urgently the extent of compliance" by
Bosnian Serbs upon his return to Sarajevo on Tuesday.
In Pale, Dragan Bulajic, head of the Serb commission on prisoner
exchanges, insisted the Serbs were in compliance with Bildt's demands.
Bildt's demands were for all prisoners of war to be released by
midnight last Friday and for the parties to hand over the case files on
war-crimes suspects to UN officials in The Hague, then abide by their
ruling on the cases.
The parties also had to bring the prisoners to one of two central
prisons around Sarajevo and allow 24 hour access to International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and UN police officials.
"We have respected the wilful demands ... to regroup the prisoners
within 30 kilometres (20 miles) of Sarajevo," Bulajic said, saying they
were being kept in a gymnasium because the nearest prison to Pale was
80 kilometres (50 miles) to the east.
However there was still confusion over who the Serbs were holding.
Bildt's office said Sunday that files handed in by the Serbs concerned
13 prisoners registered with the ICRC, together with three prisoners
the ICRC did not know about, and did not detail the cases of three
prisoners of war the ICRC believes the Serbs are still holding.
Bujalic said two Moslem prisoners not among the 16 war-crimes suspects
transfered to Pale on Monday from Banja Luka, would "probably be
released" in Pale. He did not say who they were or when they would be
released.
The head of the local ICRC delegation, Lucie Sternthal and NATO-led
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) officials visited the prisoners after
they arrived in Pale.
