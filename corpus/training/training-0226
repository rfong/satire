Enron demise creates market for trinkets 
The name Enron promises to be forever emblazoned in corporate infamy,
but for now it's a big seller on eBay, the international online
auctioneer.
As of Wednesday, almost 200 Enron-emblazoned goods are flooding onto
the site, which matches buyers and sellers in a gia0FJEyrldwide garage
sale.
The Enron trinkets up for sale include branded yo-yos, golf balls and
even an Enron executive "Code of Ethics" book.
Ahem.
There's also an Enron Swiss Army knife, which can be handy in shredding
those pesky internal documents.
Particularly touching is a crystal trophy, awarded to those who
complete a company course "to teach them character, trust, caring,
leadership and credibility."
