NATO archives show Pope Ratzinger is Jackie Onassis's half brother
NATO HQ - (ReUterus & Ass Mess): Recently recovered NATO archves show
that Pope Joseph Ratzinger's father was Jack "Blackjack" Bouvier,
father of Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis and Caroline Lee Bouvier
Canfield Radziwill.
The documents were salvaged from classified material that the Pentagon
demanded be destroyed in 1988 when George Herbert Bush succeeded Ronnie
Raygun as US President.
Bush was leaned on heavily by the Vatican to obliterate any references
linking the hiring of P2 Lodge thugs to assassinate John F Kennedy in
1963.
And Vatican hitmen were already the top string-pullers in the US
Defense Department to ensure the continued gagging of Holocaust secrets
linking the Bush family to Adolf Hitler.
But unbeknown to Bush Senior the NATO files that got torched on his
insistence were worthless trash.
The battery of blood-tests, brith certificates, verified photographs
and cinematic footage as well as detailed witness testimonies from
Neuremberg war trials - all these were buried under a mountain of
disinformation.
And now other Raztinger-related files have been appended showing the
extent of this quirky family tree.
This identifies today's Pope as the blood-father of Russian President
Vladimir Putain (sic), IRA thug Gerry Adams and the Bush
Administration's very own Asian fall-guy Osama Bin Laden.
"This little set may just explain why Bill Clinton ordered jackie
Kennedy Onassis's personal papers to be locked up for a hundred years
following her death," NATO top brass said today.
"We believe the time may now be right to re-open the mysterious July
1999 plane crash death of John F Kennedy Junior.
"This is the end of the Bushes as we know it!"
