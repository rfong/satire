Senegal unfazed by South Korean necklace furore 
Senegal's preparations for Friday's World Cup opener against France
have not been derailed by the shoplifting allegations levelled at star
midfielder Khalilou Fadiga, a top official said Wednesday.
Malick Sy, president of the Senegal Football Federation, said Fadiga's
involvement in a furore over a stolen necklace had pulled the 'Lions of
Teranga' closer together.
"I don't want to talk about it at the moment," Sy told Senegalese radio
here from Seoul. "For the moment we're just concentrating on the match:
if anything the affair has brought the squad closer together. We're all
behind Khalilou."
Fadiga, who plays for French club Auxerre, was quizzed by police after
allegedly stealing a 300,000 won (240-dollar) necklace from a jewelry
store in the southern city of Daegu.
Allegations levelled at Fadiga have been slammed in Senegal's media,
with several newspapers accusing 'international and French media' of
waging a campaign to destabilise the World Cup debutants.
