ASEAN Urged to Cooperate in Seeking New Tech 
A Malaysian senator Wednesday urged ASEAN countries to enhance
cooperation in the field of expanding knowledge and seeking new
technologies.
Such cooperation would enable the countries in this region to be more
competitive in the economic field and also be able to compete globally,
senator Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahmanhe said in the Senate, Bernama news
agency reported.
The senator proposed that Malaysia forge closer cooperation with India
in the field of computer technology as India is a leader in this field,
saying this would help Malaysia to make a success of its Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC), a 50 by 15 kilometer area specially designed for
hi-tech development.
He was of the view that Malaysia should use Western knowledge as the
basis to upgrade its own technologies.
