Kenya Amasses Troops Along Border With Uganda Kampala
Kenya has amassed a contingent of armed soldiers along its border with
Uganda during the last five days, Uganda's local daily "the New Vision"
reported today.
Deployment of an unknown number of troops started over the weekend but
the motive is not clear, said the report.
It said investigation done among top security organs on both sides of
the Uganda-Kenya border towns of Busia and Malaba indicated that there
are seven positions so far taken by the Kenya troops.
In another development, six people were killed and three others injured
over the weekend in tribal clashes occurred in Uganda's northeast
district of Kotido between Uganda's Karimojong tribal men and Turkana
tribal men from Kenya.
Turkana tribal men, who crossed to Uganda early this year to graze and
water their animals, fled back to Kenya on Sunday with hundreds of
cattle, goats, sheep and food they raided from Kaabong market near
Kotido town, said the report.
