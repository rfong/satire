South Korea Leads Japan in Davis Cup Tennis 
South Korea moved to within one win of defeating host Japan in the
Davis Cup Asia-Oceania zone first round after Lee Hyung-taik and Yoon
Yong-il beat Satoshi Iwabuchi and Thomas Shimada in Kashima, Japan, in
Saturday's doubles.
Lee and Yoon took two close sets on their way to a 7-6 (4), 6-4, 3-6,
6-2 victory at Kashima Sports Center after both countries split
opening-day singles matches Friday.
The South Korean pair came back from 5-3 down to win the first- set
tiebreaker, frustrating Iwabuchi and Shimada with patient stroke play
throughout the match.
