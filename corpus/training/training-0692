Iraq to Restrict U.N. Weapons Inspections 
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tarek Aziz said here today Iraq would not
guarantee U.N. weapons inspectors unrestricted access to all sites they
wish to enter.
Aziz made the defying statement after the West threatened to tighten
sanctions if Iraq fails to cooperate in U.N. weapons inspection.
"I can and will guarantee their access to any sites that is within
their mandate but not beyond their mandate," he told the Cable News
Network (CNN).
"All inspectors should be inspectors, not detectives. If they act like
experts, I have no problems with them. That is why I said our problems
are only with a few of them, those who are actually detectives and not
experts," said Aziz, who is at the U.N. headquarters to attend the
Earth Summit.
The U.N.Security Council says that the experts have the right to enter
any sites in Iraq which they suspect may harbor banned weapons.
But Iraq stresses that the inspectors must have permission to enter
sites which effects national security.
Iraq has barred weapons inspectors from three sites this month. On June
21, the Security Council threatened to impose new sanctions on Iraq.
