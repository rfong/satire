Thaksin Shinawatra Becomes Victim Of Thai Ice Age
Thaksin Shinawatra, the ex-Prime Minister of Thailand, and current
owner of English Premier League football club, Manchester City, flew
into London today, bringing bizarre reports of an Ice Age in his home
country.
Mr Shinawatra is in serious trouble in Thailand, and has had to run
away from the Land of Smiles after his assets there were frozen. In
Thailand, as a general rule, it is so hot, that if anything at all
becomes frozen, it is a serious matter.
Toxin, as he is known, has been accused by a court in Bangkok of
several counts of Abuse Of Power, Concealing Assets, Tax Evasion, Being
Extremely Wealthy, and of Buying A Rubbish Football Club. Rather than
stay and defend his name at a hearing, the ex-PM took flight with his
wife, also a criminal, and fled to the UK.
Authorities in Thailand say that the air temperature has been
unseasonally chilly recently, and the atmosphere surrounding Mr Thaksin
"very frosty".
An official confirmed that the Ice Age had been placed on Thaksin's
estimated 200billion pence of assets.
This morning in Manchester, Sky Blues manager Mark Hughes' sphincter
twitched.
