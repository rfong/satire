Thailand Not to Interfere with Myanmar's Fighting 
Commander-in-Chief of the Thai army Gen. Wimol Wongwanich said Monday
that his country will not interfere with Myanmar's internal affairs and
is not helping drug warlord Khun Sa's troops.
Wimol told reporters, "we insist we will neither get ourselves involved
in the internal matters of Myanmar, nor support any activity against
its government."
Commenting on reports that 20 members of Khun Sa's Muang Tai army had
fled into Thailand and those injured were receiving medical treatment,
Wimol said the arrangement was not intended to help the Muang Tai army,
but done on humanitarian grounds to those who suffer from the ongoing
heavy fighting in Myanmar near the Thai border.
He said those who crossed into Thailand would be disarmed and would be
sent home as soon as the situation returns to normal.
