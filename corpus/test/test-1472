Food in Heaven's Gate mansion shows followers had a sweet tooth 
Members of the Heaven's Gate cult who committed suicide apparently had
a sweet tooth, if the contents of the kitchen of their Rancho Santa Fe
mansion is any indication.
San Diego County officials searching the mansion outside San Diego the
bodies of 39 men and women were discovered March 26 found candy,
cookies and ice cream -- along with 5,400 dollars in cash.
"These weren't people who ate rocks," said county official Susan Jamme.
"That was what impacted me: the normalcy."
Their refrigerator contained everything from frozen pizza to sodas,
authorities said, along with food cult members had purchased in bulk.
Stickers on the pantry shelves identified neatly organized boxes and
cans of food.
Authorities found stickers with cult members' initials on clothes,
shoes and vitamin containers. The members also kept a detailed schedule
showing when sect members had to cut their hair. Male and female cult
members all had the same cropped haircut.
"We considered ourselves as part of an astronaut training program in
preparation to be given membership in a completely separate level of
existence," former sect member Frank Lyford told the San Diego Union
Tribune in a telephone interview from Canada.
Lyford quit the sect in 1993 after being a member for 18 years. He
originally joined the group with friend Erika Ernst, who was among the
cult members who committed suicide.
Authorities said they will eventually auction off the cult household
items, including a gold ring found at the mansion.
