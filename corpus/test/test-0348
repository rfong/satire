Is Syria Next?
Tensions are rising between the U.S. and Syria, which the Bush
Administration has warned against harboring fugitive Saddam loyalists.
What do you think?

"Syria should know better than to help its allies."
Old Man
Fran Whalen,
Attorney
"On the one hand, it'd be foolish to extend a military action that has
already earned us worldwide enmity. On the other hand, it's right
there."
Asian Man
Christopher Tam,
Machinist
"I'd watch out for those Syrians. If we can learn anything from their
past history, it's that those folks are heavily into smiting."
Young Woman
Christina Abel,
Dietitian
"I can think of lots of reasons to attack them, starting with their
vital role in funding Sept. 11. What? Syria? I'm sorry, I thought you
said Saudi Arabia."
Old Woman
Dana Dubrow,
Homemaker
"After Iraq, I think we should hit Syria, then Iran, then Egypt. Or
maybe Iran, then Syria, then Pakistan. Gosh, there are so many ways we
could go here."
Young Man
Rick Swopes,
Forklift Operator
"What possible justification could we have for going to war with Syria?
Oh, I'm just kidding--go right ahead, I don't care."
