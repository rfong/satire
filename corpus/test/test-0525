Sumitomo Metal, Phelps Dodge to boost Chile copper output: report 
Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Ltd., Sumitomo Corp. and Phelps Dodge
Corp. of the United States plan to raise the annual output of a copper
mine in China by around one third, a report said Thursday.
Output at their La Candelaria project is to be increased from late 1998
by 250,000 tonnes of refined copper to 665,000 tonnes, the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun said.
The project is being developed at a cost of 40 billion yen (325 million
dollars), the paper said, adding that the move followed forecasts of a
more than 10 percent increase in world copper demand by 2001.
The Export-Import Bank of Japan and a consortium of Japanese banks are
to lend the project partners 18 billion yen, the leading business daily
said. The balance will be funded by debt.
The joint venture of the three partners, established in 1992, is
producing 415,000 tonnes of copper a year at La Candelaria, according
to the daily.
Of the increased output, 100,000 tonnes is earmarked for the Japanese
market, the Nihon Keizai said.
