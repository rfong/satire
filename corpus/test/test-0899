U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief to Visit Cuba 
President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Thomas Donohue will arrive
here Tuesday for a private visit to Cuba, local press reported Monday.
Donohue, who has been permitted by Bill Clinton's administration to
conduct the visit, is scheduled to meet with Cuban Parliament President
Ricardo Alarcon and several ministers, especially those in charge of
economy.
He will also sign a cooperative accord with Cuba's chamber of commerce
before he winds up his visit.
The U.S. delegation will hold talks with Cuban Public Health Minister
Carlos Dores and visit the Genetic Engineering and Biologic Center of
Carlos J. Finlay Institute.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an association of some three million
business and professional organizations, has repeatedly declared its
rejection of trade bans against other countires, including Cuba.
