Iraq's thieves to have hand chopped off 
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has ordered that thieves have their
right hand chopped off to combat a rise in crime, Iraqi newspapers
reported Sunday.
Frequent offenders would have their left leg cut off from the knee down
and armed robbery would carry the death sentence, under an amendment to
the penal code.
It was the first decree issued by the ruling Revolutionary Command
Council chaired by Saddam since he took over as prime minister on May
29. The decree made no mention of Islamic law, which lays down such
penalties.
Baghdad newspapers have reported a sharp rise in crime since the
crippling UN trade embargo was imposed almost four years ago, after the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
