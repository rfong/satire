Commonwealth Games to Tighten Security Measures 
The security measures will be tightened for the upcoming Commonwealth
Games after a stadium was attacked, the Malaysia Ministry of Youth and
Sports of Malaysia said Saturday.
Last month, vandals damaged the communication system of an indoor
stadium, causing about three million ringgit (about 750,000 U.S.
dollars) in damage.
A bomb disposal unit has also been set up to prevent bomb attacks like
the one at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta two years ago, the Bernama
News Agency reported.
Organizers expect about 6,000 athletes from 68 countries and regions
and some 1,500 journalists for the Games, which open in September.
