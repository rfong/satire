Police arrest Egyptian editor after court sentences him to jail 
Egyptian police arrested the editor-in-chief of the Islamic newspaper
Al-Shaab after a court sentenced him to jail for defaming the son of
Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi, the newspaper said on Tuesday.
"Police arrested Magdi Hussein yesterday (Monday) to implement a court
decision sentencing him to jail ... although the editor-in-chief took
the necessary legal steps to appeal," Al-Shaab said in a statement
received here.
A court on Sunday sentenced Hussein to one year in prison for
publishing a defamatory article in his weekly Al-Shaab last year
accusing Alaa Hassan al-Alfi of "using his father's influence to make
profits by illegal means."
The court said Hussein gave no proof of the allegations.
But Hussein, in statements to AFP, denied that and said he had provided
the court with documents to back up his report.
"The verdict against me is against freedom of the press," Hussein said.
In May, Egypt's court of appeal gave Hussein another 12-month sentence,
suspended for three years, after a similar complaint by the minister's
son.
If the court of appeal confirms Sunday's verdict, the previous sentence
will also become applicable.
