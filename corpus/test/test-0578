Volvo auto sales up 12.7 percent for eight months 
Big Swedish automaker Volvo sold 265,728 cars in the year's first eight
months, up 12.7 percent from 235,645 in the same period last year,
Volvo spokesman Ingmar Hesselfors said on Wednesday.
He said that sales for the period were up by 7 percent in the United
States, 27 percent in Germany and 38 percent in Italy, but they plunged
by 30 percent in France to a mere 4,910 units.
"France has disappeared from the list of Volvo's 10 main markets", the
spokesman said.
