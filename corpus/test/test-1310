North Korea may collapse in six-to-seven months: US official 
North Korea may collapse in six-to-seven months due to a severe food
and energy shortage, a US defense official was quoted as saying by the
Tokyo Shimbun Tuesday.
North Korea "has difficulty maintaining its regime," and the question
is whether it can hold out for "six to seven months," the daily quoted
deputy assistant secretary of defense Kurt Campbell as telling Japanese
lawmakers at a dinner in Washington Monday.
Iwao Matsuda, a lawmaker from Japan's main opposition New Frontier
Party, and other parliamentarians are visiting the United States for a
joint meeting with US counterparts.
Citing the food and energy shortage in the seclusive nation, the US
official said the North Korean society was not functioning properly,
the Tokyo-based newspaper said in a dispatch from Washington.
The nation is already in a critical situation and the problem is no
longer whether North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il can succeed at the top
posts of the nation, Campbell said, warning that an emergency situation
was approaching in the Korean Peninsula.
He noted other countries should not drive North Korea on the wall but
should rather help it to join the international community, the daily
said.
