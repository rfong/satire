Dollar, most European currencies fall against mark 
The leading European currencies and the dollar all lost ground to the
German mark on Monday, with the exception of the Swiss franc which got
a boost from traders' jitters over Communist gains in Russia's
elections.
The pound -- which analysts said was jolted by the government's
publication of higher than expected budget deficit figures -- was down
two pfennigs to 2.1991 marks, as against 2.2193 on Friday.
The government announced budget deficit figures of 3.7 billion pounds
for November, a shock for City analysts who had confidently anticipated
figures of 2.8 billion pounds.
The dollar lost more than a pfennig, down to 1.43 marks against
Friday's closing figure of 1.4425. It also lost ground to the Japanese
currency, down to 101.6 yen as against the previous 102.
The French franc faded after starting the day strongly. It was worth
3.4461 to the mark at the end of the day.
French unions, wielding new power gained in three weeks of strikes, are
about to attack on all fronts but principally wages, working hours and
welfare reforms, in talks on the state of the nation on Thursday.
Striking public transport workers continued to trickle back to their
jobs Monday, but traders are still awaiting a definitive end to the
industrial unrest which has battered the French economy for more than
three weeks.
They were still cautiously awaiting the social summit on Thursday
between the government, trade unions and employers.
The French statistics office said Monday that the strike will hit
growth severely, shaving between 0.3 and 0.4 percent off quarterly
figures for gross domestic product (GDP).
The industrial action will end up costing France between 5.8 and 7.8
billion francs (1.16-1.56 billion dollars) in lost output of goods and
services.
One of the main union leaders warned Monday that the strikes could
resume if a "social summit" later this week fails to deliver on key
demands behind the crisis.
Louis Viannet of the communist-led CGT said the social situation could
go "back up in flames" if Prime Minister Alain Juppe does not make
concrete proposals on a number of areas.
The Swiss franc was the day's success story, rising against the mark
and the dollar. It was trading at 1.1480 to the dollar against 1.1655
on Friday, and at 0.8026 to the mark, against Friday's showing of
0.8052.
Analysts put the Swiss currency's good performance down to uncertainty
in over European monetary union, as the Madrid summit failed to clarify
all the problems associated with the move. Switzerland is not a member
of the EU.
The lira fell to 1,115 to the mark, down from Friday's 1,105 amid
continuing confusion over the Italian budget, according to analysts.
The dollar was trading at 1.43 marks, as against 1.4425 on Friday
night, 101.60 yen against Friday 102, 1.1480 Swiss francs from 1.1655
and 4.9313 francs as against 4.9638.
The mark was fixed at 3.4468 francs from 3.44, 1,115 lire against
1,105, 85.26 pesetas from 85.24, 0.8026 Swiss francs against 0.8052
70.99 yen against 70.70.
Sterling was at 1.5363 against 1.5385, at 2.1991 marks against 2.2193,
156.24 yen against 156.93, 1.7654 Swiss Francs against 1.7931 and
7.5833 francs against 7.6367.
The price of gold continued to rise, to 387.2 dollars an ounce against
386.2.
The three-month Eurodollar rate held steady at 5.6875 percent, while
the three month interbank rate also remained at 6.4375 percent.
