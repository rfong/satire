ARATS Calls for Release of Mainland Fisherman Detained by Taiwan 
The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) today
called for the release of Fang Zhongxiao, a mainland fisherman detained
by Taiwan police under the charge of "illegal border-crossing" on
January 6 this year.
The ARATS made the call in a letter to Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), explaining that Fang, led by a Taiwan fisherman to
meet a fellow townsman working on another Taiwanese boat, had received
approval from Taiwan police.
The letter also calls for apology and compensation for another 18
mainland fishermen who were falsely detained by Taiwan police on
February 25 under the same charge as Fang.
The letter says that those fishermen, led by their new Taiwan
employers, were detained by Taiwan police before reaching their
destination. Police interrogated all the fishermen and tortured some of
them. The fishermen were released on March 3 when it was confirmed that
they all had completed procedures.
The letter asks the SEF to convey all the information to concerned
departments of the Taiwan authorities, and seeks a pledge that similar
incidents will never happen again.
