Get ready for Giuli-Co, America!
By Rudy Giuliani
Major news, everybody. I'm appearing on Larry King tonight. I'll be
discussing all sorts of things. My love of all things Cuban, why the
Devil Rays are infinitely superior to the Yankees, how Orlando is
America's most culturally important city, Judy's love of retirement
homes and just generally about how special Florida and all the
wonderful, sane, intelligent, totally-not-fucked-up-beyond-all-repair
people that live there are.
Oh and I'll also be appearing with my running mate. That's right, I'm
jumping out in front of the entire field and announcing early who will
be my vice-president. It's Cojo! No, not the rabid dog.
Steven Cojocaru, the Entertainment Tonight co-host who looks like a
rabid dog. Yes, we'll both be appearing on Larry King to talk about his
kidney disease, depression and our November run. I'll discuss 9/11 and
Cojo will talk about what he was wearing on 9/11.
The nomination is as good as mine. Now I've got to get ready for
tonight's show. Hey Cojo, does this red sweater go with my loafers?
