Iranian Women Play First-ever Indoor Soccer Championship 
Iranian women are holding their first-ever indoor soccer championship
here, the Tehran Times newspaper reported Monday.
More than 20 teams from Tehran and nearby provinces are playing in the
10-day national championship, with 14 females being referees, the
report said.
The games are held in front of a female-only audience, and no men are
allowed to even enter the Azadi Sports Complex, where the games are
being held.
Iranian women have long struggled for permission to play soccer and
even wanted to establish their own soccer federation and national
league, which have still been rejected.
Soccer is the most popular sport in Iran and the fever has caught
Iranian women.
