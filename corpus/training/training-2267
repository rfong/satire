U.S. Leads in Fastest Supercomputers: Report 
The United States has replaced Japan as the world's number one maker of
fastest supercomputers, the New York Times reported today.
This was shown by the introduction of a prototype supercomputer built
by the Intel Corporation for the Sandia National Laboratory in
Albuquerque, N.M., the paper quoted a report as saying.
The report was issued Friday by computer scientists at the University
of Tennessee.
The latest Intel product is based on 9,152 Intel Pentium P6 processors
and has achieved a peak speed of more than 1.3 trillion mathematical
operations a second, the report said.
Among the world's 20 fastest supercomputers, 16 are made in the United
States, with the rest made by Japanese companies, the report said,
adding that the situation is a shift from last year when Japan was the
maker of not only the three fastest supercomputers, but also ten of the
20 fastest ones.
Silicon Graphic, Sun Microsystems, I.B.M and others were listed as
major U.S. supercomputer manufacturers.
