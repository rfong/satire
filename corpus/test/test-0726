Tanzania contests World Bank recommendation to close oil refinery 
Tanzanian authorities have strongly contested a recommendation by the
World Bank that the country should close down its inefficiently-run
Tanzanian Tiper Oil Refinery and import cheaper oil products from South
Africa.
Speaking during the presentation of a World Bank-financed study on
rationalisation of petroleum supply in Tanzania, officials from the
finance, energy and legal affairs ministries warned that the closure of
the refinery and liberalisation of oil business could lead to "supply
insecurity and jeopardise Tanzania's sovereignty."
The officials also warned that such a move would reduce the state-owned
Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) to a mere monitoring
body.
Presenting the World Bank-financed report, Carlo Piccolo of Italian
firm Cuneo e Associati, which conducted last year's study, said "losses
from the inefficient" refinery and "high mark-ups" by the TPDC had led
to an increased cost to consumers of 100 million dollars a year, later
revised by the report to 73 million.
Piccolo said that the uneconomical operation of the refinery, now in a
dilapidated state, and its use of TPDC to expensively procure its small
supply of oil it refines was the major cause of high prices of its
products and recommended that it should closed and Tanzania procure its
oil products from South Africa, which does not produce oil but also
depends on imported crude.
The World Bank has given the implementation of the recommendations in
the report as a pre-condition for its releasing of the second tranche
of a 200-million-dollar structural adjustment credit.
But the TPDC has contested the way the study arrived at its
100-million-dollar high-cost figure, pointing out that the consultants
did not take into account the actual exchange rate paid by TPDC now and
not 1993 official rate of 395 Tanzanian shilling per dollar used in the
study.
It said that due to delays in announcing new oil prices by the
government in 1992 and 1993, due to currency flactuations, the TPDC
then suffered a loss of 6.6 billion shillings (22 million dollars), as
local sale prices were quoted in local currency.
The TPDC maintains that "given its size and demand for its products,
taking into account social and economic benefits, it believe that its
plant is worth maintaining, because apart from operating profitably, it
was also helping save the country about 18 million dollars foreign
exchange a year through provision of liquified petroleum gas and fuel
oil, which would have been imported.
The refinery has a capacity for 560,000 tonnes of crude, with 360,000
tonnes of white products imported annually to help it meet national
demands.
