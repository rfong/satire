Father of "shoe bomber" suspect wants him hospitalized 
The father of a British man suspected of attempting to blow up a
trans-Atlantic passenger jet with explosives hidden in his shoes said
Monday he believed his son belonged in a mental institution rather than
in jail.
"I hope he is put into an institution where they can help him, like a
hospital or something like that, where they can try to sort his mind
out," said Robin Reid appearing on CNN's "Larry King Live" program.
British national Richard Reid, 28, was charged with intimidation and
interfering with a flight crew last month, after he allegedly tried to
blow up an American Airlines Boeing 767 flying from Paris to Miami on
December 22.
He was overpowered by flight staff and other passengers after
apparently trying to light with a match a fuse attached to explosives
packed into the heel of his shoes.
His father said he was shocked when he learned about the incident from
a newspaper.
He said he was now concerned his son would commit suicide while in
jail.
"I fear for him, yes," said Robin Reid. "I mean, it would be the one
way out for him."
He said be believed the problems experienced by his son, who is
part-British, part-Jamaican, stem, in part, from his mixed racial
heritage.
"We are outcasts by everybody," said Robin Reid. "He'd been rejected by
people."
