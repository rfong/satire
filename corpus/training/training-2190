Over all, the seven regional Bell companies are planning to spend as

video games or interactive programming.
Ovitz and his team have been working on the current deal for nearly two

In recent months, a new executive there, Robert Kavner, formerly chief
of multimedia at AT&AMP;T Corp., has shaped the effort among Bell

New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Reports of the discussions among the three phone companies began
circulating in August, about the same time that Walt Disney Co.
announced a deal with Ameritech, BellSouth and Southwestern Bell --
since renamed SBC Communications -- to develop, market and deliver
programming.
