NATO to Reconsider Candidates in 2002: Cohen 
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen said here Tuesday that NATO
would make a new appraisal of the candidates toward their integration
with the Alliance in the year 2002.
Cohen made the remark soon after the Bucharest meeting of defense
ministers of southeastern Europe. "By then, we will collaborate with
Romania in order to help it attain its goal," Cohen added, explaining
that Romania still had to make important steps on the way to NATO
integration.
Cohen listed the main targets Romania had to attain in view of its
integration with the Alliance: the building up of a market economy, the
achievement of a stable democracy, the implementation of civil control
of the Army and the ability to demonstrate it would provide security in
the region.
The U.S. secretary of defense appreciated Romania's wish and actions
for integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures, emphasizing the
country's efforts on this line, in spite of the difficulties it had to
cope with.
