Japan's Sony says no decision on buy-out of Internet provider 
Japan's Sony Corp. said Friday it had not reached a decision on its
reported 100-billion-yen (756-million-dollar) plan to buy the nation's
biggest Internet service provider from Fujitsu Ltd.
"We are having talks on the possibility of the Internet business, but
nothing has been decided at the moment," Sony said in a statement. "We
are not in the stage of making a comment."
Sony was referring to a report Friday by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun that
the firm aimed to acquire Internet service provider Nifty Corp. from
Fujitsu in a bid to expand its online business for general consumers.
The buy-out is expected to cost about 100 billion yen, the economic
daily said, adding the talks would be concluded by next February.
Sony has its own provider unit, Sony Communication Network Corp.,
better known as So-net, but it ranks sixth in Japan with 1.8 million
subscribers against five million subscribers at Nifty.
The news pushed up the stocks of Sony and Fujitsu on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange Friday morning.
Sony was up 160 yen, or 2.8 percent, at 5,980 yen at 10:25 am (0125
GMT), with Fujitsu gaining 16 yen or 1.7 percent to 970 yen.
