Egypt to tell Israeli president of concern over peace process 
Egypt will tell Israeli President Ezer Weizman of its concern for the
future of the troubled Middle East peace process when the head of state
visits on Monday, Foreign Minister Amr Mussa said Sunday.
"The general unease surrounding the peace process and Israel's position
on the basic principles of this process will be the issues raised by
Egypt," he told reporters.
Egypt's ambassador to Israel, Mohammad Bassiuni, said for his part that
Weizman was anxious to promote good relations with Egypt, the first
Arab country to sign peace with the Jewish state in 1979.
Weizman "works continually to support and develop relations between the
two countries because he believes that Egypt is the main pillar of the
Middle East peace process," Bassiuni said.
The Israeli president's one-day visit to Cairo came at the invitation
of his Egyptian counterpart, Hosni Mubarak.
Since the election in May of Israel's right-wing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, Mubarak has been outspoken in demanding that the
Israeli government speed up implementation of peace agreements signed
with the Palestinians.
Weizman, whose role is largely ceremonial, has taken a higher profile
role in recent days as Arab leaders have voiced hostile criticism of
Netanyahu.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held an unprecedented meeting with him
at the Israeli president's seaside home on Tuesday, while Weizman has
also been invited to Jordan for a meeting with King Hussein.
