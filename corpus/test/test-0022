Moore Satisfied With Qatar's Preparations for WTO Meeting 
Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Michael Moore
has expressed his satisfaction with Qatar's preparations for hosting
next month's WTO ministerial conference, Kuwait's official KUNA news
agency reported on Monday.
Sources of the Qatari organizing committee of the meeting said that
Moore has met with officials of the committee and inspected a number of
utilities and installations ready for the fourth WTO ministerial
conference, scheduled for November 9-13 in the Capital of Doha.
Earlier reports said that Moore, who arrived in Doha late Saturday, is
expected to meet with Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim
Bin Jabir al-Thani to review the final preparations for the conference.
A WTO delegation arrived in Doha on Saturday for a three-day visit
aimed at informing Qatari officials about all issues the world body is
concerned about the preparations for the upcoming meeting.
Qatar has pledged foolproof security and banned the entry of any
foreigners, except those with WTO accreditation.
Qatar claimed on Wednesday that it is going ahead with plans to host
the WTO meeting, dismissing suggestions that the venue should be moved
to Singapore due to security concern.
The move of the meeting would be a major blow to oil-rich Qatar as it
has spent 30 million U.S. dollars on the preparations, said the report.
The Geneva-based trade body has repeatedly stressed that the holding of
the trade conference should remain in Doha.
