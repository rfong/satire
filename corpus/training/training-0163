Hasina's Visit to the U.S. Formally Announced 
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will pay an official visit to the United
States on October 16 to 18 at the invitation of U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Foreign Secretary C. M. Shafi Sami made the official
announcement of the tour date to newsmen at the Foreign Office Monday
evening.
This would be the first-ever visit by any head of government of
Bangladesh at the invitation of a U.S. president, signifying fresh
development in Dhaka-Washington relations.
The prime minister would have meeting and detail talks with President
Clinton at the White House on October 17 on matters of bilateral,
regional and international interests. She will also hold meeting with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Attorney General Ms.
Janet Reno.
A number of agreements, including one on peaceful use of nuclear
energy, are likely to be signed during her stay in Washington at a time
when ties between the two sides are being reshaped in the post-cold-war
era.
Shafi Sami said some other elements of the program are being worked
out. Giving a preview of Hasina's talks with Clinton in Washington, the
foreign secretary said this would be a second summit of the two leaders
in less then six months.
This not only underscores President Clinton's continued interest in
Bangladesh but also reflects the desire of the U.S. government to
reinvigorate bilateral dialogue and cooperation with Bangladesh on a
range of common issues and interests.
Sami said the visit also underlines a strong support of the United
States to the democratic and economic reforms undertaken by the
Bangladeshi government as well as the special emphasis the two
countries give on strengthening bilateral economic, commercial and
scientific relations.
