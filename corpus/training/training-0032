Russia To Consult With Wise Old Woman Of Woods
Reeling from economic chaos, political instability, and a bitter conflict
in Chechnya, Russian leaders announced plans Monday to seek the aid and
advice of "Baba Mat," the Wise Old Woman Who Lives In The Land Of Many Tall
Trees Beyond The Black Mountains.
"We seek the counsel of Baba Mat only as a last resort," Russian
president Vladimir Putin said. "As everyone in the land knows, Baba Mat
can be both benign and malevolent. She can make the lowliest peasant
mightier than a czar and crush a king like a mayfly. But this fearsome
sorceress is our only hope: The people have no bread on their
trenchers, bandits run wild in the streets, and our foreign debt
exceeds $40 billion."
Putin said he hopes to acquire from Baba Mat the Legendary Enchanted
Cod, which can produce a roe of pure gold. He added that his economic
advisers recommended the plan, arguing that the gold would do much to
reduce Russia's hard-currency shortage and outstanding foreign debt, as
well as make Putin the most beloved hero in the land.
Putin's announcement was met with criticism from those familiar with
the wily old hag.
"[The move] shows the extent of Russia's desperation in this
post-Communist era," said Nadine Halberstadt, a professor of Russian
history at Stanford University. "Until now, only children lost in the
forest or exiled princes found an audience with Baba Mat, and it was
certainly not by choice. For all dread Baba Mat, with her hair of
blazing straw, her lanky limbs which she uses to cut the thickest
timbers, her teeth the color of brimstone, and her love of eating
little blond-haired children."
Over the years, Russo-Wise Old Woman relations have been shaky at best.
In the summer of 1968, Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev asked Baba Mat to
supply him with a magic goose egg that would help Soviet troops invade
Czechoslovakia and put down its fledgling reform movement. Baba Mat
would only consent if the Soviet government stopped cutting timber in
the Land Of Many Tall Trees. Brezhnev agreed, the goose egg was
transferred, and Czechoslovakia was successfully invaded.
In the fall of the same year, however, Brezhnev ordered loggers back to
work in the area containing Baba Mat's forest home. An infuriated Baba
Mat avenged the broken deal by locking up the Mystical Rooster Who
Beckons The Rosy-Fingered Dawn in her root cellar for 12 months. The
rooster's imprisonment prevented the sun from rising in the Soviet
Union, destroying the harvest and bringing the nation to a virtual
standstill.
Baba Mat has also been known to dispense punishment in a manner that
can only be seen as arbitrary. In 1985, for reasons that still elude
many Russian experts, she turned Soviet premier Konstantin Chernenko
into a decrepit yak and made him plow her turnip fields until he
collapsed and died. Ten days later, she drank the entire Caspian Sea, a
vital body of water prized for its fisheries and salt deposits and as a
waterway for oil tankers bound northward up the Volga River.
"Put bluntly, Baba Mat is not to be trusted," Halberstadt said. "It is
questionable whether she has ever had Russia's best interests in mind.
And even now, it is widely rumored that the reason Chechnya has been
able to hold off a ferocious Russian attack for months is because the
old woman permitted Chechen rebel leaders to touch the Sacred Talisman
Of Invincibility guarded by the Great Triple-Tusked Boar Of The
Forest."
Particularly critical of Putin is Gennadiy Zyuganov, current leader of
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.
"Given what has happened in the past, Putin is no less than a traitor
for seeking out the double-crossing Baba Mat," Zyuganov said. "It is
beneath a head of state's dignity to consort with a witch. When the
great Lenin formulated his New Economic Policy, he sought the advice
and aid of no less a personage than Jack Frost himself."
As befitting her status as a power broker, Baba Mat frequently exacts a
high price for her assistance. Yuri Suslov, a kindly old woodcutter who
lives at the edge of The Land Of Many Tall Trees, has long been
familiar with the sinister virago's ways.
"I do not envy the Russian president, for Baba Mat will demand of him a
great many things," Suslov said. "For use of the Enchanted Cod, she may
ask of him a feather of the awesome Fire Bird, the Golden Apron of the
Princess Of The Five Steppes, or, most daunting of all, the fabled
Matryoshka Doll Of No Known End. Perhaps all three. She often works in
threes."
When asked for comment by reporters gathered outside her woodland
cottage, Baba Mat said: "Russian, Russian, who dares approach my door;
I'll make your bones rattle to the core! Bring me ambrosia, bring me
mead; then I may give you what you need!"
She then turned the reporters into magpies and flew off into the sky in
her magical black cauldron.
