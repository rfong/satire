Namibia Increases Taxes 
A broad range of tax increases were announced by Namibian Finance
Minister Nangolo Mbumba when he delivered his budget statement for the
1998/99 financial year on Tuesday.
South Africa Press Association (SAPA) Wednesday quoted Mbumba as saying
that general sales tax (GST), additional sales levy (ASL), company tax
and individual income tax for higher-earning Namibians would all
increase.
From May 1, GST on goods would increase from eight to 10 percent, while
GST on services would be lowered from 11 percent to 10 percent. This
should deliver an extra 132 million Namibian Dollars (26 million U.S.
Dollars) to the state's coffers in the coming financial year.
Adjustments in the ASL rate would be mainly in the form of "sin taxes."
Consumers of hard liquor and tobacco products, on which a 15 percent
ASL is currently charged, would be taxed with a 25 percent ASL. The
current 10 percent ASL on beer would also be hiked to 15 percent from
May 1.
The existing GST and ASL would be phased out and replaced by a value
added tax (VAT), which should be in place by April, 1998, Mbumba said.
The company tax rate, excluding mining companies, would be increased
from 35 percent to 40 percent.
Namibians who earn more money would see more of their money going to
the state, with the highest income tax increased from 35 to 40 percent
as from March 1.
Mbumba said not only would existing taxes increase, but the cabinet had
also instructed the Ministry of Finance to investigate new sources of
income for government and to consider introducing a land tax, capital
gains tax, estate duty and stamp duties on stock market transactions.
The tax increases announced on Tuesday were temporary but unavoidable
because of the pressures on the government to make provision for a
possible drought, adjust salaries of lower level government officials
and keep the budget deficit under control among other things, Mbumba
said.
