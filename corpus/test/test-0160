Iraqi army enters Kurdish city after massive dawn attack by Nigah Aram 
Iraqi forces burst into the main Iraqi Kurdish city of Arbil on
Saturday for the first time in five years under a barrage of tank and
artillery fire, opposition groups and witnesses said.
"Our military intervention is limited and aims to help and support" the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) against its rival Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK), Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz told Iraq's official
news agency INA.
But a KDP spokesman in London said he could not confirm that President
Saddam Hussein's forces had intervened on the KDP's side, explaining it
could not make contact with the faction's leader Massud Barzani.
Thousands of Iranian troops backing the PUK crossed into northern Iraq
on Friday and have taken control of a strategic road linking Arbil to
the Iranian border, the spokesman said.
The opposition Iraqi National Congress (INC) said meanwhile that Iraqi
tanks entered the city at around 0700 GMT, and that there were "many
civilian casualties."
INC spokesman Mohammad Abdel Jabbar said the situation was chaotic,
with many people running for shelter. "It is chaos in the town. Anybody
with any sense is fleeing, and many fires have been started by the
shelling."
He said Iraqi soldiers were involved in street fighting with PUK and
INC forces in Arbil, and that the INC still controlled its stronghold
in the town, including radio and television stations.
Jabbar, speaking from London where the INC is based, said more than 100
tanks circled the city earlier Saturday, although an INC official here
told BBC radio there were 300 Iraqi tanks and three divisions of
soldiers around Arbil.
An AFP correspondent saw trucks of KDP fighters take control of the
suburb of Ankawa, five kilometers (three miles) from the centre of
Arbil.
He said yellow KDP flags were flying from buildings around the suburb,
which houses most of the UN organisations working in Arbil, and that
the group's fighters were chanting Barzani's name.
A UN official said at least 10 cililians were killed when shells hit a
factory and a house on the outskirts of Arbil.
Another UN official said the PUK-controlled city of Sulaymaniyah, near
the Iranian border and likewise under the control of the Kurds of
northern Iraq, was also being shelled on Saturday by Iraqi artillery.
