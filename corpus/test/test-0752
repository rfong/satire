Crash in Commodity Market Behind Food Prices Surge in Nigeria 
Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar has pointed out that the crash
in the commodity market is the main cause for the current surge of food
prices in the country, local press reported on Monday.
He also attributed the recent economic standstill to the government's
devaluation of the currency and blamed businessmen in the urban areas
for raising the prices their commodities.
However, the vice president stressed that it will be wrong to draw the
conclusion that the living standard of Nigerians has depreciated in
comparison with what it was last year.
Earlier this year, local economic analysts warned that high prices of
foodstuff could lead to spiraling inflation and lowering people's
living standard. According to the latest statistics, inflation rate in
Nigeria now stands at 18.2 percent.
