63-year-old woman gives birth 
Donatella Della Corte, 63, became the oldest woman in the world to give
birth Monday when her son was born by cesarian section.
The infant was conceived through artificial insemination with the help
of controversial gynecologist Severino Antinori who also delivered the
baby. "Today, it's a 20-year-old woman who gave birth," he said,
meaning that his patient was as well as could be.
Della Corte was implanted with an egg given by a young Italian which
was artificially inseminated with sperm from Della Corte's 65-year-old
husband.
Antinori said that a cesarian delivery had been recommended because
Della Corte had had one to deliver her only other child, a boy who died
when he was 17.
Antinori, who has already helped a 62-year-old Sicilian woman and a
wealthy 59-year-old Briton to have babies, and claims to have helped
more than 30 menopaused women aged over 50 have babies, made no other
comments.
Reliable sources said the doctor and his patient had signed exclusive
250,000 dollar contracts with US and German weeklies to tell their
story. Half the money would go to the new mother, the rest to research.
Della Corte wanted a baby after her only son died in a motorbike
accident when he was 17. News that she was pregnant had caused deep
divisions in the medical world both in Italy and abroad.
In general doctors are not keen on comparatively elderly women having
babies not only because the pregnancy and delivery are a health risk
for the woman but also because of the ethical problems of a child being
brought up by parents old enough to be its grandparents.
When the 59-year-old British woman was delivered of twins in December,
Antinori said that "if pregnancies of women aged between 50 and 60 are
carried out under good conditions, they are not dangerous" for their
health.
