Croatians will take no further military action: Tudjman 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has given assurances to German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd that
Croatian forces will stage any more offensives against rebel Serbs,
Hurd said Tuesday.
"President Tudjman assured us that Croatian forces would take no
further military action. That commitment has to be met," Hurd said
during a House of Commons debate Tuesday.
The foreign secretary said he had an informal meeting with Tudjman in
London during commemorations for the 50th anniversary of Allied victory
in Europe.
Hurd said he had expressed his deep concern and had asked Tudjman to
avoid any fresh military action.
"Chancellor Kohl endorsed my comments," added Hurd.
