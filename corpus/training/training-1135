Overseas Trade Fair In East China 
Today was the last day of the 1997 Jiangsu Overseas Economic and Trade
Fair, which reported 87 agreements at the three-day fair, involving
1.975 billion US dollars worth of foreign investment.
A provincial government official said that 37 of them call for more
than 10 million US dollars worth of funding each.
The foreign investment is mainly for deals in medicines, chemicals,
building materials, machinery, electronics, textiles, food, light
industrial goods and metallurgy, the official added.
Landfill projects at beaches have drawn approximately 90 million US
dollars, and infrastructure like water supplies and garbage disposal
also attracted some funds.
