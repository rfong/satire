``/`` Congress/NNP makes/VBZ the/DT law/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Representative/NNP John/NNP Mica/NNP of/IN the/DT House/NNP Transportation/NNP and/CC Infrastructure/JJ committee/NN ./.

But/CC Representative/NNP Don/NNP Young/NNP ,/, chairman/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP committee/NN ,/, dismissed/VBD that/DT argument/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT events/NNS of/IN September/NNP 11/CD have/VBP dramatically/RB changed/VBN how/WRB we/PRP must/MD defend/VB our/PRP$ planes/NNS and/CC our/PRP$ passengers/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.
