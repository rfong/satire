Ghost Of Anne Frank: 'Quit Reading My Diary'
Shocked to learn that the diary containing her most intimate thoughts
and feelings has been read by millions of people worldwide, the ghost
of Anne Frank held a press conference Monday to tell the world to "stop
reading my diary, and put it back where you found it right this
second."
"I am so embarrassed," Frank said. "I cannot believe that for the last
50 years, millions of people I don't even know have been reading my
diary, reading about my first kiss, my huge crush on the boy upstairs,
my first period--everything."
"It's bad enough to have your sister sneak into your room and read your
diary. But to have it bought by Doubleday and published in 33
languages? That's just mortifying," Frank said. "I knew I should have
gotten one with a lock."
Frank said she first found out about the publication of her diary last
week, when Edward Walther, a recently deceased 57-year-old from
Toronto, approached her in heaven and expressed great admiration for
the young girl's diary.
"He said to me, 'Are you Anne Frank? I can't even begin to tell you how
much your diary has meant to me. I must have read it at least a dozen
times. I've always been particularly moved by your discussion of your
budding sexual curiosity, such as that great longing you felt to touch
that older girl's breasts and the rush of life-affirming exhilaration
you experienced when you got your first period. That kind of
self-awareness and honesty is incredibly rare in any human being, much
less one who's just 15.' And I said, 'What? What are you talking about?
You've read my diary? You know about me and that girl? You know about
me getting my period?' I was absolutely humiliated," Frank said.
Added Frank: "That stuff was supposed to be between me and Kitty."
Frank said she was even more distraught to learn about The Diary Of
Anne Frank, a theatrical version of her private journal currently
playing on Broadway. She called the play--which opened to rave reviews
and was hailed as "powerful, gripping theater" by New York Times drama
critic Vincent Canby--"like, the most embarrassing thing ever in the
history of the world. It's enough to make me want to crawl into a hole
and never show my face again."
Frank said she strongly suspects it was her older sister Margot who
gave the diary to Doubleday. "Margot would do something like that,
stealing my diary from under my bed and getting some major publishing
house to print four million copies of it," Frank said. "I cannot even
tell you how mad I am at her. I swear, if I find out she did this, she
is going to be in such huge trouble."
