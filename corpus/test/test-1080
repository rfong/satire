Construction Worker Killed When Beams Collapse At Olympic Stadium 
One worker was killed and three others were injured Monday when metal
beams holding up a bank of lights collapsed at the Olympic Stadium
under construction in downtown Atlanta.
It was the first fatality and first major accident at a construction
site for the 1996 Summer Games.
Fire Department spokesman Tim Szymanski confirmed the death. He said
three other workers were injured and were taken to Georgia Baptist
Hospital. The hospital, however, said it had received only one person,
who was in critical condition.
The 50-foot (15-meter) beams that collapsed about 11:30 a.m. were
holding up a bank of lights, said Maj. D.M. Neely of the Atlanta
police.
A witness, construction worker Thomas Houston, said the dead worker was
hanging from the beams by a harness when he fell. He said the lights
and the man both landed on the bleachers below, although the lights did
not fall on him.
``When I looked, I saw the guy flipping. He didn't move, man. That was
it,'' Houston said.
Concrete worker Ken Strong, who was working on the bleachers, said he
heard a loud rumbling sound and turned around to see the collapsed
beams.
``All I know is something fell and some people got hurt. I just heard
the tumbling of the lights,'' he said. ``By the time I turned around it
was all over.''
Carol Milliron, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games, said Olympic organizers knew about the accident but had no
details. A woman who answered the phone at Atlanta Stadium
Constructors, the joint venture that is building the structure, said no
one was available to comment.
The stadium, the planned centerpiece of the 1996 Summer Games, was
``topped off'' by union workers last week when steel work was
completed. Part of the ceremony involved hoisting a tree to the top of
the structure, a symbol that no lives had been lost during
construction.
About 120 structural steelworkers began putting the framework up last
summer, about 10 months after groundbreaking. The dlrs 168.8 million
stadium, now a little more than half finished, is to be completed this
fall.
It will be the site of the Games' opening and closing ceremonies, as
well as track and field events.
