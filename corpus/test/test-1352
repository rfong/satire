Foreign Banks Do Well in Chinese Capital
Eleven foreign banks have set up branches in Beijing since the Chinese
capital opened to overseas financial institutions two years ago.
Total capital assets of these foreign bank branches have reached 2.02
billion US dollars by the end of June, an increase of 120 percent on a
year-by-year basis.
The deposits they attracted totalled 400 million dollars and their
accumulative loans amounted to 850 million dollars, up 48 percent and
230 percent respectively over the corresponding period of last year,
according to statistics released by the People's Bank of China Beijing
Branch.
Five foreign banks are reported to begin netting profits, a sign of
smooth operation and rosy business prospects.
