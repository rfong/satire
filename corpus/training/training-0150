Richard Gere, could get banged up in Bombay!
An Indian court has issued an arrest warrant for Hollywood actor
Richard Gere after he kissed Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty at an anti
aids demo.
The Buddhist lothario is quaking in his sandals at the thought of being
immured in Mumbai. Public displays of affection are still largely taboo
in India, and protestors in Bombay set fire to effigies of Gere
following the incident.
"This is far more serious than the threat of aids itself, this could
undermine the fabric of our social structure" said a local solicitor
who hasn't been named as yet, which is a shame for him, as he was
hoping to use this to further his career. "The way I see it" continued
the complete nobody "If I kick up enough stink about this and get my
name connected to Richard Gere or Shilpa Shetty I will make a mint.
Imagine the headlines, local tinpot solicitor puts Richard Gere behind
Bars! That would be genius!"
Shetty has defended Gere saying that "it was all done in good humour.
He told me to tell the media that he didn't slip me the tongue, he said
I should say that we had only been re-enacting a scene from his film
Shall We Dance. I asked him if we could do a scene from one of my
famous films, Bhangdaht-an-koparfeel.
Under Indian law, a person convicted of public obscenity faces up to
three months in prison, a fine or having to star in toothpaste adverts
made entirely in Hindi or, in extreme cases, like Geres, all three.
Gere, star of films such as 9 And a Half Weeks and Lolita, where he
played a 14 year old schoolgirl to critical acclaim, is a Buddhist and
travels to India frequently to visit The Lord Buddha who lives there
because the countryside is nice.
