Human Cloning Comes to Crossroads (Part Two)
Three years ago, 19 European countries signed an agreement banning
human cloning, but such deal has its own flaws. Since not every country
has enacted such ban, scientists with the intention of human cloning
can easily find right sites for their attempt.
Meanwhile, not all scientist oppose human cloning since it is of great
value in helping researchers further understand the meaning of life and
finding new ways of curing diseases.
Researchers at the Roslin Institute, the birthplace of Dolly the Sheep,
have made clear that they support therapeutic cloning, which does not
create whole-body copies of human beings and the purpose of which is to
create early-stage embryos from which stem cells can be harvested.
To Roslin scientists' joy, British lawmakers approved human cloning for
medical purposes just days before Zavos and Antinori's announcement,
making Britain the first nation to pass such law.
Zavos' cloning announcement, however, came at a sensitive time for the
United States: On Friday, President George W. Bush expressed his
personal opposition to federal funding for research that uses tissue
from aborted fetuses. Bush's comments raised concern among some
scientists that he might try to thwart plans to fund
fetal-and-embryo-cell research, which is favored by the U.S. science
community and aims to cure diabetes, Parkinson's disease and other
ailments.
Some scientists have other worries. When cloning fails, it often
results in death at childbirth or soon after birth from deformities.
Zavos said he was well aware that many cloning efforts produce flawed
embryos. But he said existing techniques, and those he and his team
hope to develop soon, would give scientists the ability to determine
which embryos will grow successfully and which are bound to fail.
Zavos also said he and Antinori would hold an international meeting in
Rome in March to consider ethical guidelines and to continue working
out their plan.
