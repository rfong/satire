LUSAKA: final details
South African President Nelson Mandela said Tuesday dos Santos had told
him the government was ready to stop its attacks.
``I am confident that the peace treaty will be signed on Sunday,''
Mandela said after returning to South Africa from Lusaka.
Mandela met in Lusaka with President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Meles
Zenawi of Ethiopia and Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity, to discuss the peace prospects.
Political dynamics have changed with Savimbi's rebels losing virtually
all foreign support -- including that of Washington and South Africa's
former white-minority regime -- and government forces that scored major
victories on the battlefield.
The rebels appear ready to accept limited power-sharing, but the leader
of the UNITA delegation in Lusaka, Gen. Eugenio Manuvakola, was
unwilling to concede defeat.
``In 1975, it was the same, we lost our backing, we lost everything.
But we succeeded to keep the situation for at least one year and then
friends came back,'' he said.
Beye said the Angolan parliament last week approved a general amnesty
for the war, meaning rebel fighters and officials would be free from
prosecution. That likely influenced the rebels to proceed with peace
talks.
The war began as Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975. More
than a half-million people have died and millions are threatened by
starvation and disease.
A 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992 elections and
returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
Rearmed government troops, aided by mercenaries who include retired
South African army officers, launched a counterattack last fall.
