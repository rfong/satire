Albanian government to seek state of emergency ruling by Briseida Mema 
The Albanian government on Tuesday asked parliament to impose a state
of emergency in this southern Albanian town where anti-government
protesters have gone on a rampage burning buildings and attacking
police.
"The situation in Vlore is extraordinary. It calls for extraordinary
measures," Prime Minister Alexander Meski said on national radio,
adding that the country's "constitutional order" had to be protected.
Thousands of people attended the funeral of 30-year-old Arthur Rustemi,
who was shot in the spine in clashes Monday.
"The government is directly to blame for your despair," Kurd Kola, a
former political prisoner and current member of a right-wing opposition
party told the crowd at the cemetery.
Daut Gumeni, another opposition member, urged the population not to
resort to violence and to "throw flowers rather than stones" at the
police.
After the funeral the crowd headed slowly back to central Vlore, where
there was no sign of police troops.
Earlier an angry crowd set fire to the local headquarters of the ruling
Democratic Party while the funeral march turned into an anti-government
protest.
Flames leapt from the two buildings that make up the party headquarters
in a working-class district of Vlore, where two days of riots have left
three dead and more than 150 injured.
Some 100 protesters set the fire, which broke out at the same time as
about 30,000 people -- shouting anti-government slogans -- accompanied
Rustemi's coffin to the cemetery.
The crowd accused police of killing him but the interior ministry said
he was shot in the back by a stray bullet fired by protesters on
Monday.
A woman accompanying the procession wept as she described the victim as
a martyr. Others shouted "the police killed him" and "down with the
criminals."
Demonstrations have shaken Albania for several days, triggered by the
collapse of high-risk investment schemes in which hundreds of thousands
of Albanians had put their life savings.
Many people accuse the government of collusion with those who ran the
fraudulent funds or of failing to act in time to control the schemes.
The government has denied the allegation and blamed the opposition of
fanning unrest.
On Monday, angry crowds threw stones at riot police who were unable to
quell the violence. Some of them were trapped in one building where
they had fled and were let go after removing their uniforms which were
subsequently set ablaze.
Officers who were also trapped at the local police station managed to
leave the building overnight after donning civilian clothing, witnesses
said.
The unrest represented by far the worst violence in a month of protests
across this southern Balkan country since the investment schemes
started to collapse.
The funds, which offered very high interest rates, began to dry up due
to a lack of new investors.
The government has denied responsibility in the investment scams but
has pledged to try to make good the losses of some of the hardest-hit
investors.
The opposition Socialist Party, a revamped group of former communists
who ruled this impoverished country for almost 50 years, has called for
early elections.
