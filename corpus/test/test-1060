Perry Tries to Stop Russian Nuclear Deal With Iran 
Defense Secretary William Perry stepped up pressure on Russia today to
scrap its planned sale of nuclear reactors to Iran, but there was no
indication the government intended to forgo the highly profitable deal.
``Our first objective is to stop the sale,'' Perry told reporters
before meeting Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and other
government officials.
In an hour-long one-on-one session with Grachev at the Ministry of
Defense, Perry made the Clinton administration's case against the
reactor deal. Afterward, Grachev told reporters it was not a matter for
his ministry to decide.
Perry was to discuss it further in a meeting later today with Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Perry was not scheduled to see President
Boris Yeltsin.
Neither the Russians nor the Americans publicly linked it to the Iran
dispute, but Perry announced that the United States was providing an
additional $50 million in aid for Russia's nuclear disarmament,
including $20 million in equipment and services to expedite the
dismantlement of offensive nuclear weapons that are to be eliminated
under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
Perry said Washington was providing an additional $10 million for a
project to re-employ former Russian nuclear weapons scientists on
civilian projects. Also, $17 million will be provided for the
transportation to Russia of nuclear warheads being returned from the
former Soviet republics of Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan; and $3
million for improved warhead storage in Russia.
In his remarks to reporters before talking to Grachev, Perry hinted
that he saw an uphill battle in trying to persuade the Russians not to
complete the Iran deal.
``The sale is a very big economic factor for them,'' he said. ``It
would be a very hard decision for them to make'' to give up the
estimated $1 billion in earnings.
Perry said Washington was opposed to the reactor deal even if Russia
worked out strict controls on how Iran would manage the reactors' spent
fuel, some of which could, with sufficient technical knowhow, be used
to make nuclear weapons.
``Restraints would not give me the comfort factor of simply not having
the reactor'' in Iran's hands, Perry said, adding that Iran has no real
need for the reactors.
``The country is awash in oil,'' Perry said, and thus can meet its
electricity generating requirements without supplementing it with
nuclear power. ``So one starts off being suspicious of why they want
nuclear reactors.''
There is a strong feeling in Moscow that Washington's objections are
rooted in a desire to stop Russia from regaining a foothold in the
Middle Eastern marketplace. That sentiment was expressed Sunday by
Russia's atomic energy minister.
``The United States controlled the (nuclear technology) market for 40
years, Viktor Mikhailov, said in a television interview. ``Now no one
wants us to earn money, too.''
Mikhailov also said Iran ``could not possibly be a nation of
terrorists.''
The United States contends Iran is clandestinely pursuing a nuclear
weapons program, although the Iranian government insists its nuclear
program is strictly civilian.
``I don't think I'm seeing a bogeyman there. I think it's a real
threat,'' Perry said.
The Clinton administration has taken the unusual step of providing
Russian officials with American intelligence on Iran in the hope of
persuading them to drop the sale, The New York Times reported in
today's editions.
American officials said the written intelligence report shows that Iran
has a crash program to build nuclear weapons that would be accelerated
by its deal with Russia. The report also shows that Iran is importing
equipment needed to build nuclear weapons, has sought to buy enriched
uranium from former Soviet republics and is using the same smuggling
techniques that Iraq and Pakistan used in their efforts to build a
nuclear bomb, the newspaper said.
Asked about sharing intelligence with Russia, Perry said today, ``I
don't have any such plan in mind.'' He added, however, that
intelligence data naturally provides the basis for the U.S. assessment
of Iran's nuclear intentions, and in that sense the Russians are being
given the benefit of American intelligence.
In response to questions from reporters, Perry said he did not want the
Iran controversy to interfere with Clinton administration efforts to
help convert Russian defense industries to civilian use.
``We cannot put programs which are very, very important to us as
hostage every time we have a disagreement with Russia,'' Perry said
Sunday.
Perry and Grachev today discussed the fighting in the breakaway
Chechnya region, Russia's ties to NATO, the prospects for ratification
of the START II arms reduction treaty and preparations for President
Clinton's visit here in May.
