New Cancer Treatment Trailed in Australia 
Australian scientists are trailing a new treatment tackling brain
tumors.
The Australian Associated Press reported Tuesday that the new treatment
was known as Stereotaxic Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy which
uses a high intensity beam to focus on the tumor.
It is being trailed at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital. Robert Smee,
a senior oncology specialist of the hospital was quoted by the report
as saying that "We are now able to shape the beam much more precisely
to conform to the tumor in the circumstance where we're giving lower
doses to adjacent normal tissue."
But Smee cautioned that the new treatment was not a panacea for all
brain tumor sufferers and would not necessarily replace surgery or
chemotherapy.
He emphasized that it only gives an alternative means of treatment in
some situations.
