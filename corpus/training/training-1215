Dollar, gold rise 
The dollar rose slightly against other major currencies in quiet
trading here early Thursday as traders awaited the outcome of the Group
of Seven (G7) summit in Canada.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 391.30 dollars an ounce, up 3.00 dollars from
Wednesday's close.
At about 1:00 p.m. (1700 GMT), the dollar was quoted as trading at
1.4100 German marks, up from 1.4007 late Wednesday, and at 84.69 yen
(84.43).
The greenback also climbed to 4.9402 French francs (4.9160), to 1.1675
Swiss francs (1.1555) and to 0.6267 pound sterling (0.6202).
"Nothing is happening. The market is waiting for news from the G7,"
said NationsBank trader Frances Kirkland.
She added that the dollar was likely to fall back next week when it
becomes apparent the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries
meeting in Halifax, Canada, "will make no decision."
The dollar's drop will likely be contained to around 1.3860 German
marks as traders act to avoid central banks intervenign to support the
US currency. Banks from several countries intervened at the end of May
when the greenback fell to 1.3850.
