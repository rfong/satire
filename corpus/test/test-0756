U.S. Criticizes Turkish, Greek moves on Cyprus 
The United States said Thursday that the deployments of F-16 jet
fighters by Greece and Turkey on the divided island of Cyprus would
destabilize the area.
Earlier Thursday, Turkey sent six F-16 war planes to the northern
sector of Cyprus in response to an unprecedented visit by four Greek
F-16s and two C-130 transport planes to the southern Cypriot air base
this week.
"It's destabilizing to the area," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told
a briefing. "This is a matter of concern to us obviously."
He said he did not anticipate a U.S. military response to mounting
tension on Cyprus, calling diplomacy the "appropriate response." But
Bacon said the aircraft carrier Eisenhower and its battle group would
arrive in the Mediterranean on or about Saturday after its June 8
departure from its home port in Norfolk, Virginia.
The Eisenhower, once it reached the region, "will be available for any
needs she has to meet there," Bacon said.
President Bill Clinton's special envoy to resolve the Cyprus deadlock,
Richard Holbrooke, said Thursday that the situation there was grave and
it was "not progressing positively right now."
