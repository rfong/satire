Vivendi Universal launches capital restructuring at utilities unit
French media giant Vivendi Universal launched a far-reaching capital
restructuring of its utilities unit Vivendi Environnement Monday that will
reduce its stake in the division from 63 to 42 percent.
Vivendi Universal said it would hold its Vivendi Environnment shares
for 18 months. Financial institutions would maintain between six and 13
percent of Vivendi Environnement for a period of six months.
The deal also calls for the sale of 53.8 million shares in Vivendi
Environnement, or 15.5 percent of the capital, as well as an increase
in the unit's capital of 1.5 billion euros (1.46 billion dollars).
Vivendi Universal, the world's second largest media concern after AOL
TimeWarner, said in a statement the operation should lead to a
reduction of 1.7 billion euros in its overall debt of 17.5 billion
euros.
"With the increase in its capital, Vivendi Environnement will have
access to greater financial resources to ensure its development as well
as increased financial flexibility," it added.
The financial insitutions that have agreed to maintain a six to 13
percent stake in Vivendi Environnement for six months are Caisse des
Depots et Consignations, Groupama, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale,
Dexia, AGF, Caisse d'Epargne, Credit Lyonnais and Natexis Banques
Populaires.
