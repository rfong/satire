Simpson Judge Orders Battered Women's Shelter To Give Court Papers 
The judge in the trial of former football star O.J. Simpson on
Wednesday ordered a battered women's shelter that may have served
Simpson's slain ex-wife to turn over documents for the judge's review.
The order from Superior Court Judge Lance Ito began a day dedicated to
the exploration of domestic violence in Simpson's relationship with
Nicole Brown Simpson. The session was considered so inflammatory the
jury was sequestered before it started.
The Sojourn shelter in Santa Monica expressed worries about the cost
and impact on the privacy of its clients of complying with the
prosecution's Dec. 29 subpoena to produce documents linked to Ms.
Simpson.
``Sojourn is concerned that strict confidentiality be maintained,''
said shelter attorney Pamela A. Withey.
Simpson is charged with killing Ms. Simpson and her friend Ronald
Goldman in June. The crime and legal proceedings have been highly
publicized in the United States.
The judge ruled that a waiver of confidentiality signed by Ms.
Simpson's father, Louis Brown, allowed for the release of the
documents. But the judge said the documents should be submitted under
seal to him first.
Ito also said the district attorney's office should reimburse Sojourn
for the cost of going through paperwork to see if anything there
pertained to Ms. Simpson. The shelter never publicly acknowledged
serving Ms. Simpson.
Ito said earlier there were ``two dozen discrete incidents or issues''
of domestic abuse to address. They include a limousine driver who
reportedly saw Simpson beating Ms. Simpson as he drove them home from a
Rodeo Drive charity event, according to Wednesday's New York Daily
News.
