US Official on India Becoming APEC Member 
A visiting US senior official has said that India could become a member
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) by further opening up
its economy.
Mrs. Joan Edelman Spero, US under-secretary of state for economic,
business and agricultural affairs, came here to participate in the
inauguration of the first meeting of the revitalized US-Indian
Economic/Commercial subcommission held here Monday.
"India should increasingly open up its economy to the level of other
APEC members and remain in constant dialogue with various working
groups set up by the APEC to become a member," she said.
APEC embraces Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, the US, Canada,
Australia, Japan, Brunei, South Korea, New Zealand, the Philippines,
Thailand, Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei, Mexico, Papua New Guinea and
Chile.
India is keenly interested to become a member of the APEC and has made
great efforts to this end. There is no APEC constitution on APEC
membership. APEC planned not to have more membership at the moment.
The subcommission was chosen by Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao and US President Bill Clinton during the former's visit to the US
in May last year as a forum for resuming an active bilateral dialogue
on economic and commercial issues of mutual interest.
