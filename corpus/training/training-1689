Vaccine Found to Cure Foot-and-mouth Disease 
By using a virus exploited from tobacco, scientists in Shanghai have
successfully produced a kind of medical vaccine proven to be effective
in curing foot-and-mouth disease.
Before this, no effective vaccine has been reportedly found to be able
to cure the disease, a major threat to livestock worldwide.
Scientists in Shanghai found that pathogens threatening human beings
and animals do not infect vegetation, therefore, they came up with the
idea of using vegetation as a biological reactor to produce a vaccine
to be used on human beings and animals.
After testing the vaccine on mice carrying the foot-and-mouth virus,
scientists found that their immune system was strengthened because of
the vaccine and successfully enabled the mice to withstand the virus.
They believe that this new technology can be used to produce vaccines
that are not only helpful for animals, but also for human beings and
that since tobacco grows quickly the production cost will be relatively
low.
