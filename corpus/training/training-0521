Philippines aims to spur APEC economic liberalization agenda 
The Philippines plans to spur economic liberalization among Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation members (APEC) when it hosts a summit of
the forum in 1996, President Fidel Ramos said Thursday.
"As APEC chair, it is up to us to energize, coordinate and harmonize
the actions of the member economies concerted implementation of the
APEC agenda," Ramos said in a speech here.
APEC leaders adopted an action plan at their summit in Osaka, Japan
last month aimed at ensuring free trade and investment by 2010 among
its industrialised members and by 2020 for developing economies.
"We must blaze the trail that others will follow. We must steer APEC
toward sustained implementation of the broad agenda," Ramos said.
The Philippine president excluded the possibility of compelling members
to reach the liberalisation target.
"The barriers to free and open trade and investments in the region will
come down not through compulsion or bargaining but through the
willingness and desire of our economies to open themselves to each
other," he said.
"The pace and extent of liberalization will very according to each
member country's readiness."
Ramos did not specify how the Philippines would work for greater
liberalization but said that its task as host "must be to keep this
idea in the forefront of everyone's mind.
"We must build confidence in the full and total vindication of the APEC
vision."
The Philippines will host the APEC summit in November 1996, including
many of the preparatory meetings.
Some congressmen and the press have complained that the money spent in
hosting such a summit could be better spent elsewhere in this
impoverished nation.
However Ramos said hosting the summit would allow the Philippines to
showcase its economic recovery, attract more foreign investment and
forge closer economic links with other countries.
