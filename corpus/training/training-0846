Pakistani PM Orders Inquiry into Karachi Murder 
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto orders inquiry here today into
the murder of Nasir Hussain and Arif Hussain, brother and nephew of
Altaf Hussain, leader of the ethnic Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM).
Press reports said that Nasir Hussain and his son Arif were found dead
in Karachi Saturday.
Presiding over a law and order meeting, the prime minister expressed
her grief and outrage over the kidnapping and subsequent murders
Saturday in the southern port city of Karachi.
She ordered the concerned law enforcement agencies to "immediately go
into the depth of the case and expose and arrest the real culprits
behind the gory incident," said the official Associated Press of
Pakistan.
The MQM (Altaf Group) alleged that the law enforcement agencies had
kidnapped Nasir Hussain and his son Thursday evening.
The provincial government and the law enforcement agencies promptly
rebutted the allegations.
The meeting was also informed that the provincial government had
ordered a judicial inquiry into the murder.
Provincial Minister for Planning and Development Nisar Ahmed Khuhro
told a press conference in Karachi today the inquiry will be open to
the public.
The minister declared that the government will not spare any effort to
bring the killers of Nasir and Arif to book and get them exemplary
punishment.
Due to the conflict between the government and the MQM (A), more than
1,700 people have been killed in city violence in Karachi this year.
The MQM (A) had called for a one-day strike today against the arrest of
its activists and extended it to three days due to the murders.
