``Killing Fields'' producer David Putnam and a conscientous street
cleaner were among 1,200 Britons Queen Elizabeth II recognized Saturday
in her New Year Honors List.
Elizabeth Smith, 54, the widow of Labor Party leader John Smith, was
one of only two people to receive the top honor of a life peerage in
the House of Lords. The other was Sarah Hogg, 48, a former adviser to
Conservative Prime Minister John Major.
Among those receiving lesser honors was Richard Currie, who has swept
the streets of the small southern English town of Alton for decades. He
kept up the sidewalks even while recovering from a mugging in 1992.
Currie received an MBE, initials he can now put after his name to
signify Member of the British Empire.
That honor ranked a level above the Order of the British Empire awarded
Saturday to the billionaire Duke of Westminster, who inherited with his
ancient title a chunk of London's elegant Belgravia district. He
received an OBE for being a part-time soldier.
Another prominent OBE was Eric Clapton, for his contribution to music.
Nicknamed ``Slowhand,'' after one of his own songs, Clapton has
overcome a heroin addiction and the 1991 death of his infant son to
secure a place as perhaps the world's best-known guitar stylist.
The 30 new knights named Saturday -- people who get the title ``Sir''
or ``Dame'' -- spanned business, education, politics, the judiciary and
the arts.
Among them was producer David Puttnam, whose movies include ``Chariots
of Fire'' in 1981 and 1984's ``The Killing Fields.'' Puttnam is a
constant critic of the government's refusal to subsidize the British
film industry.
Other new knights included Rocco Forte, chairman and chief executive of
the Forte hotel and fast food chain, and actor Robert Stephens.
For the new Lady Smith, who has taken little part in public life, the
title appeared to reflect recognition of her husband as a well-liked
politician who might have been the next prime minister.
John Smith died of heart failure in May.
The appointment of Lady Hogg, 48, to life membership of the unelected
upper House of Lords raised speculation that Major intends to name her
to his Cabinet. Government ministers must all be members of Parliament,
although most come from the elected House of Commons.
The honors -- knighthoods, peerages and medals -- are awarded twice a
year, at New Year's and on the queen's official birthday in June. The
awards are announced in the queen's name, but are made by the
government.
Prime Minister Major has sought to reform the honors system so that it
is less dominated by establishment figures and civil servants nearing
retirment. He began inviting nominations from members of the public
three years ago.
That process runs alongside one dating from the 13th century, when
Britain's monarchs began rewarding subjects with knighthoods.
The honors list traditionally includes loyal royal servants and aides
who receive the Royal Victorian Order.
Saturday's recipients included Elizabeth, the Lady Grimthorpe, whose
job is designated Lady of the Bedchamber of the 94-year-old Queen
Mother.
