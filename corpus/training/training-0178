2.5 Million Chinese Traveled Abroad In 1997 
China's Public Security Ministry said today that a record 2.56 million
Chinese went abroad in 1997, an increase of 7 percent from 1996.
Of that number, 878,000 got permits to visit Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan.
The majority of these travellers, or 1.065 million, were tourists, a
5.6 percent increase from the previous year. Over 677,000 people went
to visit relatives or friends.
Last year, China's public security departments gave permits to nearly
50,000 people, including 14,000 children of Hong Kong permanent
residents, to resettle in Hong Kong, and 1,880 people in Macao.
Among the 57,000 mainland residents approved to visit Taiwan last year,
47,000 visited relatives or attended the funeral of a family member.
Some 8,400 people were invited to Taiwan for various cross-Straits
exchanges, and more than 2,000 were dealing with economic exchanges and
trade.
