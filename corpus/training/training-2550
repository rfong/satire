Newcastle's new hero instead finds himself out in the cold, with
Venables gambling on Collymore's fitness and retaining former Tottenham
favourite Teddy Sheringham.
In midfield Venables has ignored the claims of another early season
success, Aston Villa's Mark Draper.
The niggling groin injury which has restricted Gascoigne's British
comeback with Rangers is unlikely to bring him into contention since he
has had only two full games since his return from Italy.
Graham Le Saux and Stuart Pearce retain the left back positions. Leeds
Tony Dorigo, so often Pearce's deputy, is again left frustrated despite
his excellent start to the season.
