Hasina Sworn in as Bangladeshi Prime Minister 
Sheikh Hasina, president of the Awami (people's) League (AL) in
Bangladesh, was sworn in here this afternoon as the country's new prime
minister.
President Abdur Rahman Biswas administered the oath-taking.
Immediately after the swearing-in of the prime minister, 11 ministers
and 8 state ministers of the cabinet also took oath.
Hasina, 49, whose party has become the largest party in the country's
seventh parliament after the general elections held on June 12 by
winning 146 out of 300 seats, is expected to address the nation over
radio and television tonight after taking the oath of office.
Saturday afternoon, President Biswas met with the AL chief and extended
an invitation to her to form the new government.
"Yes, the president has invited me to form the government and we have
decided to form the government tomorrow (Sunday) as it is the founding
day of the Awami League," she, appearing relaxed, said after the
meeting. "It's people's victory."
Hasina, the eldest daughter of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the
father of the nation who was the first head of state after Bangladesh
won independence in 1971, was elected AL president in 1981, six years
after she escaped from an assassination during which her father, mother
and three brothers were killed by some disgruntled army officers.
Elected as the leader of the opposition in the parliament, Hasina led
her AL and the opposition alliance in launching prolonged campaigns
against the military rule of the then H.M. Ershad regime in the 1980s
and the immediate government of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
over the past few years.
