The/DT pilots/NNS had/VBD just/RB been/VBN told/VBN they/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO wait/VB 10/CD minutes/NNS to/TO be/VB cleared/VBN to/TO land/NN ./.

A/DT transcript/NN of/IN their/PRP$ conversation/NN ,/, released/VBN Monday/NNP by/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Aviation/NNP Administration/NNP ,/, shows/VBZ air/NN traffic/NN controllers/NNS trying/VBG to/TO get/VB the/DT pilots/NNS to/TO respond/VB and/CC asking/VBG pilots/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN about/IN the/DT weather/NN ,/, which/WDT included/VBD heavy/JJ rain/NN and/CC sleet/NN ./.

The/DT transcript/NN offered/VBD no/DT clear/JJ indication/NN of/IN the/DT cause/NN of/IN the/DT crash/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ being/VBG investigated/VBN by/IN the/DT National/NNP Transportation/NNP Safety/NNP Board/NNP ./.

The/DT safety/NN board/NN said/VBD Monday/NNP that/IN it/PRP would/MD hold/VB a/DT hearing/NN on/IN the/DT crash/NN on/IN Feb./NNP 27/CD in/IN Indianapolis/NNP ./.

The/DT crash/NN was/VBD the/DT third/JJ involving/VBG a/DT plane/NN made/VBN by/IN Avions/NNP de/IN Transport/NNP Regional/NNP ,/, a/DT French-Italian/JJ consortium/NN ./.

The/DT fourth/JJ accident/NN occurred/VBD Monday/NNP ,/, when/WRB an/DT ATR-72/NN crashed/VBD into/IN a/DT mountain/NN south/NN of/IN Taipei/NNP ,/, Taiwan/NNP ,/, during/IN a/DT training/NN flight/NN ,/, killing/VBG four/CD crew/NN members/NNS ./.

ATR/NNP officials/NNS said/VBD that/IN plane/NN was/VBD flying/VBG at/IN an/DT altitude/NN of/IN about/RB four/CD thousand/CD feet/NNS when/WRB it/PRP crashed/VBD 12.5/CD miles/NNS from/IN Taipei/NNP ./.

The/DT plane/NN ,/, flying/VBG through/IN drizzle/NN ,/, was/VBD about/IN to/TO overtake/VB a/DT slower/JJR plane/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD asked/VBN to/TO circle/NN to/TO put/VB more/JJR distance/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD planes/NNS ,/, said/VBD Kathryn/NNP Creedy/NNP ,/, an/DT ATR/NNP spokeswoman/NN ./.

The/DT temperature/NN at/IN the/DT airport/NN was/VBD above/IN 55/CD degrees/NNS ,/, she/PRP said/VBD ./.

In/IN the/DT Roselawn/NNP crash/NN ,/, the/DT effect/NN of/IN icing/VBG on/IN the/DT plane/NN 's/POS performance/NN is/VBZ suspected/VBN of/IN being/VBG a/DT possible/JJ cause/NN of/IN the/DT crash/NN ./.

The/DT safety/NN board/NN said/VBD that/IN in/IN the/DT hearing/NN it/PRP would/MD also/RB examine/VB air/NN traffic/NN control/NN ,/, weather/NN and/CC the/DT aircraft/NN 's/POS design/NN and/CC systems/NNS as/IN possible/JJ factors/NNS in/IN the/DT crash/NN ./.

Safety/NNP board/NN officials/NNS said/VBD yesterday/NN that/IN on/IN the/DT first/JJ day/NN of/IN the/DT hearing/NN they/PRP planned/VBD to/TO release/VB a/DT transcript/NN of/IN the/DT pilots/NNS '/POS conversation/NN in/IN the/DT cockpit/NN before/IN the/DT crash/NN ./.

In/IN early/JJ December/NNP ,/, the/DT FAA/NNP banned/VBD the/DT plane/NN from/IN flying/VBG in/IN icing/VBG conditions/NNS ./.

The/DT ban/NN followed/VBD wind/NN tunnel/NN and/CC runway/NN taxi/NN tests/NNS monitored/VBD by/IN the/DT agency/NN ./.

In/IN those/DT tests/NNS ,/, unusually/RB shaped/JJ mockups/NNS of/IN ice/NN buildup/NN were/VBD placed/VBN on/IN the/DT wing/NN and/CC were/VBD found/VBN to/TO disrupt/VB roll/NN control/NN ./.

On/IN Jan./NNP 11/CD ,/, the/DT agency/NN lifted/VBD the/DT ban/NN after/IN ATR/NNP proposed/VBD a/DT series/NN of/IN short-term/JJ procedural/JJ changes/NNS and/CC a/DT longer-term/JJ solution/NN that/WDT requires/VBZ the/DT company/NN to/TO enlarge/VB the/DT de-icing/JJ system/NN on/IN the/DT leading/VBG edge/NN of/IN the/DT wings/NNS ./.

The/DT transcript/NN released/VBN Monday/NNP shows/VBZ that/IN Flight/NNP 4184/NNP first/RB contacted/VBD Chicago/NNP 's/POS radar/NN control/NN center/NN at/IN 3:13/CD p.m./RB ,/, reporting/VBG that/IN its/PRP$ altitude/NN was/VBD 16,000/CD feet/NNS ./.

Five/CD minutes/NNS later/RB ,/, traffic/NN controllers/NNS gave/VBD the/DT pilots/NNS a/DT string/NN of/IN instructions/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT pilot/NN flying/VBG the/DT plane/NN said/VBD :/: ``/`` Wow/VBG ./.

That/DT 's/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN numbers/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP got/VBD it/PRP ./. ''/''

He/PRP accurately/RB repeated/VBD them/PRP back/RP to/TO air/VB traffic/NN controllers/NNS ,/, who/WP apologized/VBD for/IN not/RB warning/VBG the/DT pilot/NN beforehand/RB about/RB the/DT lengthy/JJ instructions/NNS ./.

``/`` That/DT 's/VBZ all/RB right/JJ ,/, ''/'' the/DT pilot/NN responded/VBD ./.

``/`` I/PRP just/RB wrote/VBD all/DT over/IN my/PRP$ arm/NN ./. ''/''

At/IN 3:19/CD p.m./RB ,/, the/DT pilot/NN told/VBD controllers/NNS that/IN he/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO decrease/VB speed/NN ./.

``/`` We/PRP 're/VBP gonna/JJ slow/JJ down/RB out/IN here/RB if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mind/VB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

Safety/NNP board/NN investigators/NNS said/VBD in/IN November/NNP that/IN Flight/NNP 4184/NNP 's/POS holding/VBG speed/NN before/IN the/DT crash/NN ranged/VBD from/IN 175/CD knots/NNS to/TO 185/CD knots/NNS ./.

After/IN flying/VBG in/IN a/DT holding/VBG pattern/NN for/IN about/RB 36/CD more/RBR minutes/NNS ,/, Flight/NNP 4184/NNP was/VBD told/VBN by/IN traffic/NN controllers/NNS that/IN it/PRP ``/`` should/MD be/VB about/RB 10/CD minutes/NNS ,/, uh/UH ,/, till/IN you/PRP 're/VBP cleared/VBN in/IN ./.

The/DT pilot/NN thanked/VBD the/DT controllers/NNS ./.

By/IN the/DT time/NN the/DT controllers/NNS started/VBD calling/VBG for/IN the/DT pilot/NN to/TO respond/VB ,/, the/DT FAA/NNP calculated/VBD ,/, the/DT plane/NN had/VBD already/RB crashed/VBN ./.

For/IN the/DT next/JJ 16/CD minutes/NNS ,/, the/DT controllers/NNS asked/VBD 17/CD times/NNS for/IN Flight/NNP 4184/CD to/TO respond/VB ./.

During/IN that/DT time/NN ,/, they/PRP also/RB asked/VBD other/JJ planes/NNS about/IN the/DT weather/NN ./.
