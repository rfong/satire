Hyundai to invest 1.1 billion dollars in Indian car plant 
South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. said Wednesday it planned to invest 1.1
billion dollars in a car plant it is building in India.
Yang Soo Kim, chairman of Hyundai Motor (India) told reporters here
that the state-of-the-art plant in the southern city of Sriperumbudur,
would have an annual production capacity of 120,000 passenger cars.
"The plant will be ready by October next year," he said.
Work on the car factory, Hyundai's largest outside South Korea, began
last month.
Hyundai has a 48 percent share of the South Korean motor market. It is
among the 12 biggest auto makers in the world with annual turnover of
13 billion dollars.
Hyundai plans to launch two Accent models in India, aiming for sales
among the 200-million-plus middle-class which has attracted a host of
foreign players since New Delhi's sweeping market reforms of 1991.
Automobile giants such as Mercedes-Benz, Ford Motor Co., Honda and PSA
Peugeot-Citroen have since entered India to grab a slice of the
burgeoning market, estimated to be growing annually by some 25 percent.
