Bob Dole, cruising to nomination, takes three more primaries 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, already a shoo-in for the Republican
nomination to challenge Bill Clinton for the presidency in November,
easily won three more primary elections Tuesday.
He dominated the Republican polls in North Carolina, Indiana and in
Washington D.C., according to partial returns.
Preliminary vote counts showed Dole commanding in both North Carolina
and Indiana with 71 percent and in Washington, with 78 percent of the
ballot.
The results came as little surprise after rival Pat Buchanan, faced
with Dole's previous overwhelming victories, scaled back his campaign
for the Republican Party candidacy to the presidency last month.
Dole, a senator from Kansas, was widely expected to capture the
majority of the 124 delegates up for grabs in Tuesday's ballots.
After taking the primaries of California, Nevada and Washington state
March 26, Dole is assured the backing of more than 1,200 delegates,
already more than enough for the nomination.
The official nomination will be made at the San Diego, California
Republican Party national convention in August.
The next Republican primaries are set for May 14 in Nebraska and West
Virginia.
Dole continues to trail President Clinton, 33 to 64 percent, according
to a Louis Harris poll released Tuesday.
