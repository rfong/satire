Political Action Committees Back in Presidential Race 
Political action committees have already written checks worth 1.5
million dollars to Republican presidential hopefuls.
Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner, has collected nearly 608,000
dollars for his presidential bid in the first six months of this year,
according to Federal Election Commission records.
Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas is second with 297,000 dollars, followed by
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander with just over 200,000 dollars
and California Gov. Pete Wilson at 182,000 dollars, according to an
Associated Press report.
As four years ago, President Bill Clinton is refusing PAC donations.
PACs are the donating arms of special interest groups, and can
contribute up to 5,000 dollars per candidate per election.
Some PACs are contributing to more than one candidates.
In 1992 the major candidates, including Bill Clinton, George Bush and
Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, agreed
not to take donations from PACs, in response to public criticism that
candidates had become too reliant on special interest money.
As a result, PACs donated just 782,967 dollars to presidential
candidates during the 1992 election cycle, according to the FEC.
