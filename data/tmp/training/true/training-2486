Beshir/NNP :/: the/DT ``/`` Islamic/JJ coup/NN ''/'' general/NN who/WP has/VBZ led/VBN Sudan/NNP to/TO ruin/VB Seven/CD years/NNS after/IN a/DT military/JJ coup/NN put/VBD his/PRP$ ``/`` Islamic/JJ revolution/NN ''/'' in/IN power/NN ,/, Sudanese/NNP President/NNP Omar/NNP al-Beshir/NN ,/, facing/VBG elections/NNS for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, has/VBZ led/VBN his/PRP$ country/NN into/IN isolation/NN and/CC economic/JJ ruin/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, Beshir/NNP is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO easily/RB win/VB in/IN the/DT vote/NN to/TO begin/VB March/NNP 6/CD ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT opposition/NN has/VBZ declared/VBN a/DT boycott/NN ,/, no/DT political/JJ parties/NNS are/VBP allowed/VBN ,/, and/CC his/PRP$ 40/CD competitors/NNS in/IN the/DT race/NN are/VBP all/DT unknowns/NNS ./.

The/DT general/NN 's/POS opponents/NNS say/VBP the/DT elections/NNS aim/VBP only/RB to/TO soften/VB the/DT image/NN of/IN his/PRP$ regime/NN which/WDT is/VBZ plagued/VBN by/IN accusations/NNS of/IN supporting/VBG terrorism/NN ,/, human/JJ rights/NNS violations/NNS and/CC a/DT deterioriating/VBG economy/NN ./.

Sudan/NNP 's/POS neighbors/NNS ,/, who/WP quickly/RB recognized/VBD Beshir/NNP 's/POS 1989/CD bloodless/NN coup/NN ,/, now/RB stand/VBP almost/RB unanimously/RB against/IN it/PRP ,/, accusing/VBG it/PRP of/IN stirring/VBG up/RP unrest/NN on/IN their/PRP$ soil/NN ./.

Placed/VBN on/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS '/POS list/NN of/IN nations/NNS backing/VBG terrorism/NN in/IN 1993/CD ,/, Sudan/NNP now/RB may/MD face/VB international/JJ sanctions/NNS after/IN a/DT UN/NNP resolution/NN last/JJ month/NN demanding/VBG it/PRP hand/NN over/IN to/TO Ethiopia/NNP three/CD fugitive/VB Moslem/NNP militants/NNS ./.

General/NNP Beshir/NNP has/VBZ responded/VBN by/IN insisting/VBG on/IN his/PRP$ country/NN 's/POS innocence/NN and/CC by/IN loudly/RB condemning/VBG the/DT ``/`` international/JJ conspiracy/NN ''/'' against/IN it/PRP ,/, all/RB the/DT while/NN vowing/VBG to/TO preserve/VB Sudan/NNP 's/POS ``/`` Islamic/JJ character/NN ./. ''/''

Moreover/RB ,/, Sudan/NNP has/VBZ seen/VBN a/DT collapse/NN of/IN its/PRP$ currency/NN from/IN five/CD pounds/NNS to/TO the/DT dollar/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN the/DT coup/NN to/TO the/DT current/JJ rate/NN in/IN private/JJ exchanges/NNS of/IN 950/NNP to/TO the/DT dollar/NN ./.

The/DT president/NN 's/POS enemies/NNS dismiss/VBP him/PRP as/IN a/DT figurehead/JJ for/IN his/PRP$ government/NN 's/POS spiritual/JJ leader/NN ,/, Hassan/NNP Turabi/NNP ,/, head/NN of/IN the/DT National/NNP Islamic/NNP Front/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- NIF/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

A/DT career/NN military/JJ man/NN ,/, Beshir/NNP came/VBD to/TO power/NN heading/VBG a/DT 15-member/JJ military/JJ junta/NN which/WDT toppled/VBD the/DT elected/VBN government/NN of/IN Sadeq/NNP al-Mahdi/NNP and/CC dissolved/VBN political/JJ parties/NNS in/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS fourth/JJ army/NN coup/NN since/IN independence/NN in/IN 1956/CD ./.

He/PRP immediately/RB vowed/VBD to/TO put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO the/DT bloody/JJ civil/JJ war/NN between/IN northern/JJ Moslems/NNS and/CC southern/JJ Christians/NNS and/CC animists/NNS ,/, announcing/VBG a/DT unilateral/JJ ceasefire/NN and/CC seeking/VBG peace/NN talks/NNS through/IN Kenyan/JJ mediators/NNS ./.

But/CC his/PRP$ insistence/NN on/IN maintaining/VBG Islamic/NNP Sharia/NNP law/NN instituted/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ predecessors/NNS alienated/VBD southern/JJ rebels/NNS ./.

The/DT war/NN ,/, now/RB entering/VBG its/PRP$ 13th/JJ year/NN ,/, rages/VBD on/RP and/CC has/VBZ left/VBN well/RB over/IN a/DT million/CD dead/NN ./.

Only/RB months/NNS before/IN the/DT coup/NN ,/, Beshir/NNP had/VBD been/VBN promoted/VBN to/TO brigadier/VB in/IN the/DT army/NN for/IN capturing/VBG one/CD of/IN the/DT southern/JJ rebels/NNS '/POS main/JJ strongholds/NNS ./.

After/IN taking/VBG power/NN ,/, he/PRP promoted/VBD himself/PRP to/TO lieutenant/NN general/NN and/CC commander/NN in/IN chief/NN ./.

The/DT president/NN told/VBD a/DT television/NN interviewer/NN recently/RB he/PRP had/VBD long/RB planned/VBN to/TO seize/VB power/NN ``/`` to/TO save/VB the/DT country/NN from/IN the/DT decrepit/JJ political/JJ parties/NNS ''/'' which/WDT had/VBD run/VBN it/PRP under/IN Mahdi/NNP ./.

Beshir/NNP ,/, 53/CD ,/, was/VBD born/VBN to/TO an/DT itinerant/JJ farm/NN worker/NN and/CC an/DT illiterate/JJ mother/NN in/IN the/DT tiny/JJ village/NN of/IN Hosh/NNP Bannaga/NNP ,/, 150/CD kilometers/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 90/CD miles/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- north/RB of/IN Khartoum/NNP ./.

He/PRP told/VBD television/NN that/IN even/RB in/IN secondary/JJ school/NN his/PRP$ ``/`` inborn/NN Islamic/NN leanings/NN ''/'' kept/VBD him/PRP from/IN joining/VBG Communist/JJ students/NNS urging/VBG him/PRP to/TO cooperate/VB with/IN them/PRP ./.

But/CC he/PRP also/RB turned/VBD down/RP Islamic/JJ fundamentalist/JJ students/NNS ,/, instead/RB entering/VBG the/DT military/NN ,/, where/WRB he/PRP began/VBD as/IN an/DT airborne/JJ units/NNS officer/NN ./.

He/PRP later/RB served/VBD in/IN the/DT south/NN ,/, becoming/VBG commander/NN of/IN the/DT eighth/JJ army/NN infantry/NN brigade/NN ./.

Ironically/RB ,/, after/IN taking/VBG paratrooper/NN and/CC higher/JJR military/JJ sources/NNS in/IN Cairo/NNP ,/, Beshir/NNP earned/VBD a/DT medal/NN from/IN the/DT Egyptian/JJ military/NN for/IN serving/VBG alongside/IN it/PRP in/IN a/DT Sudanese/NNP infantry/NN unit/NN against/IN the/DT Israelis/NNPS in/IN the/DT 1973/CD war/NN ./.

Now/RB Cairo/NNP accuses/VBZ his/PRP$ government/NN of/IN training/VBG ,/, arming/VBG and/CC financing/VBG Egyptian/JJ Moslem/NNP militants/NNS who/WP attempted/VBD to/TO kill/VB Egyptian/NNP President/NNP Hosni/NNP Mubarak/NNP in/IN Addis/NNP Ababa/NNP last/JJ June/NNP ./.

The/DT Sudanese/NNP leader/NN keeps/VBZ a/DT tight/JJ lid/NN on/IN his/PRP$ private/JJ life/NN ,/, but/CC is/VBZ known/VBN to/TO have/VB married/VBN in/IN the/DT early/JJ 1970s/NNS ,/, although/IN he/PRP has/VBZ no/DT children/NNS ./.

One/CD of/IN his/PRP$ six/CD brothers/NNS was/VBD killed/VBN last/JJ month/NN fighting/VBG against/IN southern/JJ rebels/NNS ./.
