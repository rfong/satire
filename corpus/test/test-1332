Campese under pressure ahead of 100 cap target 
Test rugby's leading try scorer, David Campese, is back in the
Australian side but not counting on achieving his ambition of winning
100 caps.
The 33-year-old winger will win his 93rd cap against Wales in Brisbane
on Saturday because Queensland's Ben Tune is injured.
Tune was a virtual certainty to make his test debut before he was
injured on Saturday against New South Wales and, with Jason Little is
also injured, the selectors picked Joe Roff at centre, freeing up a
wing spot.
"He (Tune) is an extremely good player, it was just unfortunate he got
injured. I'm just glad I'm here now," Campese said Monday.
"You've got to look at it realistically.
"I've just got to take this test as it comes, I'm not going to worry
about anything else. I feel I've still got something to offer."
Apart from being Australian rugby's most capped player, Campese, who
made his debut against New Zealand 14 seasons ago, has scored a world
record 63 international tries.
The team's new captain John Eales believes the Wallabies are ready to
make the fresh start they need to again become the world's best.
The 25-year-old, one of the best second-rowers in the world, said it
was time for the Wallabies to forget past triumphs and catch up with
the rest of the world again.
Eales, who will be playing in his 32nd international on Saturday,
targeted in particular World Cup winners South Africa and runners-up
New Zealand.
"After the World Cup last year, which was very disappointing for us,
we've got to start again in a lot of ways," said Eales.
Australia won just four of their eight internationals last season --
losing all their major matches against South Africa and England in the
World Cup and the two Bledisloe Cup games with New Zealand.
Australia now have a new selection panel headed by former test centre
Michael Hawker, a new coach with Greg Smith replacing Bob Dwyer, a new
captain because Phil Kearns is injured and three new caps -- prop
Richard Harry, hooker Marco Caputo and flanker Owen Finegan.
Just six of the players beaten 34-23 by the All Blacks in Sydney last
July will play against the Welsh tourists.
"We've got to concern ourselves with what we're doing and the way we
are playing the game in all matches, regardless of whether we are
playing Wales, Canada, South Africa or New Zealand," Eales said.
"The main thing for me is being able to assess the general direction
the team is going and if things are going well to make sure they stay
that way."
Eales' is expected to give the goalkicking duties to fullback Matthew
Burke.
Australian team: Matthew Burke, David Campese, Joe Roff, Tim Horan,
Alastair Murdoch, Pat Howard, George Gregan; Daniel Manu, Owen Finegan,
David Wilson, Garrick Morgan, John Eales (captain), Ewen McKenzie,
Marco Caputo, Richard Harry. Reserves: Michael Foley, Dan Crowley,
Michael Brial, Sam Payne, Scott Bowen, Steve Larkham.
