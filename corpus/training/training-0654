Djibouti Port to Be Administrated by Dubai: Report 
Djibouti is to hand over the entire port administration to the Port of
Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, local Capital weekly reported Sunday.
Negotiations over the matter have been going on for about two months
between officials from the two ports.
A 20-year lease agreement is about to be signed in the coming three
weeks, an unidentified source was quoted as saying.
Djibouti chose the Port of Dubai for its good reputations and excellent
record in port administration.
It was reported that Port of Dubai also administers, among others,
Saudi Arabia's Port of Jidda, Lebanon's Port of Beirut and one port in
Malaysia.
The Djiboutian government decided to give the business of its port to a
third party in order to efficiently handle the ever-increasing cargo
that is arriving at its port, the source said.
With Dubai taking over the management, efficiency at the Djibouti port
will be improved and new facilities will be available to increase the
volume of traffic, Djibouti port officials said.
Thus, there will be a good possibility for tariff to lower down, the
officials added.
In 1999, the Port of Djibouti handled four million tons of cargo, 70
percent of which was Ethiopia's import and export shipments.
