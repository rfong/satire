Singapore Oil Spill May Cost 100 Million Dollars 
Singapore's worst ever oil spill, resulting from the collision between
two tankers last Wednesday night, may cost about 100 million U.S.
dollars, local newspapers reported today.
The oil spill clean-up operations, the damage to vessels, Singapore
government claims and other claims can cost up to no more than 100
million dollars, the Business Times' Shipping Times quoted insurance
industry sources as saying.
The Thai-registered very large crude carrier Orapin Global and the
Cyprus-flagged Evoikos, which was carrying 120,000 tons of fuel oil,
collided in the Singapore Straits last Wednesday night.
An estimated total of 25,000 tons of oil from Evoikos was spilt into
the sea off southern Singapore after the collision, causing the worst
ever oil spill pollution in Singapore's history.
The Straits Times today quoted shipping sources as saying that human
error could have been the cause of the collision. The matter is still
being investigated and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore
(MPA) has not come up with its comment on the cause of the collision.
In the meantime, an MPA spokesman told the Shipping Times that is was
too early to assess the extent of the damage caused by the oil spill.
An MPA statement Sunday night said that the clean-up operation is still
continuing and has entered the next phase where the emphasis is on the
recovery of oil. A total of 45 anti-pollution craft have been deployed
for skimming, collecting oil from the sea and laying of booms.
