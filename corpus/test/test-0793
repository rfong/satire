Philippines Declares All-Out War Against Crimes 
Philippine President Joseph Estrada Wednesday declared an all-out war
against organized crime syndicates, warning drug lords that they will
be hunted to extinction during his administration.
Estrada, who is also the secretary of the Interior and Local
Governments, kicked off a nationwide campaign against organized crimes,
especially those drug-related ones, in San Juan city, Metro Manila.
An all-out war against criminality was one of the new president's
campaign commitments. He reaffirmed this promise in his inaugural
address at the Quirino Grandstand, Manila, Tuesday.
Estrada also appealed to the parents to give their "utmost cooperation"
in the fight against drugs and other forms of crimes.
