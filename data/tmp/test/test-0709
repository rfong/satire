Strong/JJ Chinese/JJ currency/NN eating/VBG away/RP at/IN trade/NN surplus/NN The/DT continuing/VBG appreciation/NN of/IN the/DT Chinese/JJ yuan/NN against/IN the/DT dollar/NN is/VBZ taking/VBG its/PRP$ toll/NN on/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS foreign/JJ trade/NN surplus/NN ,/, although/IN foreign/JJ currency/NN reserves/NNS remain/VBP at/IN a/DT record/NN high/NN ,/, a/DT report/NN said/VBD Sunday/NNP ./.

Since/IN the/DT unification/NN of/IN China/NNP 's/POS dual/JJ exchange/NN rate/NN system/NN at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN 1994/CD ,/, when/WRB the/DT yuan/NN was/VBD set/VBN at/IN 8.7/CD to/TO the/DT dollar/NN ,/, the/DT Chinese/JJ currency/NN has/VBZ appreciated/VBN steadily/RB --/: especially/RB following/VBG the/DT creation/NN of/IN an/DT inter-bank/JJ foreign/JJ exchange/NN market/NN in/IN April/NNP ./.

The/DT dollar/NN 's/POS weakness/NN saw/VBD the/DT yuan/NN trading/NN at/IN 8.44/CD at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN this/DT year/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT current/JJ swap/NN rate/NN is/VBZ averaging/VBG 8.3/CD yuan/NN ./.
