Flooding in Iceland after subglacial volcanic eruption 
A flood expected by expects following a month-long volcanic eruption
under Iceland's Vatnajoekull glacier started early Tuesday, threatening
bridges and roads in an uninhabited area east of the capital, experts
said.
Scientists the Icelandic Geothermic Institute who have been monitoring
the volcano said the melting water which has accumulated in the
Grimsvoetn lake was overflowing at some 7,000 cubic meters per second
towards the south of the glacier, threatening bridges and roads located
in the uninhabited area some 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of
Reykjavik.
The water was racing through tunnels under the glacier and across the
black volcanic sand towards the North Atlantic sea, volcanologist and
water expert Arni Snorrasson told Icelandic radio.
According to Snorrasson, the flow of water was increasing "at a pace
never before seen" and could reach up 40-50,000 cubic meters per
second.
Since the eruption began under Iceland's largest volcano a month ago,
some nine billion cubic meters of water have accumulated in the
Grimsvoetn lake under the glacier, which covers 10 percent of Iceland.
For weeks experts have expressed fears that the melting waters would
suddenly overflow violently and cause disastrous flooding.
Workers dug trenches in the national highway south of the glacier weeks
ago in preparation of the flood.
