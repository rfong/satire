NATO Agrees to Help Probe 1980 Italian Air Crash 
NATO has agreed to help Italy investigate a mysterious 1980 air crash
off the Sicilian coast in which 81 people died, local press reported
today.
Italian media have long speculated that the plane was accidentally shot
down by a NATO missile and the Italian government has repeatedly called
the military alliance to release secret radar charts relating to the
crash.
Prime Minister Romano Prodi Tuesday welcomed the decision of NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana to set up a committee to investigate
the crash and to study relevant radar charts, a government spokesman
said.
Investigating Judge Rosario Priore also hailed the decision, saying
that he was looking forward to unraveling the cause of the tragedy.
The accident happened on June 27, 1980, near the tiny island of Ustica,
some 60 kilometers north of Sicily, when an Itavia domestic airline
DC-9 crashed, killing 81 people aboard.
The committee, consisting of three NATO experts -- one legal, one
security and one military, is expected to meet Italian investigators
later this month, diplomatic sources said.
