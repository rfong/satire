Fed rate hike first since February 1995 
The decision Tuesday by the US Federal Reserve to raise the federal
funds rate a quarter of a point to 5.5 percent was the first
credit-tightening move by the central bank since February 1995.
The rate, a target figure used by banks making overnight loans among
themselves, is the US central bank's principal means of intervening on
short-term credit markets.
A change in fed funds is often followed by an adjustment in the prime
rate charged by banks to their best customers, a move that eventually
has an impact on a range of consumer credit charges.
The largely symbolic discount rate, charged by the Fed to banks that
borrow from it, was left unchanged at five percent.
The last time the Fed intervened to lower the fed funds rate was
January 31, 1996 in a move designed to spur consumption at a time of
flat growth.
The following is a summary of Fed moves on federal funds and the
discount rate since July 1990.
