China on Its Population Policy 
To address aging, China was placing a greater focus on the family and
social structure, China said here on Monday.
Addressing the thirty-second session of the Commission on Population
and Development, Chinese delegate Yang Kuifu said China's population
totaled 1.25 billion, of which 370 million were urban residents and 870
million were rural.
Thanks to 20 years of family planning efforts, the birth rate has
declined from 33.4 percent in 1970 to 16.3 percent in 1998, and the age
structure of China's population was in the process of rapid change, due
to decreased fertility rates in a short time, Yang said.
By the year 2000, the number of people aged 60 years and older would
reach 130 million, making up 10 percent of the total population, Yang
said.
With the coming of the new century, she said, China faced increased
population pressures resulting from its huge number of people and the
aging of its population.
The Chinese Government believed that the key solution lay in its
commitments to develop the economy vigorously, enhance its
comprehensive national strength, integrate its population programs into
its general strategy for development, and utilize its natural resources
rationally, Yang said.
To addressing aging, China was placing a greater focus on the family
and social structures, and in that regard, China had recently passed a
law on the protection of elderly rights, which would, among other
things, improve social security systems, Yang added.
