The New Enterprises: From Hamburgers To Condominiums
From consulting firms to car rental companies to boutiques and
restaurants like Ca-li-pho-nia Ham-bu-ga in Ho Chi Minh City, the
former Saigon, the enterprises of overseas Vietnamese are appearing on
the business scene in an increasingly hustling Vietnam.
There are no firm figures on the number of refugees who are returning
to stay, known as ``Viet kieu.'' But their businesses are a growing
part of an infusion of hard currency from Vietnamese in the United
States that the Hanoi government says totals more than $600 million a
year.
Some less affluent emigres bring a few thousand dollars to help their
families establish small enterprises like guest houses, tailor shops or
motorcycle repair shops. Wealthier individuals or groups are
negotiating to build hospitals or finance condominiums and beach
resorts.
The smaller enterprises mostly fly below the radar of government
interference and red tape. Like other ethnic Vietnamese, Ms. Ngo
benefits from family connections -- an aunt in this government office,
an in-law in that one -- that she said can at least help steer her
through the bureaucracy.
She also makes full use of family ties to address the mutual mistrust
that can make business negotiations here a delicate minuet. Suspicion
on the Vietnamese side has been furthered by foreign entrepreneurs who
have taken advantage of the Vietnamese's innocence in the marketplace.
In addition, an underclass of Vietnamese-American con men have engaged
in financial scams and bogus marriages that have made many local people
wary.
On the other side of the coin, foreign entrepreneurs face a morass of
vague and shifting investment laws and a business culture in which
local enterprises seem happy to sign exclusive contracts with more than
one foreign firm. And there are mixed feelings here toward the Viet
kieu, people who left their country at a time of hardship and returned
prosperous.
The New Arrivals: `I Do Not Know Where I Belong'
In addition to these uncertainties, returning Vietnamese can find
themselves uncomfortably suspended between two worlds.
Khuong Ho is a 31-year-old lawyer who came to the United States at the
age of 12, graduated from Yale and the University of Connecticut law
school, and now lives in Plainville, Conn. He has returned to Vietnam
``seven or eight times'' as a consultant on investment ventures.
``You feel like somehow magically you are able to go back to a time of
your youth, except that you are older and more mature and know what the
world is about,'' he said. He has revisited the villa his family was
forced to abandon in 1975 and made friends with its new occupant, the
former Communist mayor of Ho Chi Minh City.
Giang Tran, 30, the son of a parliamentary leader in the former South
Vietnamese government, fled the country by boat in 1979 but returned 10
years later because, he said, he was restless in America. Active in
business here, he has organized two Vietnamese trade fairs for American
companies, but said he still felt restless.
``I was in the United States a few weeks ago, and I have homes in
Saigon and Hanoi,'' he said, ``but I do not know where I belong.''
One of the more recent arrivals is Lan Vu, 27, the Vietnam
representative of the Sika Group, a Swiss chemical company. She, too,
said she found herself ``sort of caught in the middle'' between the two
cultures, learning to tread the narrow path between being an outsider
and a native.
``After 20 years in the States, well, I am American,'' said Ms. Vu, who
grew up in Portland, Ore. ``But the more time I spend here, the more I
love it and the more I feel at home. Probably intellectually I'm
American, but the emotional part of me is Vietnamese.''
But she added: ``I am very much a Northwest person. I can't wait to go
back and go skiing. I miss mountain biking. I miss the winter.''
In addition to young and hopeful returnees like Ms. Vu and Ms. Ngo,
there is another generation that has been returning for some time to
their homeland: elderly people who were unable to adapt to life in the
United States.
Among these are Ms. Ngo's maternal grandparents, who joined the family
in San Francisco in 1989 after a 10-year wait for visas, but stayed
just nine months before giving up. ``They returned to their village,
and they bought a new home,'' Ms. Ngo said, but they too remained
restless. ``They are home, but now they miss their children.''
Ms. Ngo's grandmother has fallen ill, and the older generation is
concerned that relatives from America be present for a proper Buddhist
funeral.
``Now my grandfather calls my mother every single week,'' Ms. Ngo said.
``He tells us to keep the telephone clear at a certain hour every day
in case grandmother passes away so someone could come quickly to pay
their respects at her funeral.''
