Australia, Thailand agree trade deal 
Australia and Thailand agreed Thursday to start work on a free trade
agreement.
The two countries have been holding preliminary talks for the last year
and the agreement was revealed by Prime Ministers John Howard and
Thaksin Shinawatra, on his first official visit to Australia.
"We have agreed to negotiate a closer economic relationship agreement
and I've described this, with the (Thai) prime minister's approval, as
a free-trade agreement-plus," Howard told a joint press conference with
Thaksin at Parliament House.
"If we can increase the trade volumes among the two countries it will
mean you have more investment, more employment, more economic activity
in each country," Thaksin said. "I think it will benefit both of us."
It would be Thailand's first bilateral free trade deal.
