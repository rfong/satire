Dhlakama's helicopter stoned 
Mozambican former rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama claimed he could
"paralyse the country in 24 hours" after his helicopter was stoned as
he left an election rally, the national radio reported Wednesday.
Dhlakama blamed the governing Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO)
party for the stoning after a gang of youths attacked his helicopter,
breaking a window on his side as he left the rally at Mogovalas in the
northern Nampula province late Tuesday.
Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) and
presidential candidate for October elections, said after the stoning
that he would not accept the outcome of the poll if he failed to win in
the provinces of Nampula, Zambezia and Inhambane.
According to the radio, reporting from Nampula, Dhlakama claimed that
President Joaquim Chissano's FRELIMO, generally held to be the
electoral frontrunner, had deliberately organised the stoning through
jealousy of RENAMOS's strong opposition in Nampula.
But the head of FRELIMO's elections campaign office, Mariano Matsinha,
denied that his party bore any responsability for the attack.
Dhlakama, who Wednesday continues his elections campaign in the Nampula
districts of Ilha de Mocambique, Monapo and Nacala port, has met with a
less than warm reception in some parts of the province, according to
reports on the state owned radio.
A rally he held Monday in the coastal town of Angoche was disrupted by
hecklers and he has apparently failed in Nampula to draw crowds such as
those which greeted his tour, last week, of central Zambezia Province.
