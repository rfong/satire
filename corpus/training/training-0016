A threat to shell a Canadian peacekeeping camp near Sarajevo passed
without incident Wednesday but Canadians still kept watch atop
observation posts for Serb army movements.
The Serb threat to shell the camp in Visoko within 48 hours passed by
mid-afternoon. The threat forced troops to adopt a high alert status,
filling sandbags, posting more look-outs and wearing flak jackets.
By dusk Wednesday, a cautious sense of relief spread through camp as
military data indicated no repeat of a Serb rocket attack on Sunday
which caused minor damage to a builing.
``It's still seen as a possibility but getting more remote by the
day,'' Capt. Tom Newton, a camp spokesman, said of the possible attack
in a telephone interview. ``There's little reported activity in the
camp area.''
Canadians monitor Serb army troop and vehicle movements around their
camp by several means, including radio reports from 55 Canadians being
detained by Serbs at observation points and other locations near
Visoko.
``People are uncomfortable with the whole idea of shelling obviously,
but they get used to the idea and get on with their job,'' said Newton,
30, a native of Victoria, B.C.
The camp was at the alert level of orange during daylight Wednesday and
was to stay at orange during the night. Orange requires personnel to
wear flak jackets outside. Non-essential trips outside camp are
cancelled.
The camp went to the highest level of red Monday night, forcing
personnel to sleep in bunkers and sea containers inside two camp
buildings.
About 400 Canadians remain in the Visoko camp at night. Since Monday,
100 non-essential personnel have slept in nearby Kiseljak. They return
to camp during the day.
Newton said there was no breakthrough Wednesday in negotiations to free
55 Canadians detained by Serbs at various sites near Visoko.
Things did not go well Wednesday for UN Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali who went to Sarajevo to work for a ceasefire and to
persuade Serbs to stop detaining 400 UN troops as insurance against
NATO airstrikes.
Serb leaders refused to meet him and the UN head was jeered by Sarajevo
residents while visiting the Muslim-led Bosnian government.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien spoke of the dilemma in an interview with
Paris daily Le Monde on Wednesday, saying, ``The peacekeepers in Bosnia
have become a sort of armed Red Cross, in a badly defined role.
``To be in Bosnia is difficult for us,'' Chretien said. ``It's a
European problem, and we are North Americans. The Americans want to
control everything, and fight down to the last Canadian and
Frenchman.''
Of the NATO nations, France has 4,354 men in Bosnia, the largest single
contingent. Canada has about 2,000.
In the Visoko area, Maj. Dean Milner, the senior officer among Canadian
detainees, makes daily contact with his soldiers and Serb commanders.
``Everything has been pretty cordial so far and they've (detained
Canadians) been treated fairly,'' said Newton, adding the 55 Canadians
are regularly supplied with goods.
Newton said the Serb threat has reduced peacekeeping efforts and
humanitarian aid in the area.
Soldiers also worry about the effect of media reports on Bosnia on
their families in Canada.
``Everybody in camp just wants to give a call home and let everybody
know they're OK,'' said Newton.
