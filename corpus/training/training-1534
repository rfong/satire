Fujitsu to speed up shift to 16 megabit DRAM chips: report 
Japan's computer giant Fujitsu Ltd. plans to speed up its production
shift to 16 megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips from 4
megabit DRAM chips, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Tuesday.
By the end of 1996, Fujitsu plans to double production of 16 megabit
DRAM chips to eight million units a month, from the current production
level of four million units, the newspaper said.
Fujitsu is currently producing eight million units of 4M DRAM chips
monthly, which it now plans to cut to six million chips a month by the
end of 1996, lower than its original planned production cut to 7.5
million, it said.
The company is also planning to boost output of synchronous chips and
other more specialised units, as it seeks to cut its dependence on mass
produced chips, it said.
