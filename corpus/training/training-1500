Vehicles Free to Travel in MERCOSUR Countries 
Starting from today, Argentine, Uruguayan and Paraguayan tourists who
cross the Brazilian border in their own automobiles are no longer
subject to border crossing formalities.
According to the new regulations signed Thursday by Brazilian Finance
Minister Pedro Malan, visitors from those countries will only have to
present theri car registration papers and identification proving their
residence.
The decision to facilitate tourist traffic among the Southern Cone
Common Market (MERCOSUR) member nations -- Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay
and Paraguay -- was made in December 1994 in Ouro Preto, Brazil.
The rule took effect on January 1, 1995, but border customs had not
received any official notification of the new rules which appeared
today in Brazil's "Official Gazette."
