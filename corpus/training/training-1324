Stores in this coastal community of Morehead City, which lies some 150
kilometers (90 miles) northeast of Wilmington, saw a run on bottled water,
but were planning on staying open beyond normal hours to accomodate last
minute needs. Afternoon traffic picked up as evacuation hit its final
stage.
Hurricane warnings were issued for the coastal regions starting at the
Virginia/North Carolina border and stretching south to the middle
portion of the Georgia coastline.
South Carolina Governor David Beasley Wednesday called for voluntary
evacuation of the islands and beaches south of Cape Romain which is in
the middle part of the state's coastline.
Further south along the coast in Savannah, Georgia, the Olympic
yachting venue was forced to evacuate Wednesday.
Further north, the US Navy ordered more than two dozen of its ships to
leave their base in Norfolk, Virginia, to dodge the storm, a Pentagon
spokesman said.
On Wednesday, up to one million people up and down the eastern seaboard
were asked to evacuate their homes, but once the storm veered north,
residents of Florida were able to return to their homes.
The storm has resulted in several deaths. In Puerto Rico, two men died
when they lost control of their car on rain-slicked roads and another
man drowned while surfing.
There were also unconfirmed radio reports that a fourth victim died
while surfing off the US Virgin Islands. Guadeloupe reported one dead
and one missing in the wake of the gale.
The Virgin Islands' St. Thomas -- still reeling from last September's
bashing from Hurricane Marilyn -- suffered mostly water damage, downed
trees and fallen power lines.
