Commission to investigate missionary deaths 
Sierra Leone's military government announced the creation of a
commission Friday to investigate the deaths of four European
missionaries killed in the West African country in March.
Irishman Father Felim McAllister and a Dutch doctor Ellco Krijn were
killed at Panguma, 240 kilometres (150 miles) east of the capital
Freetown on March 12. Krijn's wife Karina and daughter Zita, three,
were also killed at the Catholic hospital where the missionaries
worked, allegedly by members of the rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF).
The seven-strong commission headed by lawyer Solomon Berewa is to begin
its work Wednesday, the government said in a statement. Sierra Leone
Red Cross president Lloyd During is also a commission member.
No indication of how long the commission will take over its
investigation has been given.
McAllister had lived in Sierra Leone for 26 years, latterly working at
the Panguma mission where he helped people displaced by the RUF-led
rebellion, which broke out in May 1991.
The deaths followed those of two nurses working for the International
Committee of the Red Cross near Pujehun, 210 kilometres (130 miles)
southeast of Freetown, in August 1993. That attack was also attributed
to the RUF.
