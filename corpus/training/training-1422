Case Of Abandoned Chinese Boys Baffles Dutch Authorities 
Dutch officials Wednesday were investigating why two Chinese children
were apparently whisked from their homeland and abandoned in front of a
Dutch department store.
``We have no more information as to where they come from in China or
why they've come here,'' said police spokesman Rien van Kulk in this
southern Dutch city.
The two boys, believed to be nine and seven years old, apparently left
China only a few days ago and arrived in the country on Monday,
according to Van Kulk.
They speak with an accent common in mainland China, police said.
Speaking through an interpreter, the boys told police they had
travelled by plane, but it was not known at which airport in what
country they actually landed, or how they managed to pass immigration
check points.
They had no passports or visas in their possession and did not even
know what country they were in.
Police said the two boys, whose names have not been disclosed, claim
they left China travelling with a man who brought them to Breda and
abandoned them in front of a downtown department store.
The children said their parents are divorced and the man has been
taking care of them.
They said they all spent Monday night in a train station and the man
bought them new clothes Tuesday morning before he deserted them on the
sidewalk.
Left on their own, the two boys approached a woman parking her bike and
handed her a note with the word ``orphanage'' in Dutch.
Police also found another note on the children reading ``Goes Asylum
Center,'' the name of an asylum-seekers center located 60 kilometers
(37 miles) away.
``They looked well-dressed and healthy,'' Van Kulk said.
A Justice Ministry spokeswoman said officials were trying to determine
whether they would be allowed to stay in the Netherlands.
