Use of Drugs Drops in Costa Rica 
Drug use has been declining in Costa Rica in recent years, according to
a report released today.
The report was the result of a study made by the centers of detection
and treatment of addicts in the metropolitan zone of this capital, and
among persons who were treated in the emergency wards of the hospitals
of the country.
The study, conducted in all the Central American countries with a
similar methodology, determined that while in Costa Rica a drop in the
use of illicit drugs is observed, there is an increase in the rest of
the countries of the region.
