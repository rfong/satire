Opium-Substitute Crop Test Cultivation Successful
The test cultivation of flower wheat, an opium-substitute crop, in
Myanmar with the cooperation of Japan is showing success, said Myanmar
leader Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt.
The test cultivation of the crop on 81 hectares was part of the
country's plan to wipe out narcotic drugs, disclosed Khin Nyunt, First
Secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, when
meeting with regional authorities in Lashio, northern Shan state, on
Sunday.
"Harvesting time has now arrived and substitute crop cultivation will
be extended for regional progress and to eradicate narcotic drugs,"
added Khin Nyunt, who is also Chairman of the Work Committee for
Development of Border Areas and National Races.
Myanmar has worked out a plan for total elimination of narcotic drugs
within 15 years, initiating the move in 48 townships in the country
which cover those in Shan, Kachin, Kayah and Chin states after
successful transformation of eastern Shan state's Mongla region into an
opium-free zone in April 1997.
The country promulgated the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances
Law in 1993, followed by the formation of the Central Committee for
Drug Abuse Control, undertaking the implementation of drug control
projects, aimed at uplifting the living standard of border region
inhabitants and eradicating poppy cultivation.
According to official statistics, in the first six months of this year,
Myanmar seized a total of 4,927 kilograms of narcotics including 219 kg
heroin and 4,471 kg opium, destroying 15 heroin refineries and over
8,000 hectares of poppy plantations.
