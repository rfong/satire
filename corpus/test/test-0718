Rain changes game at Masters
Rain drenched Augusta National Golf Club here Saturday, providing a soaking
that should make the fabled course easier to handle in the third round of
the 61st Masters.
"This course will play easy," Masters leader Tiger Woods said. "You can
attack some of these pins. If you are anywhere near even par, you can
shoot two good numbers and win the tournament."
Woods, the 21-year-old prodigy bidding to become the youngest champion
in Masters history, fired the week's best round, a six-under par 66, to
grab a three-stroke lead midway through the year's first major event.
Woods was at eight-under par 136, three strokes ahead of Scotland's
Colin Montgomerie and four shots ahead of Italy's Costantino Rocca.
"Tiger is a great player," Rocca said. "If he stays like this, he is
number one and will win the tournament."
Rain will make conditions easier for balls struck onto the green to
stay in place, instead of rolling away from where they land as is often
case on the undulating puttings surfaces here.
"It will change the way the course is played," said Spain's Jose Maria
Olazabal, who shares fourth place at 141 with Americans Jeff Sluman and
Fred Couples. Paul Azinger, Paul Stankowski and Zimbabwe's Nick Price
are at 142.
"Greens are going to be wet and not so fast," Olazabal said. "There
will be low scores. The ball will hold."
The course played extremely hard in round one, with only seven of 86
starters breaking par. Officials made difficult placements of the holes
along the green expecting rain that never came.
The most significant rain story here in recent years was in 1992, when
third-round play had to be finished Sunday.
Couples won, in part because a tee shot on the 12th hole in the last
round stuck to wet grass on a bank above Rae's Creek instead of sliding
into the water. Couples saved a par and beat Ray Floyd by two strokes.
Woods has passed Spain's Seve Ballesteros as the youngest player to
ever lead a Masters round. Ballesteros was 23 in 1980 when he opened
with a 66 on his way to becoming the youngest Masters champion.
Woods, who never broke par in six rounds here as an amateur, could also
become only the second player in the 20th century to win his first
major as a professional.
Jerry Pate's 1976 US Open triumph was the only time the feat has been
achieved. Cary Middlecoff came the closest to turning the trick here,
finishing second in 1948.
