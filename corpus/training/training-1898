Ugly scrap over ECB top job could bruise euro
An ugly scrap for the top job at the European Central Bank could also
bruise the euro, but economists say the new chief is unlikely to be as
unpopular with the market as outgoing Wim Duisenberg.
Few tears were shed among currency dealers on Thursday after the
gaffe-prone Dutch banker said he would step down as president of the
ECB in July 2003, and the euro perked up to 0.8679 dollars from 0.8650
dollars shortly before.
A decision by the ECB to leave interest rates unchanged at 3.25 percent
shortly afterwards also drew a muted response.
In late trade, the European single currency was at 0.8679 dollars,
while the dollar fetched 133.74 yen.
Things could get more interesting for the market as contenders for a
replacement emerge from the wings.
Duisenberg's appointment and the birth of the ECB were marred by a
bitter row with France, which had at the last minute tried to push
through Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the French central bank, as an
alternative candidate.
Most bets are on Trichet to succeed Duisenberg. But Trichet has been
dogged by an investigation into his role in the near-collapse of the
previously state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais in the early 1990s, when he
was a finance ministry official.
"The risk is clearly that the Trichet investigation continues to run on
sufficiently long that effectively he's not in a position to take the
post next year anyway, in which case then it certainly starts raising
big questions as to who will take over," said Jeremy Hawkins, an
economist at Bank of America.
Other possible contenders include ECB vice president Christian Noyer,
who is to resign at the end of May, French Finance Minister Laurent
Fabius, Luxembourg's prime minister and finance minister Jean-Claude
Juncker and Belgian finance minister Didier Reynolds.
Jane Foley, an economist at Barclays Capital, said that any public
tussle over the presidency could hurt the standing of the ECB, saying
the euro-zone central banks "do need to build up their credibility."
She told AFP: "Duisenberg doesn't have the same weight as (US Federal
Reserve chief) Alan Greenspan or even Eddie George and the Bank of
England has, so anything that could be potentially negative to
credibility could potentially also be a euro-negative factor."
But Foley said the ECB would probably try to keep the negotiations out
of the public eye as much as possible.
Market watchers said that politics, not economics, would be the
overwhelming factor determsome degree of credibility in the
marketplace, but I think when it comes down to any kind of decision of
this nature politics tends to rule the day," said Hawkins.
Yet whoever lands the job would unlikely be less popular in the market
than Duisenberg. His verbal gaffes and the ECB's timid monetary policy
have been factors behind the euro's steady decline since its birth in
1999.
"Duisenberg isn't a particular favourite anyway so from that point of
view it's difficult to expect that the market's going to get very
disappointed that it's going to be someone else," said Foley.
Indeed, Duisenberg's offer that he could stay on as ECB chief for
longer if that would ease the handover could be the worst outcome from
the market's point of view.
"If he were to stay on longer, a) it would just be negative for the
markets in the sense that they don't like Duisenberg anyway, and b) I
suppose it would be negative in the sense that it suggests that they're
having real problems trying to find someone to replace him," said
Hawkins.
