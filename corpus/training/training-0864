Opposition Candidate Claims Victory in Costa Rica Election
Opposition presidential candidate Miguel Angel Rodriguez claimed victory
late Sunday in the presidential elections.
Early official results gave Rodriguez 47 percent of the votes cast
against 45 percent for ruling National Liberation Party candidate Jose
Miguel Corrales.
Corrales conceded defeat earlier Sunday and congratulated Rodriguez.
Rodriguez, head of the Social Christian Unity Party, declared to
thousands of his supporters, "The people have spoken, we have to listen
and follow their will."
