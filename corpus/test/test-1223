Banned Tongan flanker to stay in South Africa 
Tongan forward Feleti Mahoni, the first player sent off in the 1995
World Cup, will remain in South Africa despite being banned for the
rest of the tournament.
Mahoni, 22, making his World Cup debut, was sent off for "stomping" in
Tonga's opening pool D tie against France on Friday.
A disciplinary hearing upheld England referee Steve Lander's decision
to expell the flanker and suspended him for six weeks.
Mahoni was dismissed for stomping his boot into the face of backrow
forward Philippe Benetton, the French vice-captain, in the 67th minute
of the game.
But the Tongan camp said they were not convinced the right man had been
sent off, although they declined to appeal against the decision.
"We feel sorry for Mahoni," said Takitoa Taumoepeau, secretary of the
Tongan Rugby Football Union. "He was not the guilty party."
He hinted that one of the Tongan props was the man at the centre of the
incident close to the French 22-metre line when Benetton was trapped on
the ground on the Tongan side of a ruck.
But Lander immediately singled out Mahoni and ordered him off the
field.
France were leading 9-3 at the time and went on to win the game 38-10.
Taumoepeau said he saw "no reason" to send Mahoni back home, adding
that the player was welcome to remain in South Africa for the rest of
the tournament which ends on June 24.
He said the decision was taken partly out of consideration for Mahoni's
playing future, with a number of South African provinces apparently
interested in signing him.
"Yes, I've had a few managers speaking to me about Feleti, but I've
told them that if they're interested, they have to speak to the player.
I can't speak for him," said Taumoepeau.
Under new guidlines issued to World Cup referees, players guilty of
foul play are suspended for a recommended minimum of 30 days for
punching and 60 days for head-butting and unlawful use of the boot.
Mahoni's case was judged by independent disciplinary commissioner Roger
Vanderfield who was appointed by the tournament organisers, the Rugby
World Cup (RWC).
However, there was confusion in Venderfield's findings, which said
Mahoni had stomped on the French No 8. But Mark Cecillon, the No 8, had
left the field at the time of the incident and Benetton was wearing the
No 7 shirt.
RWC officials said they were certain there was no case of mistaken
identity about the offender while the victim was clearly Benetton, who
needed treatment to a damaged jawduring a lengthy stoppage after the
incident.
The 105kg, 1.89m Mahoni, capped 13 times, is the first Tongan to be
sent off in a recognised international and the fifth in World Cup
history. Two players were sent off in the inaugural event in 1987 and
two were sent off in the 1991 World Cup.
