Aid/NNP Convoys/NNPS Move/NNP Toward/IN Sarajevo/NNP Despite/IN Harassment/NNP Peacekeepers/NNPS struggled/VBD Wednesday/NNP with/IN the/DT grim/JJ reality/NN of/IN heavy/JJ fighting/NN and/CC Serb/NN limits/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ movement/NN as/IN frustrated/JJ NATO/NNP brass/NN pushed/VBN for/IN changes/NNS in/IN the/DT U.N./NNP Bosnia/NNP mission/NN ./.

NATO/NNP planning/VBG to/TO help/VB strengthen/VB ,/, or/CC alternately/RB ,/, to/TO end/VB the/DT 2/CD 1\/2-year-old/JJ mission/NN was/VBD likely/JJ to/TO bump/VB into/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS '/POS own/JJ reluctance/NN to/TO drastically/RB change/VB what/WP increasingly/RB appears/VBZ an/DT untenable/JJ mission/NN ./.

Two/CD U.N./NNP convoys/NNS rolled/VBD toward/IN Sarajevo/NNP to/TO distribute/VB humanitarian/JJ aid/NN ,/, a/DT basic/JJ aim/NN of/IN the/DT U.N./NNP mission/NN ./.

Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNP briefly/NN shut/VBD down/RP the/DT main/JJ route/NN into/IN the/DT Bosnian/NNP capital/NN Wednesday/NNP and/CC also/RB stopped/VBD the/DT convoys/NNS outside/IN the/DT city/NN for/IN inspection/NN ./.

But/CC officials/NNS hoped/VBD they/PRP would/MD arrive/VB at/IN the/DT Sarajevo/NNP airport/NN before/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ./.

Peter/NNP Kessler/NNP ,/, a/DT spokesman/NN for/IN the/DT U.N./NNP High/NNP Commissioner/NNP for/IN Refugees/NNP ,/, said/VBD two/CD convoys/NNS with/IN 239/CD tons/NNS of/IN food/NN were/VBD sent/VBN following/VBG one/CD that/WDT arrived/VBD Tuesday/NNP with/IN 111/CD tons/NNS of/IN aid/NN ./.

Land/NNP convoys/NNS are/VBP necessary/JJ because/IN Sarajevo/NNP 's/POS airlift/NN has/VBZ been/VBN suspended/VBN since/IN Nov./NNP 21/CD ./.

There/EX was/VBD more/RBR fighting/VBG just/RB southwest/JJ of/IN Sarajevo/NNP around/IN Mount/NNP Igman/NNP ,/, where/WRB Bosnian/NNP government/NN forces/NNS apparently/RB were/VBD trying/VBG to/TO threaten/VB a/DT Serb/NNP supply/NN route/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN far/RB western/JJ Bosnia/NN where/WRB Serbs/NNP were/VBD reportedly/RB counter-attacking/JJ against/IN advancing/VBG Croat/NNP forces/NNS ./.

In/IN northwest/NNP Bosnia/NNP ,/, where/WRB combined/VBN forces/NNS of/IN Serbs/NNP from/IN Croatia/NNP and/CC Bosnia/NNP and/CC renegade/NNP Muslims/NNPS are/VBP battling/VBG Muslim-led/JJ government/NN forces/NNS ,/, the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS reported/VBD heavy/JJ artillery/NN and/CC mortar/NN fire/NN around/IN the/DT town/NN of/IN Bihac/NNP ./.

Two/CD mortars/NNS hit/VBD the/DT center/NN of/IN Bihac/JJ town/NN ,/, a/DT U.N.-declared/JJ ``/`` safe/JJ area/NN ./. ''/''

One/CD mortar/NN hit/VBD a/DT house/NN ,/, killing/VBG one/CD person/NN and/CC wounding/VBG another/DT ,/, said/VBD U.N./NNP spokeswoman/NN Claire/NNP Grimes/NNP in/IN Zagreb/NNP ,/, Croatia/NNP ./.

Heavy/JJ fighting/NN was/VBD reported/VBN to/TO the/DT north/NN of/IN Bihac/NNP around/IN Velika/NNP Kladusa/NNP ,/, where/WRB attackers/NNS were/VBD trying/VBG to/TO seize/VB the/DT road/NN south/RB out/RP of/IN the/DT town/NN ,/, U.N./NNP reports/NNS said/VBD ./.

The/DT road/NN passes/VBZ near/IN a/DT logistics/NNS camp/NN of/IN a/DT beleaguered/VBN Bangladeshi/NNP battalion/NN ./.

On/IN Monday/NNP ,/, in/IN what/WP the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS termed/VBD a/DT deliberate/JJ attack/NN by/IN either/DT Croatian/NNP Serbs/NNPS or/CC renegade/NNP Muslims/NNP ,/, one/CD Bangladeshi/NNP was/VBD killed/VBN and/CC four/CD were/VBD wounded/VBN ./.

The/DT U.N./NNP command/NN in/IN Sarajevo/NNP turned/VBD down/RP a/DT request/NN by/IN the/DT local/JJ Bangladeshi/NNP commander/NN for/IN NATO/NNP air/NN support/NN during/IN the/DT Monday/NNP attack/NN ,/, in/IN an/DT illustration/NN of/IN the/DT limitations/NNS of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS mission/NN ./.

U.N./NNP officials/NNS cited/VBD poor/JJ visibility/NN and/CC the/DT danger/NN of/IN air/NN attacks/NNS in/IN a/DT built-up/JJ area/NN ./.

The/DT decision/NN also/RB led/VBD to/TO new/JJ tensions/NNS with/IN NATO/NNP officials/NNS ,/, who/WP expressed/VBD frustration/NN with/IN the/DT U.N./NNP command/NN 's/POS cautious/JJ approach/NN ./.

In/IN Brussels/NNP on/IN Wednesday/NNP ,/, NATO/NNP defense/NN ministers/NNS called/VBD an/DT emergency/NN meeting/NN of/IN top/JJ generals/NNS to/TO discuss/VB approaches/NNS to/TO toughening/VBG the/DT U.N./NNP response/NN in/IN Bosnia/NNP ./.

But/CC it/PRP was/VBD unclear/JJ that/IN they/PRP would/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO overcome/VB U.N./NNP resistance/NN to/TO a/DT tougher/JJR stance/NN ./.

The/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ,/, not/RB NATO/NNP ,/, has/VBZ control/NN over/IN the/DT mission/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT cautious/JJ approach/NN of/IN Japanese/JJ diplomat/NN Yasushi/NNP Akashi/NNP and/CC other/JJ top/JJ U.N./NNP officials/NNS in/IN former/JJ Yugoslavia/NNP have/VBP been/VBN a/DT consistent/JJ irritant/NN for/IN NATO/NNP ./.

NATO/NNP airstrikes/NNS were/VBD called/VBN in/IN three/CD times/NNS three/CD weeks/NNS ago/RB against/IN Serb/NN targets/NNS in/IN the/DT Bihac/NNP area/NN ./.

They/PRP did/VBD nothing/NN to/TO stop/VB the/DT Serbs/NNPS ,/, and/CC led/VBD them/PRP to/TO vastly/RB increase/VB pressure/NN on/IN the/DT U.N./NNP mission/NN ./.

They/PRP detained/VBD hundreds/NNS of/IN peacekeepers/NNS and/CC denied/VBD freedom/NN of/IN movement/NN to/TO U.N./NNP operations/NNS ./.

Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNP said/VBD they/PRP would/MD not/RB let/VB up/RP until/IN there/EX was/VBD no/DT more/JJR threat/NN of/IN airstrikes/NNS ./.

The/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNP have/VBP eased/VBN the/DT pressure/NN slightly/RB in/IN the/DT past/JJ week/NN ,/, freeing/VBG most/JJS of/IN the/DT peacekeepers/NNS and/CC allowing/VBG movement/NN of/IN some/DT convoys/NNS ./.

That/DT apparently/RB is/VBZ a/DT reflection/NN of/IN a/DT desire/NN not/RB to/TO pressure/VB the/DT U.N./NNP mission/NN so/RB hard/JJ as/IN to/TO make/VB a/DT withdrawal/NN likely/JJ ./.

Akashi/NNP met/VBD Wednesday/NNP with/IN Bosnian/NNP Serb/NNP leader/NN Radovan/NNP Karadzic/NNP in/IN his/PRP$ headquarters/NN in/IN Pale/NNP ,/, just/RB outside/JJ Sarajevo/NNP ,/, on/IN Wednesday/NNP ./.
