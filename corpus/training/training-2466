Croatian premier says IMF approves three-year deal with Croatia 
Croatian Prime Minister Zlatko Matesa said Thursday that the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) had approved a three-year deal with
Croatia, Hina news agency reported.
No figures were given, but an IMF delegation which visited Zagreb in
December said that if the Croatian government's three-year programme
were approved, it could free up to 500 million dollars in loans.
At a government meeting, Matesa announced that the national bank
governor had been informed that the fund's executive committee had
approved a three year deal with Croatia, Hina reported.
It quoted the prime minister as saying that the agreement was "very
important."
Robert Feldman, the head of the IMF delegation, said in December that
he would recommend that the Croatian government's programme for
1997-1999 be accepted by the executive committee.
He said that the loans would be contingent on Croatia meeting the
agreed targets set out in the programme, which foresaw real economic
growth of five percent and inflation of between three and four percent
per annum.
Feldman also called for significant progress on privatisation and for
the banking sector to be restructured.
