Milan: a tale of two cities 
The contrasting fortunes of Milan's two teams were highlighted in
Italy's Serie A at the weekend. AC Milan surged to a comfortable three
point lead at the top when they hammered Sampdoria 3-0 -- but
neighbouring Inter Milan slumped to a 4-1 defeat at struggling Bari.
Christian Panucci, Montenegran Dejan Savicevic and World Cup star
Roberto Baggio got on the scoresheet in AC Milan's impressive win while
Inter suffered their worst defeat since Englishman Roy Hodgson took
over late last year.
Bari scored three of their goals in the last quarter-of-an-hour, while
Igor Protti, who scored twice, is the league's top-scorer this season
with 12 goals.
Fiorentina, who started the day just one point adrift of AC Milan, and
third-placed Parma could only draw.
Fiorentina produced a spirited fightback to force a 2-2 draw at AS Roma
while Parma were held 2-2 at Torino.
Argentina's frontrunner Abel Balbo scored twice for Roma -- first from
a freekick and then close in from a goalmouth scramble -- but Anselmo
Robbiati's freekick and a header from Balbo's compatriot Gabriel
Batistuta brought the visitors level.
Dino Baggia and Argentinian Nestor Sensini were on target for Parma in
their 2-2 draw at Torino.
Juventus remained six points behind the leaders after Fabrizio
Ravanelli hit a second-half penalty in a 1-0 win at Atalanta,
