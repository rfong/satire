Polls open in key Mexican state vote 
Voting in the key state of Jalisco opened Sunday with the polls showing
the opposition could hand the ruling party the biggest defeat in its 66
years in power.
Ten parties are fielding candidates for governor of this west-central
state, home to Mexico's second-largest city, Guadalajara, but the
contest is between the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the
National Action Party (PAN).
The PRI candidate is Senator Eugenio Ruiz, a 47-year-old lawyer, while
PAN's candidate is Alberto Cardenas, 36, an industrial engineer.
The state's some three million voters will also be seating local
deputies and 124 mayors in the vote monitored by 4,000 national
observers.
Some of the latest public opinion surveys -- which generally are
inaccurate here -- have PAN beating out the PRI while others are giving
the ruling party the edge, but all show the two parties running
neck-and-neck.
In the August presidential elections, PAN won in many of the larger
cities -- including the capital Guadalajara -- but the PRI carried the
state by just under 45,000 votes.
Should PAN win this round, it will be the fourth governorship the PRI
has lost in the past five years. Until 1990, the PRI had not lost an
election.
