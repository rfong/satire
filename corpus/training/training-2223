Donors' conference for Macedonia set for March 12 
The European Union announced Monday that a long-awaited donors'
conference for cash-strapped Macedonia would take place on March 12,
following the approval of a crucial law on regional authority.
EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels said the passing of the law by
the Skopje parliament on Thursday represented the willingness of the
country's main political parties to implement a peace deal signed last
year.
In a statement, the ministers called on all ethnic communities in
Macedonia to continue to work for peace, and to refrain from any
actions that could threaten the country's stability.
The law strengthens the powers of regional and local authorities, and
was seen as a key part of a Western-backed peace accord signed in
August to end a half-year insurgency by ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
The country's four main political parties -- two Macedonian and two
ethnic Albanian -- agreed on Tuesday on a compromise text of the bill
to end a two-month political stalemate holding up its adoption by the
assembly.
The deadlock had delayed the convening of the donors' conference needed
to provide vital funds to help rebuild the struggling Balkan country
after last year's conflict.
The European Commission and the World Bank will organize the donors'
conference, according to a statement from the EU ministers.
