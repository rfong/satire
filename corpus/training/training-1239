Stranded Foreign Ship Brought to Indian Port 
A stranded foreign ship loaded with 2,800 tons of fuel oil was towed by
an Indian coast guard ship to the harbor of Chennai in southern India
Thursday morning, official sources said here.
The ship, registered in Dubai, was found adrift since June 12. It was
operating between Singapore and Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu, when it
started drifting.
The ship had reportedly developed engine troubles and propulsion and
power failure problems. It had also suffered a leak and water had
entered the engine room, the sources said.
Strong winds and rough sea hampered the towing operation and it took
three days to bring the ship to Chennai harbor.
