Pentagon/NNP Shortens/NNP Base-Closing/NNP List/NN Due/JJ to/TO High/JJ Initial/JJ Costs/NNS The/DT Pentagon/NNP 's/POS list/NN of/IN U.S./NNP military/JJ bases/NNS to/TO be/VB closed/VBN is/VBZ shorter/JJR than/IN it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN due/JJ to/TO pressure/VB to/TO minimize/VB high/JJ up-front/JJ costs/NNS ,/, Defense/NNP Secretary/NNP William/NNP Perry/NNP said/VBD Monday/NNP ./.

A/DT senior/JJ Republican/JJ lawmaker/NN said/VBD the/DT list/NN is/VBZ too/RB short/JJ ./.

The/DT Clinton/NNP administration/NN ,/, making/VBG final/JJ preparations/NNS for/IN issuing/VBG the/DT list/NN on/IN Tuesday/NNP ,/, ran/VBD into/IN the/DT iron/NN logic/NN of/IN base/NN closings/NNS :/: The/DT savings/NNS come/VBP years/NNS down/RB the/DT road/NN ;/: in/IN the/DT short/JJ term/NN ,/, closing/NN bases/NNS costs/VBZ money/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT heavy/JJ price/NN we/PRP are/VBP paying/VBG ,/, ''/'' Perry/NNP said/VBD during/IN a/DT question-and-answer/JJ session/NN at/IN an/DT American/NNP Legion/NNP meeting/NN in/IN Washington/NNP on/IN Monday/NNP ./.

``/`` The/DT good/JJ news/NN is/VBZ that/IN by/IN 1999/CD ,/, we/PRP will/MD be/VB saving/VBG dlrs/NNS 4/CD billion/CD not/RB only/RB that/DT year/NN but/CC every/DT year/NN thereafter/RB as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN closures/NNS ./. ''/''

But/CC Rep./NNP John/NNP Boehner/NNP ,/, the/DT third-ranking/JJ member/NN of/IN the/DT Republican/JJ majority/NN in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP House/NNP of/IN Representatives/NNPS ,/, said/VBD the/DT administration/NN apparently/RB is/VBZ satisfied/JJ to/TO keep/VB more/JJR military/JJ overhead/NN than/IN it/PRP needs/VBZ ./.

``/`` We/PRP still/RB have/VBP a/DT tremendous/JJ number/NN of/IN bases/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ country/NN that/WDT are/VBP no/RB longer/RBR necessary/JJ or/CC needed/VBN for/IN national/JJ security/NN ,/, ''/'' Boehner/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` As/IN painful/JJ as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ for/IN the/DT communities/NNS in/IN which/WDT those/DT bases/NNS are/VBP located/JJ ,/, we/PRP ought/MD to/TO bite/VB the/DT bullet/NN ./. ''/''

After/IN an/DT initial/JJ round/NN of/IN closures/NNS in/IN 1988/CD ,/, a/DT base-closure/JJ law/NN drafted/VBN by/IN the/DT current/JJ House/NNP majority/NN leader/NN ,/, Rep./NNP Dick/NNP Armey/NNP ,/, led/VBD to/TO closure/NN rounds/NNS in/IN 1991/CD ,/, 1993/CD and/CC this/DT year/NN ./.

The/DT law/NN has/VBZ no/DT provision/NN for/IN further/JJ rounds/NNS ./.

``/`` We/PRP ought/MD to/TO look/VB toward/IN extending/VBG it/PRP ,/, ''/'' Boehner/NNP said/VBD ./.

Perry/NNP has/VBZ said/VBD he/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO close/VB more/JJR bases/NNS in/IN 1997/CD but/CC thinks/VBZ Congress/NNP would/MD oppose/VB the/DT idea/NN ./.

The/DT fiscal/JJ 1996/CD defense/NN budget/NN includes/VBZ dlrs/VBZ 4/CD billion/CD for/IN previously/RB ordered/JJ base/NN closings/NNS ./.

Perry/NNP said/VBD he/PRP told/VBD the/DT service/NN chiefs/NNS to/TO consider/VB the/DT high/JJ cost/NN of/IN closing/NN bases/NNS in/IN making/VBG new/JJ recommendations/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PRP told/VBD them/PRP to/TO put/VB a/DT much/RB greater/JJR emphasis/NN on/IN reducing/VBG up-front/JJ costs/NNS and/CC getting/VBG a/DT faster/JJR return/NN ''/'' on/IN the/DT investment/NN ,/, Perry/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` That/DT has/VBZ influenced/VBN the/DT bases/NNS they/PRP have/VBP selected/VBN ''/'' for/IN closure/NN or/CC realignment/NN ./.

Information/NNP filtering/VBG out/RP of/IN the/DT Pentagon/NNP to/TO federal/JJ ,/, state/NN ,/, and/CC local/JJ officials/NNS indicates/VBZ that/IN this/DT year/NN 's/POS may/MD be/VB the/DT shortest/JJS closure/NN list/NN yet/RB ./.

Pentagon/NNP recommendations/NNS must/MD be/VB approved/VBN by/IN an/DT independent/JJ Defense/NNP Base/NNP Closure/NNP and/CC Realignment/NNP Commission/NNP ,/, then/RB accepted/VBN or/CC rejected/VBN in/IN their/PRP$ entirety/NN by/IN Congress/NNP and/CC the/DT president/NN ./.

Under/IN current/JJ Pentagon/NNP plans/NNS ,/, the/DT military/NN will/MD shed/VB 21,000/CD uniformed/JJ and/CC 30,000/CD civilian/JJ jobs/NNS in/IN fiscal/JJ 1996/CD ,/, which/WDT begins/VBZ next/JJ Oct./NNP 1/CD ,/, bringing/VBG the/DT force/NN to/TO 1.46/CD million/CD in/IN uniform/NN and/CC 799,000/CD civilian/JJ positions/NNS ./.

Those/DT levels/NNS will/MD decline/VB slightly/RB through/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT century/NN ./.

Bases/NNS approved/VBN for/IN closure/NN this/DT year/NN would/MD likely/RB take/VB several/JJ years/NNS to/TO finally/RB shut/VB down/RP ./.
