Rosario Ames, the wife of convicted CIA spy Aldrich Ames, was sentenced
Friday to 63 months in prison for her role in the case.
She was sentenced at the end of a 25-minute hearing in a federal court
here during which she begged for leniency in consideration of her young
son.
Aldrich Ames was convicted of spying for the Russians while holding
down a top job with the Central Intelligence Agency and is serving a
life sentence in jail.
