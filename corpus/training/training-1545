S. African Farmers Seek To Live Elsewhere 
Thousands of South African farmers and entrepreneurs are seeking to
establish independent commercial agricultural economies in other
southern African countries, +The Citizen+ daily reported here today.
The daily quoted South African President of Transvaal Agricultural
Union Dries Bruwer as saying on Thursday that the resettlement of
farmers to at least three southern African countries could start soon.
Agreements to ensure South African farmers' international status are
nearly finalised with relative countries, the official said.
The resettlement of South African farmers in other southern African
countries is part of the region's development project, which aims to
stabilise the regional economies.
Bruwer said the project would not only give South African farmers a
bigger living space, but offer an opportunity for them to farm at a
lower cost.
The economy inside South Africa +is such that many farmers are no
longer able to maintain their economic independence+ and +a large
number of farmers will become jobless over the next few years,+ the
official said.
By assisting other countries in the region to stabilise their
economies, south africa may also find a way to stem the flow of illegal
immigrants, according to the official.
It is estimated that some 12 million illegal immigrants are residing in
South Africa, with an influx rate of 300,000 a month sometimes.
