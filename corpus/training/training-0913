US Vice President Al Gore to visit South Korea March 28 
US Vice President Al Gore will pay a two-day visit to Seoul from March
28 to discuss latest developments on the Korean peninsula, the foreign
ministry said Tuesday.
In talks with South Korean President Kim Young-Sam and Prime Minister
Koh Kun, Gore is expected to discuss the security and political
situation as well as bilateral cooperation, a ministry spokesman said.
The visit will follow trips to China and Japan, and comes as the US and
North Korea are moving ahead rapidly on bilateral issues such as the
exchange of liaison offices in one another's capital.
Seoul and Washington are awaiting a decision from North Korea on
whether it will be drawn into proposed four-party talks to work out a
permanent peace regime on the peninsula.
North Korea, which is suffering massive food and fuel shortages for the
third straight year, attended a briefing in New York March 5 on the
talks proposal.
Washington and China which fought on different sides of the 1950-53
Korean War would act in a support role in the talks.
