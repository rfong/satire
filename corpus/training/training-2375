Entry Visa for Cambodia Required 
The Cambodian government has required all foreign travelers except
those holding valid passports of the countries or territories that have
visa exemption agreements with Cambodia to apply for entry visa prior
to their departure to the country.
A spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government
said the Cambodian government had notified the Immigration Department
of Hong Kong of the requirement, which will be effective from May 15.
As Hong Kong has not entered into any visa exemption agreements with
Cambodia, Hong Kong residents will need to obtain a visa from the
Cambodian Consulate in Hong Kong before their departure to Cambodia,
the spokesman said.
Previously, foreign travelers to Cambodia can obtain entry visa upon
arrival at the Pochengtong International Airport.
Appropriate entry visas can be obtained at the nearest Cambodian
embassies or consulates.
