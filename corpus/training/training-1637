Kenyans Urged to Make United Efforts for Economic 
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi Saturday predicted an economically
difficult new year for Kenyans when the nation marked its 35th year of
independence.
Despite "remarkable progress" made in 1998, "Kenya's economy will
continue to experience difficulties in the coming year," Moi told
thousands of Kenyans at the end of a grand celebration in Nyayo
Stadium, Nairobi.
"The damage to our roads caused by the El Nino rains have been a major
setback to the growth of our economy," said Moi.
Due to government efforts, he said, interest rates have declined to
their lowest level in three years, the governmental deficit is on a
downward course and the unrest caused by general elections held at the
end of 1997 are now settling down.
However, "economic recovery is a slow and painstaking process," he
noted, adding that his government will continue with its tight policies
to control public spendings and transit cargo, crack down on cheap
imports and improve revenue collection.
"It is through the joint effort of all Kenyans that we will succeed in
building a strong economy, create more job opportunities for our people
and reduce the painful effects of poverty in our society," he stressed.
The major attraction of the celebration was demonstration flights by
Kenyan air force, traditional dances and choir performances at the
Nyayo National Stadium.
