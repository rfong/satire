Leaders Sum up Results of Mideast Summit in Egypt 
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said here Tuesday the emergency
Middle East summit achieved significant agreement on security, renewing
the peace process and on fact-finding.
Israeli and Palestinian leaders have stepped back from the abyss and
renewed their commitment to resolve their differences by peaceful
means, said the U.N. chief at the closing session of the summit, which
opened here Monday.
"It has not been easy. Feelings run high on both sides. Mutual mistrust
is deep," Annan said.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton, in his statement at the end of
the summit, hailed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat for reaching a deal to end the 20 days of bloody
clashes and revive the faltering peace process.
"The greatest credit for the progress we have made today belongs to
Prime Minister Barak and (Palestinian National Authority) Chairman
Arafat," Clinton said. "We all recognize that theirs was the primary
decision made."
Clinton left this Red Sea resort immediately after announcing the
agreement to attend a memorial service in Virginia on Wednesday for the
sailors, who died in a blast on a U.S. destroyer last week in Yemen.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whose country hosted the summit, said
the meeting had fallen short of the hopes of the region's people, and
warned a ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Palestinians could
be fragile.
He said at the closing ceremony that "In the coming days our peoples
will watch the degree of commitment by the two parties to implement
what has been agreed."
In an interview with two Israeli television stations after Clinton
announced the agreement, Barak said that Israel had achieved its
objectives at the summit, including preventing an international probe
into 20 days of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
"We have achieved our objectives during this summit: an effort to halt
the violence of recent weeks and preventing the creation of an
international commission of inquiry," he said.
Meanwhile, Barak said that the implementation of the ceasefire
agreement with the Palestinians would determine whether Arafat was a
partner for peace.
"The test will lie in the implementation," he added.
The prime minster also said he was still aiming for the creation of an
emergency government with the right-wing opposition after reaching such
a deal with the Palestinians at the summit to end the cycle of violence
in the region.
There was no immediate response from Arafat, who has left here for home
in Gaza.
