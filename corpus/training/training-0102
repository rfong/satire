Prominent human rights activist arrested 
Leading Nigerian human rights activist Beko Ransome-Kuti was arrested
here Wednesday at his residence by security agents, the Committee for
the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) said.
Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the Campaign for Democracy (CD), the umbrella
organisation for about 40 human rights bodies, was picked up by
plain-clothed security men and driven to his residence, the CDHR said.
Ransome-Kuti is also president of the CDHR.
The security men searched his room and then arrested him, taking him to
the headquarters of the the Federal Intelligence and Investigation
Bureau (FIIB), the CDHR said.
He was accused of receiving six million naira (273,000 dollars) from
Chief Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last year's June 12
presidential election, to "bomb government installations and strategic
buildings", according to the CDHR statement.
Ransome-Kuti spent a week in jail in September but was granted bail on
September 21 by a magistrates' court here.
He was then accused of having sent threatening letters to the directors
of two oil companies -- Agip of Nigeria and the Shell Petroleum
Development Company -- obliging them to participate in an oil strike
which crippled business in July and August.
Ransome-Kuti has been outspoken in his support of Abiola, a millionaire
Moslem businessman arrested on June 23 after he proclaimed himself
president to mark the first anniversary of the poll annulled by the
military regime last year.
