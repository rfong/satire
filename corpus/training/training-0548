Khatami to Address U.N. General Assembly on Dialogue of Civilizations 
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami will voice his country's view on a
plan of action for dialogue among civilizations at the U.N. General
Assembly special meeting, scheduled for November 8-10 in New York,
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi announced Monday.
On Khatami's initiative, the U.N. General Assembly, in 1998, designated
the year 2001 as the year of dialogue among civilizations , Asefi said,
quoted by the official IRNA news agency.
Iran has worked with the international community to prepare for the
approval of an action plan to go ahead with dialogue of civilizations
through the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Asefi added.
The OIC has reportedly provided a draft action plan for dialogue among
civilizations in specialized meetings in Iran's Capital of Tehran, the
Saudi city of Jeddah, and New York.
The draft action plan has been offered for discussion among the U.N.
member states and will be delivered to the U.N. General Assembly
special meeting for approval.
"Since President Khatami put forward the initiative of dialogue among
civilizations, the international community has taken major steps toward
understanding among diverse civilizations and realized that the world
is in dire need of dialogue to help solve the international crises,"
Asefi noted.
"Iran believes that human beings in the 21st century should make every
endeavor to promote dialogue to foster the peaceful means for the
international crises," Asefi said, stressing that Iran regards dialogue
among civilizations as the key to human dignity and an invaluable
heritage for generations to come.
