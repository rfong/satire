Panama, Colombia Intensify Border Vigilance 
Panama and Colombia have in the past few weeks intensified vigilance on
their respective borders, check points and airports to prevent drug
traffickers from diverting chemicals that are used for refining drugs.
Panamanian and Colombian authorities believe that several groups of
drug dealers are studying how to install laboratories in remote places
in Panama since the Colombian police have dealt harsh blows to their
cartels with the dismantling of production centers in that country.
The vigilance includes measures to control all international
transactions with those kinds of substances and detailed reports by
individuals and companies in both countries on all transactions of that
nature.
This confidential information is exchanged between the two countries to
allow follow-up of the shipments of the substances that enter and leave
their borders.
In 1993 Panama and Colombia signed an agreement to prevent the
diversion of chemical ingredients and basic substances needed for
refining narcotic drugs.
Under the agreement, the authorities of both countries may carry out
joint operations, even on the high seas, to confiscate illegal
shipments.
