Resuming at his overnight score of 61, the little maestro raced to his
century in grand style -- moving from 83 to 99 runs with a flurry of
boundaries against Kim Benjamin.
Tendulkar then hooked West Indian skipper Courtney Walsh over the
square leg fence for a huge six.
It was his first Test hundred against the West Indians in only his
second match against them. Tendulkar slammed a match-winning 85 in the
first Test at Bombay.
The boy wonder's seven previous centuries include two against
Australia, England and Sri Lanka and one against South Africa.
Azharuddin, who began his innings on Friday morning after night
watchman Venkatpathy Raju had fallen in the last over of the first day,
matched Tendulkar stroke for stroke during a spectacular assault on the
limited West Indies attack.
Azharuddin was unlucky to fall three runs short of his 15th Test
century when off-spinner Carl Hooper had him caught in the leg by
Simmons, midway through the post-lunch session.
Azharuddin's wicket was the first of three to fall within the space of
12 runs as India slipped from a commanding position of 432 for four to
444 for seven.
Hooper also had Sanjay Manjrekar caught by Simmons at leg slip for two
and returned the most successful bowler with figures of five for 116
from 40 overs.
Brian Lara ended Tendulkar's knock with a sensational catch at
mid-wicket 30 minutes before tea, diving to his right to hold a
one-handed catch inches above the ground.
But Kumble, who made 42 runs in the Bombay Test, once against showed
his batting skills by hitting four boundaries and two sixes off Hooper
to take India near the 550-run mark.
