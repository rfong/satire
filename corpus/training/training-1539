New Device Helps Recycle Oil Sewage
A new sewage treatment device developed by Chinese engineers in Baise Oil
Field, a low-permeable oil field in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, can help recycle the grease sewage for water used in oil
exploration.
Ge Yingwen, a senior engineer with the oil field, said that the device
enables no oil-contaminated sewage discharge, which is an important
advance in optimizing the ecological environment near oil fields with
low permeability.
One-third of China's oil fields are low-permeable, which need large
amounts of water infusion in the exploration. However, the film of oil
covered on the sewage is difficult to be separated and reused, which
has become a source of pollution. The device built on the theory of
proximity has won three national patents. It has been installed and
went into production in the oil field.
