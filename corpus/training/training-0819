Bob Hope honored on his 99th birthday 
US legendary entertainer Bob Hope received greetings and honor as he
celebrated his 99th birthday Wednesday.
Los Angeles County declared the day Bob Hope Day, with county
supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky noting that for nearly 60 years, Hope "has
lifted the spirits of America's armed forces and our greater
community."
A Los Angeles chapel was named after him, but the retired entertainer
was represented at the ceremony by his wife Dolores.
The United Service Organizations, a charitable group that entertains US
troops, also marked Hope's birthday because of his unwavering
commitment to the morale of US servicemen.
Hope has traveled the globe to entertain US troops for nearly six
decades.
Hope, who began his artistic career early last century by impersonating
Charlie Chaplin, was born in Britain on May 29, 1903.
He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998.
