Spanish giants Barcelona to play in Thailand 
Thai football fans will celebrate their own World Cup of sorts later
this month when they welcome Spain's FC Barcelona for an exhibition
match on May 29, authorities said Thursday.
Barca, the first Spanish team ever to visit Thailand, will arrive in
the capital on May 26 to take on Thai league team BEC TERO, an
occasional exhibition vehicle which is expected to be well-stocked with
national team members.
Thai Football Association vice president Thawatchai Sajakul said the
match would be an important test for Thailand's footballers, who are
considered Southeast Asian powers but have never reached the World Cup
finals.
"We hope Thai footballers will have a chance to play other Spanish
clubs after Barcelona as it will be a great experience for them,"
Thawatchai told a news conference.
Barcelona, who came away with no titles this season but have won 24
league championships, may be short of their normal stable of stars when
they visit Thailand as up to nine players could line-up for their
national squads at the World Cup.
The team will be led by "flying Dutchmen" Patrick Kluivert, Mark
Overmars, Frank De Boer and Phillip Cocu, officials here confirmed, as
Holland failed to make the 2002 finals.
English Premier League powerhouses Liverpool and Manchester United
played separate exhibition matches in Thailand last year.
The kingdom hosted four-time world champions Brazil in 2000, but the
South Americans backed out of a plan to train in Thailand ahead of this
year's World Cup, opting instead for neighbouring Malaysia.
