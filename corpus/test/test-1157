Jury hears of mixup in identifying Michael Jordan's slain father
Authorities investigating the 1993 disappearance of Michael Jordan's
father had inititally misidentified the elder Jordan's body, discovered
in a South Carolina swamp.
That information came during testimony in the second day of the trial
of Daniel Green, 22, who was arrested in August 1993 for robbing and
murdering James Jordan a month earlier.
Sheriff Charles Foley of Marlboro County, South Carolina, testified
Thursday that his men had initially identified the body pulled from Gum
Swamp as being that of Alphonso Green of Rowland, North Carolina.
Foley testified that Green had been reported missing at that time, but
the return of a medical examiner's report confirmed that the body was
indeed that of James Jordan.
Daniel Green's defense attorney quickly pounced on that testimony with
the hope of reviving their earlier argyument that James Jordan faked
his death to escape financial problems as well as some other personal
problems, which included two paternity suits.
Superior Court Judge Gregory Weeks appeared unable to accept to defense
assertion that the body may been that of Alphonso Green.
"Folks, isn't it a fact that Mr. Alphonso Green was subsequently
located," the judge said. "If the prosecution can produce Mr. Alphonso
Green alive and well in this courtroom then that may have a serious
effect on the credibility on counsel for the defendant in the minds of
these jurors."
"Mr Green is alive and well," prosecutor Johnson Britt said. "If we
have to bring him in here, and parade him around in front of the jury
to satisfy the defense, then we'll do that."
Britt reminded the judge and the jurors that fingerprints and the
dental work on the corpse pulled from the swamp matched perfectly with
dental and fingerprint records belonging to the late Mr. Jordan.
Daniel Green, 22, and his co-defendant Larry Demery, 22, are both
facing the death penalty.
Both were charged with first degree murder, armed robbery and
conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Demery pleaded guilty to those
charges in April and plans to testify against Green.
Sources with the defense and the prosecution say that a deal exists
that will allow Demery to escape a death sentence if he offers
testimony which leads to a conviction against Green for Jordan's
murder.
