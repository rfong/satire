Air New Zealand says it will defend its markets vigorously 
State owned Air New Zealand said Monday it will defend its markets
vigorously from any attack by Australian carrier Qantas.
Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon was quoted over the weekend on both
sides of the Tasman as giving an in-house speech saying his company
wanted to "put Air New Zealand out of business". The speech was said to
have targeted domestic air services in New Zealand.
Dixon has since denied making the speech.
In a statement Air New Zealand said threats from Qantas were not new.
"The only surprise this time is that they are actively seeking a
damaging and costly battle on two fronts -- with the imminent
introduction of additional competition from a revived Ansett in their
home market, and stronger competition offshore from a recapitalised Air
New Zealand," the statement said.
Air New Zealand has been preparing for more aggressive competition.
"Naturally, we arent going to signal our intentions -- but you can
expect to see us rolling out the results over the next few months....
"The company has also secured additional capital from its share sale to
the government.
"We have repaid all our unsecured borrowings. We had about 420 million
NZ dollars (174 million US) in the bank last Friday, and we have just
signed heads of agreement with a new banking consortium to obtain
significant new facilities."
