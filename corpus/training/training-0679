German magistrates charges Ankara covering heroin traffic 
A magistrate in Frankfurt accused the Turkish government on Tuesday of
covering up heroin trafficking with Germany.
Court president Rolf Schwalbe said it had been established that there
were close ties between the traffickers and the Turkish government.
Schwalbe made the charge at the close of the three-month trial of three
Turks who were sentenced to between five and nine years imprisonment
for smuggling eight kilograms of heroin from Istanbul to Frankfurt in
October 1995.
He said heroin traffic between Turkey and western Europe was controlled
by the Chenoglu and Baybaschin families of Istanbul, who were "covered"
by the Turkish government.
He said they both had "excellent relations with the Turkish government"
and "personal contacts with a minister in this government".
This fact had seriously complicated drug investigations, he said.
