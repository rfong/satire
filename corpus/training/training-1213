Opposition rejection of Zimbabwe poll irresponsible: minister 
Zimbabwe's information minister Jonathan Moyo said Thursday that the
opposition's rejection of longtime ruler Robert Mugabe's re-election in
the weekend's historic presidential election was "irresponsible".
"Being a democrat (is) accepting defeat," Moyo told state television.
Official ballot counts say Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) was beaten by Mugabe.
The official results gave the 78-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled
Zimbabwe since independence from Britain 22 years ago, 56.2 percent of
the vote to Tsvangirai's 41.9 percent.
Tsvangirai has rejected the results, saying the poll was "massively
rigged".
Moyo is the first member of Mugabe's government to give a public
reaction since Mugabe's poll victory was declared on Wednesday.
He said Tsvangirai's MDC "took their position in advance" of the
announcement of the results.
Moyo shrugged off conflicting reports from different election observer
missions. African observer teams generally said Mugabe's re-election in
the March 9-11 poll was acceptable, while monitors from the West and
the Commonwealth said the eMfsrion was seriously flawed.
The Commonwealth issued a report condemning widespread pre-election
violence, saying the ballot was held in a "climate of fear" and marred
by irregularities.
"Observation is not a science," Moyo said. "Europeans put Europeans
first, Americans put Americans first and Africans put Africans first."
"It's amazing how the international media, especially the British,
presented the Commonwealth report as an attack," he said. "It's a
preliminary report."
