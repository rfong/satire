Russian tanks head towards village held by Chechen hostage-takers 
A column of Russian tanks Thursday headed across eastern Chechnya bound
for the Dagestani border village of Pervomaiskaya where Chechen rebels
were holding about 100 hostages, Russian television reported.
Meanwhile up to 600 Chechen rebels massed in two villages a few
kilometres from Pervomaiskaya.
Russian television said the tanks left Russian-controlled Gudermes,
Chechnya's second largest town, where bitter fighting erupted in
December. It lies about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Pervomaiskaya.
Russian special forces and regular troops were already surrounding the
Chechen rebels who had taken up defensive positions in Pervomaiskaya.
A reporter for Radio Liberty said he saw up to 600 Chechen separatists
mass in the villages of Engel Yurt and Kadi Yurt on the Chechen side of
the border.
They were armed with grenade launchers and assault rifles and were
ready to intervene if Russian troops attacked the hostage-takers, the
reporter told AFP after spending the night in one of the villages.
Russian artillery also moved towards Pervomaiskaya from a camp set up
nearby and helicopter gunships flew overhead all morning.
It was not clear whether Russian forces had launched an assault on the
village, where about 150 rebels were holed up with their hostages.
General Alexander Mikhailov, a spokesman for the Russian Federal
Security Service (FSB), told AFP near the village that the rebels were
holding 66 civilian hostages and 37 policemen who were acting as
"volunteer" human shields.
The rebels, who stormed the Dagestani town of Kizlyar at dawn Tuesday,
arrived in Pervomaiskaya with the hostages on board nine buses.
They demanded a Russian troop withdrawal from Chechnya and safe passage
into Chechnya, which was stormed in December 1994 by Russian forces
aiming to crush an independence bid led by Dzhokhar Dudayev.
