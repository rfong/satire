Mbeki Stands for Regional Coop. in Curbing 
South Africa Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has said that an effective
way to curb increasing illegal immigrants in the country is to help its
neighbors to create more job opportunities.
Addressing a press conference in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga Province at the
weekend, Mbeki said that rather than deporting illegal immigrants,
South Africa should create projects to ensure that these countries were
economically viable to provide job opportunities for their own people.
Mbeki was referring to immigrants who continued to illegally cross the
border into South Africa from impoverished neighboring Mozambique and
Swaziland in search of jobs and better prospects.
Continuing to deport illegal immigrants from neighboring countries
would both be difficult and costly for South Africa, Mbeki said.
He cited the Maputo Development Corridor which has been developed
jointly by South Africa and Mozambique as a good example in providing
job opportunities to people in these area.
It is reported that there are more than three million illegal
immigrants from neighboring countries staying in South Africa.
