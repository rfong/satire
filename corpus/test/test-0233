Four More Teams Enter Champions League Quarter-finals 
Juventus, Real Madrid, Leverkusen and Monaco joined Borussia Dortmund,
Manchester United, Dynamo Kiev and Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals
of the European Champions Cup league quarter-finals on Wednesday.
Juventus scratched through to reach the premiere club competition
quarter-finals by edging Manchester United 1-0 through forward Filippo
Inzaghi in the dying minutes, after Olympiakos' late 2-2 draw with
Rosenborg in Greece.
Real Madrid got the quarter-final berth by trouncing the Portuguese
side Porto 4-0, Monaco held the host Bayer Leverkusen to a 2-2 draw,
which sent both into the quarter-finals.
Leverkusen went through as the group winner with a better goal
difference and Monaco survived as one of the two best second-placed
teams in the league.
Borussia Dortmund, the defending champions, beat Sparta Prague 3-0 to
storm into the final eight on a high note. Bayern Munich suffered an
embarrassing 1-0 loss to Goteborg and Dynamo Kiev had the same hard
luck to lose 2-0 to outsiders Newcastle.
Among the other encounters, Paris-Saint Germain was excluded out of the
final eight competitions for the first time since 1993 although the
French club downed Besiktas of Turkey 2-1.
Dutch club Feyenoord outlasted Kosice 1-0, Galatasay tied 1-1 with
Parma and Sporting Lisbon beat the visiting Belgian outfit Lierse 2-1.
All these clubs failed to win a chance to enter the quarter-finals.
The draw for the quarter-finals is set for December 17.
