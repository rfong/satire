Travel Between Canada, Other Countries Drops in May 
The number of overnight trips between Canada and other countries
dropped in May, Statistics Canada reported today.
In May, Canadians spent at least one night out of the country on almost
1.6 million occasions, down 2.8 percent from April.
Meanwhile, foreigners made 3.1 percent fewer trips to Canada compared
with April.
The number of foreign visitors to Canada has been on the rise since
mid-1992, the federal agency said.
In May, the number of trips of at least one night between Canada and
overseas countries (those other than the U.S.) fell by 6.4 percent in
both directions.
This was the largest drop in travel in both directions since February
1993 for overseas visitors to Canada and since December 1992 for
Canadians to overseas destinations.
Overseas visitors made 359,000 trips of one or more nights to Canada in
May, the lowest monthly level since February 1996.
May was the third consecutive month that Canada received fewer overseas
visitors, the agency said.
The weakening of many European currencies and the Japanese yen against
the Canadian dollar during the past year partly explained the drop of
overseas visitors to Canada.
