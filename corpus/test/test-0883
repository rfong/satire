Guangxi's "Blue Plan" Proven Beneficial 
South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has gone ahead
successfully with its "Blue Plan", which has raised gross output of its
maritime industry to more than 4.8 billion yuan.
Guangxi has a coastline of 1,595 km and offshore areas rich in
petroleum, natural gas, and aquatic resources with favorable
cultivating conditions.
However, the autonomous region's maritime industry was undeveloped
because of lack of technology. So, during the Eighth Five-year Plan
(1991-1995), especially the last two years, the regional government
worked out a series of preferential policies to improve the maritime
industry.
In 1994, the region's fishing, petroleum, maritime transportation,
salt, and tourism industries reported an income of 3.4 billion yuan,
one billion yuan, 228 million yuan, 34 million yuan and 103 million
yuan, respectively.
In Hepu county, on the Beibu Gulf, the maritime cultivation area was
more than 2,200 ha in the first half of this year, an increase of 23
percent over the same period of last year, and the rate of applied
technology reached 85 percent.
A maritime industry fair held in Beihai city last October attracted
businessmen from Japan, the United States, Singapore, Malaysia, and
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, with agreements for 48 projects with a
total investment of 619 million US dollars being signed in three days.
