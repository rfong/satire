French Captain Deschamps Questioned in Italy Doping Probe 
France's World Cup captain Didier Deschamps Tuesday was questioned by
an Italian magistrate investigating allegations of doping in Serie A.
Turin prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello inquired the French midfielder
for 90 minutes mainly about the allegations made by AS Roma coach
Zdenek Zeman that drug taking was rife in the Italian league and former
Juventus captain Gianluca Vialli and Juventus striker Alessandro Del
Piero developed their muscles in a dubious way.
Guariniello asked detailed questions about club training methods, to
which Deschamps replied "It's a way of working hard and seriously which
is at the root of our successes."
Deschamps has played four seasons at Juventus.
