Improved Sorghum Seed to Double Output
An new sorghum seed which is believed to double the present sorghum
yield has been developed in Ethiopia after a one-year research.
According to a report from the Ethiopian News Agency today, the
improved sorghum seed will help increase per-hectare production to four
tons from the present two tons.
The newly sorghum seed was developed by the Bako Agricultural Research
Center of Ethiopia.
Head of the center Shiferaw Tadesse told the press that the new seed is
disease-resistant, fast maturing and has good taste and strong stalks.
