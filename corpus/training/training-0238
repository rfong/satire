Iran, Britain Promote Diplomatic Relations 
Iran announced on Tuesday that Tehran and London had promoted their
diplomatic relations to ambassadorial level, putting an end to a
decade-long cool between them caused by the death verdict against
British writer Salman Rushdie.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told the Islamic
Republic News Agency that the decision came after the meeting between
foreign ministers of the two countries on the sidelines of the 53rd
session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last
September.
The two governments announced their approval of the appointment of
their present charge d'affaires as the future ambassadors.
Relations between the two countries were lowered down after the late
Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini issued a religious
verdict against Residue's life for alleged blasphemy against Islam in
his novel "the Satanic Verses."
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and his British counterparts
Robin Cook agreed to promote Tehran-London ties last September by
putting aside the Rushdie issue after Tehran promised that the Iranian
government would not send commandos to kill Rushdie.
The move was seen by European countries as Iran's withdrawal from its
former stance on Khomeini's verdict, but Tehran soon reiterated that
the death sentence on Rushdie is irrevocable.
