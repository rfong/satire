Berlusconi Sentenced to Jail 
Former Italian former premier Silvio Berlusconi was sentenced to two
years and four months in jail Monday for illegal party financing.
Berlusconi, 61, was also fined 10 billion lire (about 5.7 million U.S.
dollars).
The media magnate was alleged to have illegally channeled 22 billion
lire (12.5 million dollars) to ex-premier Bettino Craxi and his
Socialist Party.
Craxi was given a jail sentence of four years and a fine of 20 billion
lire during the same trial.
The verdict against Berlusconi Monday was the third conviction the
billionaire has received since last December 3, when he was given a
16-months suspended sentence for false accounting in the 1989 buy-out
of the Medusa film company.
On July 7, Berlusconi was sentenced to two years and nine months jail
for bribes paid to tax police by Fininvest, a holding company of
Berlusconi.
Despite these verdicts, Berlusconi, as a member of parliament, cannot
be jailed without parliamentary approval. The legal procedure to obtain
the approval could take several years.
Berlusconi was premier for seven months in 1994 and now heads the
opposition coalition, the Freedom Alliance.
