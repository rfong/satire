Saudi Guards Make Sure Only Muslims Enter Mecca
Only Muslims may enter this city, Islam's holiest place, and Saudi
guards stop every vehicle to make sure that nonbelievers don't slip
past.
But of course, some have. Drawn by curiosity or the lure of the
forbidden, a few Western non-Muslims are known to have disguised
themselves as worshipers to behold the birthplace of Islam.
A.J.B. Wavell, an intrepid English traveler, slipped into Mecca in this
manner in 1908. ``One feels instinctively that one is looking at
something unique: that there can be nothing else in the world the least
like it.''
The sights of Mecca still strike awe in the Muslim faithful, who are
obligated to visit the holy city once in their lifetime if they are
physically and financially able.
As they did in Wavell's day, and for centuries before, worshipers
dressed in seamless white robes walk a continuous circle around the
Kaaba, a stone monument draped in a rich, gold embroidered black silk
that is Islam's holiest shrine. Muslims believe it was built by Adam,
and later rebuilt by Abraham.
At seeing the Kaaba, Rakhman Akhmadov, an 80-year-old bricklayer from
Tajikistan, burst into tears and dropped to his knees.
``I saved up for half my life to see this moment, truly God is great,''
he cried.
Akhmadov is among the 2 million Muslims who have converged on Mecca for
the annual hajj pilgrimage, which culminates on Tuesday with a ritual
emulating the path followed by the Prophet Mohammed.
The faithful set off Monday for Mount Arafat several miles outside of
Mecca, forming a huge caravan and chanting ``At thy service O Lord, at
thy service.'' They will pray at the site at dawn Tuesday.
The pilgrimage historically has been a means of knitting together the
many races and nationalities that comprise the Muslim community. It
also provides a vast forum for learning and the exchange of ideas.
Even before the dawn of Islam, Mecca was an important stop for traders
of frankincense and myrrh.
Today, shopkeepers in the city's old covered marketplaces speak at
least a few words in more than a dozen languages and sell everything
from Iranian saffron to carpets from China.
