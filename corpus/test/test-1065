Portuguese-Speaking African Countries Embrace New Era
At the turn of the new millennium, the Portuguese-speaking African
countries (PALOP), arising from decades of devastating conflicts, are
struggling to make a difference.
The PALOP countries include Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde,
Guinea-Bissau and Sao Tome and Principe. Instability had long been an
insurmountable obstacle for any real development in these countries.
Fortunately, that depressive situation has become a past.
Angola, a synonym for battlefield since its independence in 1975, is
finally at end of its civil war. Since the latter half of 1999, the
government forces have won all major battles against the rebels of the
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), driving them out of
more than 92 percent of the country's territory. Although some
loyalists of the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi are stilling fighting in
some scattered mountainous areas, they are unlikely to stage a
comeback, after heavy defeat and with their access to the diamond mines
cut off.
Stability is also gaining ground in other PALOP states, including
Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, making it possible for the governments to
shift their attention to poverty alleviation, and economic recovery.
At the conclusion of the war, Angola, one of the most resourceful
African countries, is for the first time injecting more money from its
oil industry, diamond and gold mines to the battered economy, in stead
of paying for weapon bills.
In 1999, Angolan government led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
launched an ambitious economic readjustment program, geared to restrain
public expenses, increase transparency, and curb inflation. Though not
a magical cure for the country's long- delayed problems, these efforts
have paid off. Regaining confidence, international aid and private
investments are flowing in, making the southwest African nation the
third-largest investment destination on the continent. The output of
oil industry, pillar of its economy, is expected to raise from the
current 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) to over one million bpd in 2001,
which is almost certain to help for the country's economic recovery
under the circumstances of a high oil price on the world market.
Mozambique, with 7.5 percent average annual growth rate of the Gross
National Product (GNP) for the past five years, stood out on African
continent in term of speed of economic development. In the first half
of 2000, the total foreign direct investment in Mozambique reached an
impressive sum of 64 million U.S.dollars.
To turn the country into a processing base for semi-finished industrial
and agricultural products, and its capital Maputo into a major transit
harbor in African, Mozambican government has worked out and is
implementing its ambitious development schemes. Last month, President
Joaquim Chissano commissioned an 1.2-billion- dollar worth aluminum
smelter, the largest factory the Southern African nation has ever
built. The project, jointly invested by Mozambique government, South
African and Japanese businesses among others, is expected to double the
country's export volume and add about 7 percent to its GDP value.
In the same time, Cape Verde's dockyard, Guinea-Bissau's fishery and
Sao Tome and Principe's cocoa plantation have also registered
remarkable development these years.
A closer cooperation with other Portuguese-speaking countries,
especially with the more developed ones, also characterizes the PALOP
countries' economic recovery. It is in this light that the five PALOP
nations, along with Portugal and Brazil, established the Community of
the Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) in 1996. The organization has
proved to be contributive in encouraging investment flows among these
culturally linked countries. In the first half of 2000, Mozambique had
some 39 Portuguese projects with a total investment of 39.8 million
dollars, while Angola attracted some 35 Portuguese companies to set up
subsidiary companies in its central coastal province of Benguela in
February alone.
Besides the CPLP, the PALOP countries have also strengthened their ties
with other sub-regional organizations and their neighbors. In August,
Angola announced that it will join the free trade zone of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), the first one of this kind in
Africa. Mozambique, on the other hand, is quickening up its steps in
materializing the Maputo Corridor Program, which is made up of a
network of railways, highways and other means of transportation. The
project is aimed at making the best of its neighborhood with the more
developed South Africa to foster an economic growth belt in southern
Mozambique.
Given the piles of problems left by long period of wars and
mismanagement, it is impossible for the PALOP countries to score an
economic boom or even complete economic recovery in a short period of
time. But with the current momentum toward recovery and development,
and aided by persistent political and economic reforms, people may
safely say that a new era is downing upon these countries.
