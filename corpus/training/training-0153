Police see links in attacks on Turkish interests in southern Germany 
Three recent arson attacks on Turkish ultra-nationalist organizations
appear linked and may have been the work of Turkish extreme leftists,
the Baden-Wuerttemberg state criminal police said Thursday.
A fire destroyed premises of The Islamic Association of Turkish
Citizens in the town of Singen in the early hours of Thursday, leaving
a fireman slightly injured and causing several hundred thousand German
marks worth of damage.
On Monday night, a fire bomb thrown at a Turkish cultural centre in
Sindelfingen razed the building to the ground, without causing
casualties, while on July 30, an unknown assailant tossed a firebomb at
a Turkish cultural and sports organization in the southern town of
Horb, but firefighters put out the blaze before it could do much
damage.
Police said all three targets were ultra-nationalist organizations and
they believed the attackers may have been far-left Turks.
However they refused to rule out the possibility that the banned
Kurdistan Workers' Party, leading a Kurdish insurrection in Turkey, or
German rightwing extremists opposed to foreigners were responsible.
