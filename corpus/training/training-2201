New Nigeria Youth Soccer Team Formed 
Nigeria has named a new youth soccer team, replacing the one disbanded
Monday after a disappointing performance in the African Youth
Championship.
The new 30-player squad includes seven who are currently playing for
European clubs. The seven are members of the Under-17 youth team which
won the championship in that age group in Japan last year.
The previous national team was disbanded after it finished third in the
ninth African Youth Championship which ended on Sunday.
