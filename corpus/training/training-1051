Intelligence services crack coded letter 
Austrian intelligence services have succeeded in decoding a mysterious
letter warning of forthcoming terrorist acts, Interior Minister Caspar
Einem said Tuesday.
The 20-page letter -- 19 of which were in code -- was received on
September 30 by the Austrian weekly Profil.
It warned that eight public figures, including Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky, would be the target of letter-bomb attacks.
The letter was signed by an obscure organisation calling itself the
Bavarian Liberation Army, a tiny group which claimed previous attacks
during a wave of letter bombings that swept Austria between December
1993 and December 1995.
Austrian authorities appealed to U.S. decoding and electronic
surveillance experts last week to help break the code, which the Kurier
newspaper said was based on eight letters.
However, they now seem to have cracked the code themselves though no
details have yet been released concerning the letter's contents.
Einem said on Austrian television Tuesday that police were currently
watching 10 people suspected of involvement in letter-bomb activities
over recent years.
