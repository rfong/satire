More planes due in Tuzla Thursday: spokesman
US Air Force planes are expected to fly into Tuzla Thursday, bringing
more men and equipment into an airbase here which is being set up as
headquarters for 20,000 US GIs due in Bosnia over the next two months,
a US spokesman said.
Lieutenant Colonel Rick Scott said 25 flights were planned for
Thursday.
How many get in and exactly what they bring depends on the weather, he
said, adding that weather at the base was better than the previous day.
Heavy fog shrouded the base Wednesday, forcing the US Air Force to
cancel all but one of the 20 flights it had planned into the base for
the day, a US spokesman said.
There are some 700 US airforce and army personnel currently in Tuzla,
setting up the base which will coordinate the work of the American-led
northeast sector of the 60,000-strong Implementation Force (IFOR).
The United Nations in Sarajevo formally handed over authority in Bosnia
to the IFOR.
The northeast sector, commanded by the 20,000-strong American forces,
will also include smaller contingents from the Nordic countries and
Turkey as well as a contingent from Russia, Scott said.
Operations setting up the base at Tuzla were delayed by several days of
heavy fog in the area last week.
