Thousands exposed to anthrax in US could be vaccinated 
Thousands of workers in the US Congress and US Postal Service, who may
have been exposed to anthrax when letters laced with the bacteria were
mailed to congressmen and media outlets this fall, are now being
offered a vaccine, US health officials have said.
The vaccine -- which until now had only been made available to members
of the military as part of a mandatory immunization regimen -- is being
offered "as a precaution," US Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy
Thompson said in a statement released late Tuesday.
Many of the affected workers are coming to the end of the recommended
60-day course of antibiotics.
Research on monkeys, however, has shown that anthrax spores can persist
in the lungs for up to 100 days.
US health officials, therefore, say there is a very small but real risk
that people exposed to strong doses of the spores could still develop
infections after the 60-day period, although no such case has been
reported.
Those already taking the 60-day treatment will be offered a 40-day
extension of antibiotics, with or without the vaccine.
The Department of Health and Human Services insists that patients who
opt for the vaccine seek a physician's advice on possible risks,
including fever, swelling and, in rare cases, severe allergic
reactions.
Eighteen people contracted anthrax from bacteria-laden letters in the
United States, including five who died from respiratory anthrax, the
most serious form of the disease.
