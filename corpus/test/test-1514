China turns down appeal, orders execution of nine gang members 
China's provincial high court has thrown out an appeal for leniency
from 13 notorious gang members and ordered the execution of nine of
them, the Legal Daily reported Saturday.
The gang of 13, who went on a two-year robbery rampage through China,
killed 17 people and stole more than 1.36 million yuan (164,000
dollars) before they were caught in November.
The newspaper described the case as the most important since the launch
of the "Strike Hard" campaign in April and said the nine were executed
directly after the Guangdong High Court turned down the appeal.
The other four gang members were sentenced to terms ranging from life
imprisonment to 15 years.
More than 2,200 people have been executed since the anti-crime campaign
started.
