20,000 Stranded Herdsmen Reached JIGU, 
All 20,000 herdsmen who were stranded have been reached by rescuers in
the Yushu area of southwest China's Qinghai Province, where some areas
have been cut off by snowstorms for nearly three months.
Officials from the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture said that seven
truckloads of relief supplies have been shipped to Muyuan and Danrong
towns, after two highways connecting Zado county with them were finally
plowed clear.
Li Baoku, head of a working group of the State Council and deputy
minister of Civil Affairs who arrived in the area on February 9,
congratulated local officials on the success of the rescue operation.
Relief supplies from other parts of the country have been shipped to
the blizzard-stricken areas.
Han Wenlu, administrator of the prefecture, said that local officials
are conducting a survey village by village to assess the true damage
and ensure that relief supplies will reach all people in need before
the Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls on February 19.
