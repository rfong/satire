Dhaka Plans to Make Cox's Bazar More Attractive 
With the world's longest beach sloping down to the blue water of the
Bay of Bengal against a chain of tree-covered hills, Cox's Bazar is
known as the tourist capital of Bangladesh.
Located south of Chittagong, the country's second largest city, Cox's
Bazar should have been one of the attractive tourist centers in the
world. However, currently only 10,000 tourists, including 1,000
foreigners, visit the place a year.
And more often than not, tourists experience a lot of inconvenience due
to lack of tourist facilities.
Now the government is considering building a number of tourist
facilities including hotels, motels, restaurants and recreational
centers.
Electric trolley-buses and cable-cars will also be introduced in the
city to make tourists more comfortable and convenient.
The Bangladesh Parjatan (tourism) Corporation (BPC), the sole national
tourism business, is now carrying out a feasibility study on this
project which is designed to turn Cox's Bazar into a real tourist
center in the country.
