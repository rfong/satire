Bi retains title as champ stays away by Tony Lawrence 
Bi Zhong of China retained his Asian Games hammer title here on Monday
after the mystery withdrawal of world and Olympic gold medallist Andrey
Abduvaliyev.
The Games could ill-afford the loss of its top male athlete -- but Bi
showed he was more than happy to take his chance, hurling a new event
record throw of 72.24m to take gold.
That victory came on top of the 26-year-old's Asian Championships
success last year, leaving Koji Murofushi of Japan to mop up the silver
in 67.48. Pakistan's Aqarab Abbas got bronze with a throw of 66.70.
Bi said: "I felt very lucky to have been able to win gold. The Olympic
gold medallist could not come -- fortunately I could and I won."
Tajikistan's Olympic committe secretary general Odil Sabitov revealed:
"Abduvaliyev phoned me to say he was ill on Sunday and would not be
coming -- he said he had a high temperature."
Bi responded to the shock news, only revealed when the starting list
was published on Monday, with an opening throw of 70.98 to put his
rivals under immediate pressure. Nobody was able to match him.
But Bi continued to put together a fine series, with all of his throws
sailing over 70m. His record came with his final effort.
Abduvaliyev, the Asian record holder, was last seen in competition at
the IAAF Grand Prix final in Paris at the start of September, when he
won with a throw of 81.45m.
His two major titles and a personal best of 83.46m made him the huge
favourite here.
It is the second time he has done a disappearing act.
Four years ago the 112kg giant, who skipped the Asian Championships
last year, withdrew without explanation from the European Championships
while warming up.
