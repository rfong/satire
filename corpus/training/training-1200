EU, US begin talks on steel dispute 
The European Union and the United States began initial consultations
here on Tuesday about EU claims for compensation for US tariffs on
imported steel, 24 hours before the US measures are due to take effect.
Brussels and other World Trade Organisation (WTO) countries reject the
US tariffs.
EU and US officials did not comment as they entered the talks at the EU
council offices in Geneva.
Washington announced on March 5 it would impose tariffs of up to 30
percent on certain steel imports by Wednesday.
The EU last week insisted it would pursue claims for initial
compensation at the talks in Geneva.
