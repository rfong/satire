Three-wicket Srinath sends Sri Lanka reeling 
Sri Lanka's World Cup pinch-hitting policy blew up in their faces here
on Wednesday as India grabbed two wickets in the first four balls and
three inside seven overs of their semi-final clash.
A packed Eden Gardens crowd saw Sri Lanka reach the ten-over mark on 59
for three as opening bowler Javagal Srinath took three wickets.
With a single on the board, Romesh Kaluwitharana lashed his first ball
from Srinath off the edge to Sanjay Manjrekar at third man. Two
deliveries later and left-hander Sanath Jayasuriya played an identical
shot to Venkatesh Prasad who was mobbed by his teammates.
Aravinda De Silva, however, faced with surprise opening bowler Anil
Kumble, cracked two consecutive boundaries off the leg spinner, then
drove Srinath through the covers. He made 27 off 20 balls but Asanka
Gurusinha then pulled Srinath off the splice to Kumble at mid on to
make it 35 for three.
But de Silva continued to attack, with three fine fours in a row off
Prasad. Sri Lanka, sent in, reached 50 in the ninth over.
