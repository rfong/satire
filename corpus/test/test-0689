New Chief Pledges to Enhance Role of Thailand's National Think-Tank 
Thanong Bidaya, new chairman of Thailand's National Economic and Social
Development Board (NESDB), reiterated Friday that he planned to push
for a greater role for the national think-tank in government decision
making.
"I want the NESDB to have greater involvement to help administer the
country more practically and effectively," he told the state-owned
radio.
The think-tank currently plays a number of important roles in the
country, including designing the five-year plan for socio- economic
development and approving or rejecting mega-projects proposed by
government agencies and state enterprises.
"The NESDB should play a more pivotal role in all major government
decisions," he said. "And, any important economic initiative should be
reviewed by the think-tank before concrete action is taken."
Answering his critics' concerns regarding political interference into
the NESDB's policies, Thanong said he would put the national interest
highest on his agenda.
"I will tell the government what the Thai people really want. More
advice on economic issues will be forwarded to the cabinet for
consideration," he said.
A source from the Government House said Prime Minister Thaksin
Shinawatra was unsatisfied with recent advice from the NESDB in its
ninth National Economic and Social Development Plan. The information
was released prior to the appointment of Thanong as the NESDB's
chairman.
As a former finance minister and currently the chief economic adviser
of the prime minister, Thanong has aroused worries that his close
political associations could dent NESDB's credibility as an independent
central planning agency.
At present, he also heads the country's newly-established Asset
Management Corporation, the powerful entity to deal with the 1.3
trillion baht (28 billion U.S. dollars) of bad loans which crippled the
Thai banking system for many years.
