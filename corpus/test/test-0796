Hong Kong Seeks Chinese Good Will on Long-Awaited Court 
In an attempt to win Chinese good will, the Hong Kong government
offered Tuesday to amend its plans to set up a long-awaited final
appeals court in the colony.
The Court of Final Appeal would be Hong Kong's highest legal body after
the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. As such, it is
viewed as a vital safeguard of the colony's post-1997 freedoms.
Having agreed in 1991 on the need for the court, China and Britain have
since disagreed on how to set it up. They blame each other for the
delay.
In an apparent attempt to break the deadlock before Chinese and British
negotiators meet on the issue this month, the government said it
accepted certain recommendations on the court put forward by a
Chinese-appointed committee last week.
``We hope that this gesture of sincerity and cooperation will ensure
that rapid progress will be made at the next expert meeting ... and
that the Chinese side will then confirm that they are content with the
draft bill,'' a government statement said.
It added that the bill to set up the court will be amended to include
the recommendations, although officials said the amended bill was
unlikely to be ready in time for this month's meeting.
The recommendations that the government said it accepted are largely
technical _ such as arrangements on who should preside over the court
when the chief justice cannot.
The government said other recommendations put forward by the
Preliminary Working Committee were rejected because they would violate
the agreement ceding Hong Kong to China in 1997 and Hong Kong's
post-1997 constitution.
But just by accepting some PWC recommendations, the government seemed
to be seeking Chinese good will. In the past, it has largely distanced
itself from the Beijing-appointed body.
The committee is made up of Hong Kong and Chinese notables chosen by
Beijing to help it prepare for the 1997 handover.
