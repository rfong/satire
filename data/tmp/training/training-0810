White/NNP twilight/NN ,/, modern/JJ dusk/NN :/: a/DT century/NN of/IN utopian/NN optimism/NN is/VBZ brought/VBN to/TO a/DT quiet/JJ ,/, lyrical/JJ close/NN in/IN the/DT new/JJ ground-floor/JJ galleries/NNS Gae/NNP Aulenti/NNP has/VBZ designed/VBN for/IN the/DT historic/JJ Palazzo/NNP Della/NNP Trienalle/NNP in/IN Milan/NNP ./.

And/CC the/DT show/NN that/WDT inaugurated/VBN the/DT new/JJ space/NN ,/, ``/`` Expressionism/NNP and/CC the/DT New/NNP Objectivity/NNP ,/, ''/'' intensified/VBD the/DT atmosphere/NN of/IN elegy/NN ./.

Focusing/VBG on/IN the/DT pivotal/JJ years/NNS in/IN the/DT mid-1920s/NN when/WRB many/JJ European/JJ architects/NNS embraced/VBD the/DT common/JJ language/NN of/IN the/DT modern/JJ movement/NN ,/, the/DT show/NN ,/, which/WDT runs/VBZ through/IN Sunday/NNP ,/, looked/VBD back/RB to/TO the/DT dawn/NN of/IN a/DT radiant/JJ idea/NN ./.

The/DT Palazzo/NNP Della/NNP Trienalle/NNP ,/, which/WDT was/VBD designed/VBN in/IN 1931/CD by/IN Giovanni/NNP Muzio/NNP ,/, is/VBZ best/RBS known/VBN as/IN the/DT site/NN of/IN an/DT international/JJ design/NN event/NN that/WDT once/RB presented/VBD the/DT most/RBS innovative/JJ ideas/NNS in/IN the/DT field/NN ./.

In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, the/DT event/NN ,/, the/DT Milan/NNP Trienalle/NNP ,/, has/VBZ lost/VBN its/PRP$ international/JJ luster/NN ,/, just/RB as/IN Milan/NNP itself/PRP has/VBZ gone/VBN into/IN eclipse/NNP as/IN a/DT center/NN for/IN pioneering/JJ design/NN ./.

Aulenti/NNP 's/POS new/JJ galleries/NNS have/VBP been/VBN conceived/VBN not/RB only/JJ to/TO burnish/VB the/DT Trienalle/NNP 's/POS reputation/NN but/CC also/RB to/TO reconfigure/VB its/PRP$ mission/NN ./.

The/DT palazzo/NN 's/POS large/JJ ground-floor/NN interiors/NNS were/VBD designed/VBN as/IN flexible/JJ spaces/NNS ,/, so/RB that/IN exhibitors/NNS could/MD overhaul/VB them/PRP to/TO suit/VB their/PRP$ needs/NNS ./.

But/CC ,/, like/IN their/PRP$ counterparts/NNS at/IN the/DT Pompidou/NNP Center/NNP in/IN Paris/NNP ,/, the/DT Trienalle/NNP 's/POS directors/NNS decided/VBD that/IN some/DT exhibitions/NNS would/MD be/VB better/RBR served/VBN by/IN a/DT permanent/JJ setting/NN ./.

Aulenti/NNP ,/, architect/NN of/IN the/DT Pompidou/NNP 's/POS renovated/JJ permanent/JJ galleries/NNS ,/, was/VBD a/DT logical/JJ choice/NN to/TO undertake/VB the/DT same/JJ job/NN here/RB ./.

As/IN someone/NN who/WP has/VBZ often/RB felt/VBN that/IN Aulenti/NNP 's/POS work/NN ,/, while/IN always/RB intelligent/JJ ,/, shows/VBZ a/DT weak/JJ command/NN of/IN space/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ to/TO report/VB that/IN her/PRP$ design/NN for/IN Milan/NNP is/VBZ first-rate/JJ ./.

As/IN with/IN her/PRP$ renovations/NNS of/IN the/DT Palazzo/NNP Grassi/NNP in/IN Venice/NNP and/CC the/DT Musee/NNP d'Orsay/NN in/IN Paris/NNP ,/, Aulenti/NNP took/VBD on/IN a/DT landmark/JJ building/NN ./.

A/DT product/NN of/IN the/DT fascist/JJ era/NN ,/, the/DT Palazzo/NNP Della/NNP Trienalle/NNP represented/VBD an/DT attempt/NN to/TO fuse/VB the/DT two/CD leading/VBG movements/NNS that/WDT competed/VBD to/TO become/VB the/DT official/JJ fascist/JJ style/NN ./.

Neo-classicism/NNP ,/, the/DT style/NN most/RBS often/RB identified/VBN with/IN the/DT regime/NN ,/, dominates/VBZ the/DT design/NN ,/, with/IN its/PRP$ imposing/NNP ,/, symmetrical/JJ entrance/NN ,/, the/DT rows/NNS of/IN high/JJ Roman/NNP arches/NNS that/WDT surround/VBP the/DT lower/JJR floors/NNS and/CC such/JJ features/NNS as/IN the/DT grand/JJ staircase/NN that/WDT jackknifes/VBZ through/IN the/DT atrium/NN lobby/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT regime/NN also/RB supported/VBD Rationalism/NNP ,/, Italy/NNP 's/POS leading/VBG modern/JJ movement/NN ,/, and/CC its/PRP$ influence/NN is/VBZ evident/JJ in/IN the/DT bare/JJ ,/, brick/NN warehouse/NN look/NN of/IN the/DT exterior/NN walls/NNS ,/, the/DT exposed/VBN concrete/JJ structure/NN and/CC the/DT loftlike/JJ interiors/NNS of/IN the/DT exhibition/NN floors/NNS ./.

Gae/NNP Aulenti/NNP continues/VBZ this/DT synthesis/NN of/IN modern/JJ and/CC classical/JJ forms/NNS ./.

Her/PRP$ simple/JJ ,/, spare/JJ design/NN for/IN the/DT 10,000-square-foot/JJ ground-floor/JJ space/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN an/DT ingenious/JJ system/NN of/IN partitions/NNS ./.

Each/DT partition/NN is/VBZ ,/, in/IN effect/NN ,/, an/DT extruded/JJ column/NN ,/, topped/VBN with/IN a/DT ``/`` capital/NN ''/'' that/IN flares/NNS outward/VBD to/TO support/VB small/JJ clusters/NNS of/IN lamps/NNS ./.

Though/IN classically/RB sympathetic/JJ ,/, the/DT walls/NNS are/VBP modern/JJ in/IN their/PRP$ geometric/JJ clarity/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN in/IN their/PRP$ function/NN ,/, for/IN each/DT partition/NN is/VBZ also/RB a/DT mechanical/JJ device/NN that/WDT houses/VBZ equipment/NN for/IN lighting/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC air-conditioning/NN ./.

Set/VB parallel/JJ to/TO form/VB corridors/NNS ,/, or/CC rotated/VBD to/TO enclose/VB a/DT gallery/NN ,/, the/DT convex/NN partitions/VBZ create/VB spaces/NNS at/IN once/RB intimate/JJ and/CC ample/JJ ./.

The/DT partitions/NNS stop/VBP short/JJ of/IN the/DT 23-foot-high/JJ ceiling/NN ,/, exposing/VBG the/DT concrete/JJ structure/NN ./.

Starkly/RB geometric/VBN ,/, yet/CC richly/RB textured/VBN by/IN the/DT shadowed/JJ recesses/NNS between/IN the/DT concrete/JJ beams/NN ,/, the/DT roof/NN creates/VBZ a/DT counterpoint/NN to/TO Aulenti/NNP 's/POS broad/JJ expanses/NNS of/IN white/JJ wall/NN and/CC the/DT diffuse/JJ light/NN that/WDT washes/VBZ over/IN them/PRP ./.

Floor-to-ceiling/JJ windows/NNS look/VBP out/RP onto/IN Sempione/NNP Park/NNP ,/, and/CC at/IN moments/NNS Aulenti/NNP 's/POS design/NN seems/VBZ to/TO pull/VB the/DT park/NN indoors/RB ,/, as/RB if/IN the/DT partitions/NNS had/VBD become/VBN a/DT terrace/NN colonnade/NN ,/, or/CC ,/, more/RBR fancifully/NN ,/, rows/NNS of/IN spreading/VBG trees/NNS ./.

With/IN their/PRP$ dappled/VBN light/NN glinting/VBG off/RP a/DT floor/NN of/IN dark/JJ stained/JJ wood/NN ,/, these/DT galleries/NNS are/VBP a/DT winter/NN garden/NN of/IN shadows/NNS ./.
