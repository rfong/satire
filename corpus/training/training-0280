Family Waits For Positive ID of World War II Pilot Shot Down Over 
The Gallion family waited Monday for Dutch authorities to determine if
a body found in the wreckage of a plane that wend down over Holland
during World War II is that of their long-lost relative.
Dutch officials said Monday they were checking medical records to
determine if the body found in a submerged P-47 Delta Thunderbolt last
week was that of Frank Gallion, a pilot declared missing in action in
1943 after his plane was seen going down over the IJsselmeer inland
sea.
Gallion, 24, had been escorting B-17 bombers to an attack on a German
navy base in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, when he was shot down by
Messerschmitt 109 fighters.
The body was in the cockpit when the wreckage was brought up Friday.
The plane had been discovered in an October 1993 survey of the sea,
about 50 miles (80 kilometers ) north of Amsterdam.
The plane, which had broken in two, was still equipped with three of
its six machine guns.
Gary Gallion, 41, of Millersburg, a community of about 3,200 people 60
miles (100 kilometers) northeast of Columbus, said he learned Saturday
that his uncle's plane might have been found.
``Initially it was a surprise, some denial, wondering is it really
true,'' said Gallion. ``I would hate for something to happen and it not
be true.''
He said Dutch authorities told him Monday that Gallion's dog tags were
found in the plane. They also found boots and parts of a jacket they
believe belonged to the pilot.
