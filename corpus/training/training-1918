World's oldest man celebrates 113th birthday in Japan 
Yukichi Chuganji, the world oldest man, celebrated his 113th birthday
on Saturday by being named an honorary citizen of Ogri, his home town
on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu.
Dressed in a traditional Kimono, Chuganji also received gifts from the
mayor of Ogri and the governor of Fukuoka prefecture.
"Thank you very much," he said with a big smile as he received the
governor's presents.
Chuganji was recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the world's
oldest man in January after the death of Italian Antonio Todde at the
age of 112.
The world's oldest known woman, 114-year-old Kamato Hongo, also lives
on the island of Kyushu.
Chuganji suffers from poor eyesight and usually spends most of his days
sleeping.
But according to his 72-year-old daughter, he still eats three meals a
day, maintains a keen interest in world affairs and is aware of his
status as the world's oldest man.
"The secrets to his longevity are to eat moderately and not to worry
about things," the daughter, Kyoko, told the Asahi Shimbum newspaper.
Chuganji was born in 1889, the same year the Eiffel Tower was built,
and made his living breeding silkworms and later working for a bank.
He continued to cycle into his 90s, was still climbing ladders to prune
trees at the age of 100 and has seven grandchildren and 12
great-grandchildren.
The longevity of the Japanese is often attributed to a diet which
includes lots of fish and vegetables. But Chuganji's daughter told AFP
last month that her father hated vegetables and loved eating meat and
drinking milk.
The oldest fully authenticated age to which any human has ever lived is
122 years and 164 days -- registered by Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise
Calment who died in 1997. She famously attributed her longevity to a
daily tipple of port.
