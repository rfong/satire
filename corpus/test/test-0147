Bangladesh Revenue Collection May Be Short of Target 
Bangladesh's revenue collection for the current fiscal year ending June
30 may fall short of its target of 196.24 billion taka (about 4.23
billion U.S. dollars) by more than 14 billion taka (about 302 million
dollars), or some 7 percent.
Earnings from the non-tax sectors, such as state-run enterprises, and
financial and other institutions, could be nearly 5 billion taka (about
108 million dollars) short of the target, the Financial Express daily
Saturday quoted the Finance Ministry as saying.
Profit and dividend earnings from state enterprises alone could be 2.5
billion taka (about 54 million dollars) lower than the target.
Officials attributed the shortfall in non-tax revenue collection to low
earnings from the transport and communications sector, the losses
suffered by the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, and the poor
performance of most state-run financial and industrial enterprises.
And the shortfall in tax revenue collection was estimated at 9.44
billion taka (203.9 million dollars) in April this year. Stagnation in
economic activities, low imports, a fall in industrial production and
smuggling of foreign goods into the country were partially responsible
for the shortfall, according to the report.
Due to the shortfall in revenue collection, the Finance Ministry
proposed a major cut in the country's development expenditure, the
report said.
