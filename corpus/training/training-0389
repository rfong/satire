Northrop Grumman prepared to boost for TRW offer: TRW rejects effort
Northrop Grumman, the defense giant engaged in a hostile bid for TRW, said
Tuesday it was prepared to boost its six billion dollar bid if TRW could
show that a higher bid "is warranted."
But TRW rejected the approach, calling it "nothing new."
The Northrop announcement came a day after the board of TRW, an
aerospace and auto parts firm, refused to provide Northrop with
confidential, business-sensitive information about the company, and
urged shareholders to reject the same proposal.
Los Angeles-based Northrop, which could become the biggest US defense
contractor if the deal goes through, said it is now reviNorthrop's
chairman and chief executive officer.
He added that Northrop would increase its bid "it if due diligence
shows that a higher value is warranted."
TRW claimed that Northrop Grumman's efforts to get key data were "both
unnecessary and self-serving and are part of its ongoing effort to
force TRW shareholders to accept its below-mQskft 47 (dollar) per
shareenying Northrop Grumman the opportunity to evaluate the
information we need to consider an increase in our current offer."
issued a statement dismissing the latest effort by Northrop.
"There is nothing new in today's announcement by Northrop Grumman," TRW
said. "The TRW board continues to urge TRW shareholders to reject
Northrop's grossly inadequate, below-market 47 dollar per share offer.
In light of this offer -- now more than four dollars below TRW's
current market price -- it simply makes no sense for TRW to share
confidential, business sensitive information with Northrop Grumman."
The Cleveland, Ohio, company, which is coveted for its sophisticated
laser technology being developed for missile defense, has devised a
strategy to fight off the merger by spinning off its auto parts
business and by accelerating debt reduction. Its board will consider
these proposals next month.
