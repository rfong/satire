We are superior, says Real coach Vicente Del Bosque
Real Madrid coach Vicente Del Bosque said on Tuesday his team were
superior to Barcelona and the favourites to reach the European
Champions League final.
Del Bosque broke into a rare smile at the press conference ahead of the
semi-final second leg on Wednesday, safe in the knowledge that Real
have a 2-0 cushion after their emphatic first leg victory in their
bitter rivals' Nou Camp stadium last week.
"We are superior, and the favourites, of this there is no doubt," said
the usually taciturn Del Bosque.
"And we'll be demonstrating our superiority in the Bernabeu once
again," he added.
Real are unbeaten in their 75,000-capacity Santiago Bernabeu stadium
this season, apart from a 2-1 loss to Deportivo La Coruna in the
Spanish Cup final, which was staged in the Bernabeu as part of Madrid's
centennial celebrations.
Del Bosque hinted though that Real would be playing in a much more
conservative style than the one they unveiled in Barcelona, despite the
fact that the current World Player of the Year Luis Figo will return
after being suspended for the first leg.
Figo is the one change in the Real Madrid starting line up from last
week's encounter as Real seek a place in the final in Glasgow on May
15.
Spanish international Ivan Helguera will move back to play in the
centre of the defence in order to accommodate the Portuguese winger
with defender Francisco Pavon, the only uncapped player in Real's first
team squad, having to settle for a spot on the bench.
"We are going to play with as much control as possible. We have got a
2-0 advantage and I'm not going to do anything which puts victory in
jeopardy," said Del Bosque on Tuesday.
His counter-attacking tactics were reiterated by Real Madrid's captain
Fernando Hierro at another we have to compete if we are to get through
to the final and our obligation is to win," commented Hierro.
"Perhaps the way we will play is the way we did against Bayern
(Munich)," added Hierro, referring to Real's 2-0 defeat of the Germans
in their quarter-final second leg, which was played in the Bernabeu and
which saw Madrid launch fast attacks after absorbing Bayern's
firepower.
Hierro added that the 3-0 defeat at Real Sociedad in the Spanish League
on Saturday had not affected the team's morale.
"It gave us a bit of a kick up the backside and it has already been
forgotten about," said the 34-year-old central defender.
