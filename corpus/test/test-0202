Renault Shares Leap 12 Percent on First Day of Trading 
Shares in French automaker Renault SA were traded for the first time
Thursday, leaping 12 percent to close at 184.90 francs (dlrs 35.60).
Some 9 million Renault shares were traded Thursday, rising 12.06
percent from their opening price of 165 francs (dlrs 31.70).
The French government reduced its stake in Renault from 79.2 percent to
50.1 percent earlier this months, selling off about 61.9 million shares
to private and institutional investors.
The selling off of the shares was part of the project by the
conservative government, elected in March of last year, to privatize
state-controlled companies.
Traders reported many small orders Thursday, indicating that individual
shareholders were cashing out of their shares immediately.
Nevertheless, many large funds appeared to be willing buyers, they
added.
The trading in Renault brightened an otherwise dull session at the
Paris bourse.
Renault is Europe's sixth-biggest car maker, worth just under 40
billion francs (dlrs 8 billion), according to the government.
Chairman Louis Schweitzer said in an an interview earlier this month
that no reason exists to stop the company from eventual full
privatization.
Renault bottomed out in the mid-1980s, losing 25 billion francs (dlrs 5
billion) from 1982-85. Bankruptcy was avoided through state injections
of funds.
By 1990, Renault had improved productivity and quality enough to begin
a merger process with Swedish automaker AB Volvo. It fell apart last
December over objections by Volvo shareholders to French government
insistence on keeping a controlling share in Renault.
Volvo, which currently holds a 20 percent share of Renault, will wait
and see before cashing in on an option to sell 12 percent of its
partnership.
Under an agreement between Volvo and French officials, Volvo will sell
only 8 percent of its shares for now.
