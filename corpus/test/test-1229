Lithuanian Historian Day
A staff member interrupted my judo session this morning to tell me that
some documents recently surfaced in Lithuania much to the KGB's
chagrin. My aide cowered in fear thinking I would be angry with him.
Yes, I suplexed him, and I followed that up with elbow strikes to his
temple. But I was not angry. Just finishing my training. In fact, I am
the opposite of angry. I am happy.
In Russia, I have decided to make a holiday where we will honor all of
the Lithuanian historians. Yes, it will be very festive. I'm inviting
of all the Lithuanian historians to Russia so we can have a nice meet
and greet. The invitation details are below:
To: All Lithuanian Historians
From: President Putin
Subject: Giving Lithuanian Historians What They Deserve
Congratulations, you amazing historians. Your hard work has paid off,
and you have made the old Soviet Union seem wicked and totalitarian.
Ha! Good work.
The promoting of this holiday will not be widespread as we do not want
a mob scene. For security purposes please tell no one of your visit. If
anyone asks, say you're going on a long vacation. If you have a diary
or something you write in, and you want to write that you've been
invited to Russia for Lithuanian Historians' Day, fine. But please
bring the journal with you when you come.
The location will be in the bottom of an old abandoned coliseum in St.
Petersburg. We have many fun activities planned such as hole digging
contests and unmarked liquid tasting stands. If you cannot make the
trip, please let us know, and we will send you a heavy, unmarked
package with a gift inside.
We look forward to your attendance and your complete and absolute
adherence to our rules. It should be fun.
Sincerely,
President Vladimir Putin
