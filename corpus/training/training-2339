He took leave from his job as managing partner of the Texas Rangers
ballclub to challenge Richards and launched his bid a year ago.
At that point, Richards had been in office nearly three years. She took
office in 1991 by defeating Clayton Williams Jr. by less than 100,000
votes -- 1.9 million to Williams' 1.8 million.
Richards' 1990 victory contradicted most of the pre-election polls and
was attributed to strong support among women and minorities. She
campaigned with a promise to create a ``New Texas,'' a theme she rarely
referred to in 1994.
Richards rose to the governorship after eight years as state treasurer
and a 6-year stint as a Travis County commissioner, never losing in
five elections en route to the Governor's Mansion.
Before capturing county office in 1976 at age 43, Richards was a
legislative aide to abortion rights lawyer Sarah Weddington and was
active in the civil rights movement. Her involvement in liberal causes
and support of minority groups aligned her with a Democratic machine
that repeatedly proved helpful to her.
But this time, the machine faltered and Richards failed in her bid to
become the first governor elected to consecutive four-year terms, which
began in 1975.
Though Richards was the favorite of women and minorities, she didn't
draw their support as strongly as in 1990. Some core constituency
groups said she hadn't done enough for them and accused her of breaking
promises.
As much as she tried to call attention to her positive deeds, Bush
still managed to keep her on the defensive during the final months of
their yearlong race. The Republican's advertising began in mid-summer
and continued hammering her policies until election eve.
