Japan's Military Chief Ends Visit to Russia 
The director-general of Japan's National Defense Agency, Hideo Usui,
returned home today after signing an agreement in Moscow to expand
bilateral military cooperation with Russia.
Usui called his visit the first historic step towards improvement of
the Japanese-Russian ties.
During his visit, Usui met Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and inspected Russian military
troops.
The two military heads agreed to take concrete trust-building measures
including informing each other of large-scale military exercises and
increasing contacts between the defense authorities of the two
countries.
Usui went to Moscow last Friday for a three-day official visit, the
first by a Japanese military chief in the history of the two countries'
relations.
