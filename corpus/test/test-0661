IMF pressuring Russia on reforms without throwing it overboard
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided to continue
pressuring the Russian government for firm commitments to reform, and
IMF envoys were to leave Moscow on Tuesday without having approved a
crucial loan of 6.4 billion dollars, already in the 1995 Russian
budget.
But the international monetary agency will undoubtedly avoid throwing
Russia overboard by a categorical refusal, which would compromise the
continuation of three years of reforms and the process of anchoring the
country firmly in the international community.
The IMF delegation arrived in the Russian capital on January 18 and
finished its assignment on Monday, after almost three weeks of
negotiations, with a final meeting with the Russian government aimed at
drawing up a list of points of agreement and of the numerous issues
still pending.
There are even more reasons now than last year for refusing
unconditional international loans, including inflationary slippage in
January (17.8 percent inflation for the month), tension on the ruble,
and the war in Chechnya, which endangers budget austerity objectives.
Many months of discussions were needed to obtain release in March of an
IMF loan of 1.5 billion dollars to Russia.
"Very many difficulties remain, and it is in the IMF's interest to
delay agreement to pressure the Russian government and parliament, and
to obtain as many commitments to reform as possible", said one western
financier on Monday.
Even before release of the official communique, Russian finance
minister Vladimir Panskov said that this year Russia would receive less
than the 13 billion dollars in international credits already included
in budget receipts (out of total planned receipts of 42 billion
dollars).
The minister said in a television interview that "We will not receive
the stand-by credit of six billion dollars from the IMF, and we might
not obtain a credit of 600 million dollars for rehabilitation. We shall
try to find extra sources of finance from Russian investors with the
help of state treasury and bond issues."
And he added: "But as minister, I will remain inflexible about the
tough basis of the budget and of the deficit".
Even with the planned 13 billion dollars' worth of international aid,
the austerity-oriented 1995 budget objectives - calling for a deficit
of 7.8 percent of GDP, which would not be covered by cheap central bank
credits, but rather by issues of state securities - already seemed hard
to reach.
"But without foreign credits, they (the objectives) become impossible
to meet", said one economist.
So many experts think it unlikely that the IMF's refusal is final, and
Panskov's defeatist remarks may be aimed at "scaring some hesitant
members of parliament", they say. Parliament is soon to discuss the
government budget on third reading, article by article. The highly
controversial document was adopted as a whole by the Duma on January
25, but now comes up for detailed discussion.
"If the IMF has more reasons this year to refuse funds for Russia than
last year, it also has many more reasons to grant them", said one
international financier.
"The IMF has just come up with 17 billion dollars for Mexico, whose
economic and political situation is not much more predictable. It can't
let Russia down, as the country might decide to cut itself off, to
close its financial markets..."
But the fund has to play its hand delicately. By delaying approval, it
can extract firmer commitments from the Russian authorities.
This is a crucial year, as Russian is going to have to make choices in
many fields, such as the foreign exchange market, liberalization of the
oil sector, and safeguarding federal union at any price.
"This is the year of obligatory decisions, after three years during
which one could still sign a decree with one hand and give telephone
instructions with the other", said one economist.
And one financier asking to remain anonymous said that "Russia has its
nose up against the wall. It has to either stop or destroy the wall.
The IMF can't abandon it now".
In addition to the stand-by loan, the fund was planning this year to
set up a stabilization fund for the ruble of around six billion dollars
and to provide a structural assistance loan of four billion.
