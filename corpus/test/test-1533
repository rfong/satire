Medvedev's clash against popular Frenchman Guy Forget ended prematurely
when he was forced to retire with an elbow injury. He was trailing 4-6,
1-2 when he decided to quit.
He later revealed that he had first felt a twinge while training on
Friday.
"I went to see the trainer on Monday but by then it was probably too
late," he said.
"The Tournament doctor thinks I have damaged the tendon in the elbow
and I shall have to rest for a couple of weeks. Lately I changed my
racket strings from thick ones to thin ones," he said as one possible
explication for the injury.
The elimination of Courier and Medvedev meant that six seeds failed to
clear their opening hurdles. On Tuesday Michael Stich, Stefan Edberg,
Wayne Ferreira and Thomas Muster were also sent packing.
Forget, the 1991 champion, now plays sixth-seed Becker for a place in
the quarter-finals. The powerful German took a first step towards his
fourth victory at event by beating Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands.
But he was pushed hard, especially in the early stages of the match,
before clinching a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win.
Becker, who qualified for next month's elite eight-man ATP Championship
finals in Frankfurt and who jumped to number-three in the rankings when
he triumphed at the Stockholm Open last weekend, hammered down 16 aces
but took time to adapt to the slower Bercy Stadium court surface. He
nevertheless remains a hot favourite to repeat his 1986, 1989 and 1992
successes.
World number-one Pete Sampras also dropped a set and was given an even
stiffer work out by Dutch opponent Jacco Eltingh.
Sampras, playing for the first time since losing to Becker in the
Stockholm semi-final -- only his sixth defeat of the season -- finally
clinched a 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 win in just over one and a half hours when he
broke Eltingh for a third time in the match in the final game.
He now plays another Dutch player Richard Krajicek, who earlier in the
day hammered down 17 aces while destroying Renzo Furlan of Italy 6-3,
6-3.
"It's like playing the Davis Cup all over again," said Sampras,
referring to the hard-fought tie between the United States and Holland
in Rotterdam in July.
"They are both very dangerous players."
