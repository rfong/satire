AN ANGRY MAN FOUND HIMSELF IN `TOM JONES' (BC-RICHARDSON-FILMS-$ADV21-NYT)
In Tony Richardson's engagingly chatty memoir, ``The Long-Distance
Runner,'' the English film director who died three years ago expresses
surprisingly negative feelings about ``Tom Jones,'' the movie that many
consider his masterpiece.
While allowing that its success was ``a very agreeable thing to have to
deal with,'' Richardson adds: ``I felt the movie to be incomplete and
botched in much of its execution. Whenever someone gushes to me about
`Tom Jones,' I always cringe a little inside.''
Richardson's disappointment in the movie is unusual considering that it
gave him the kind of perfect career moment most directors only dream
of. (``Tom Jones'' will be shown as part of a two-and-a-half-week Film
Society of Lincoln Center retrospective of Richardson's work that
begins on Friday; on Wednesday, there will be a benefit showing of
Richardson's last film, ``Blue Sky.'')
When ``Tom Jones'' was released in 1963, the critics raved, the box
office boomed and the movie went on to win four Academy Awards,
including best director, and to became one of the biggest hits of the
early 1960s.
In retrospect, ``Tom Jones'' seemed to distill the heady excitement of
an era when ``swinging England'' was being born. Very briefly, the
critical spotlight that had fastened on Fellini, Antonioni, Bergman and
French New Wave directors swung back to the British cinema where
Richardson, along with Karel Reisz and Lindsay Anderson, had refined
the so-called kitchen sink school of social realism.
Kitchen sink cinema combined the sooty live-from-the-slums look of
Italian neo-realism with playful New Wave techniques developed by
Francois Truffaut and others. What eloquence the genre achieved had
less finally to do with slice-of-life veracity than with the emergence
of a young generation of British actors -- among them Albert Finney,
Richard Harris, Alan Bates and Tom Courtenay -- who brought an
oratorical fury to their embattled working-class characters.
Richardson had made his reputation directing the stage dramas and later
the screen adaptations of John Osborne's ``Look Back in Anger'' and
``The Entertainer,'' as well as ``A Taste of Honey'' and ``The
Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner.''
In ``The Entertainer,'' Laurence Olivier turns in one of his two or
three greatest screen performances as Archie Rice, a seedy middle-aged
music hall performer whose sagging fortunes become an overworked
metaphor for Britain's decline.
Although ``Tom Jones'' dealt with kitchen sink issues like class
struggle and included pointedly gory, mud-caked scenes of 18th-century
rural life, it was also a triumphant break from the genre. This
picaresque comic romp, adapted by Richardson with Osborne from Henry
Fielding's novel, revelled voraciously in the physical world.
Everybody in the film, even its villains, seemed to be having a fine
old time. The movie presented a dictionary of up-to-the-minute
cinematic tricks -- freeze frames, characters addressing the camera,
sped-up action and an occasional narrator -- that was almost cheeky in
its virtuosity. Anything that could keep the movie's narrative momentum
chugging at full speed was brought in, and it all worked.
When ``Tom Jones'' appeared, England was only beginning to emerge from
a grim postwar austerity. Arriving just on the eve of Beatlemania and
the British Invasion, the film made an international star of Finney,
whose smoldering, slightly loutish lubricity helped set the mold for a
new generation of English male rock stars.
The film's flaunting of a delirious full-blooded sensuality, a quality
rarely found in British films, contributed immeasurably to its success.
With its satirically edged portrait of a robust 18th-century society in
which sexually liberated youth triumphed over sour-faced prudes, ``Tom
Jones'' anticipated the rampant hedonism that was right around the
corner. Its subliminal message seemed to be that if English life used
to be this much fun, why shouldn't it be that way again?
``Tom Jones'' reaches a peak of naughtiness in the notorious eating
scene in which Finney and Joyce Redman leer at each other while making
lascivious overtures to morsels from their dinner plates. In 1963, the
scene was considered the ne plus ultra of racy double-entendre.
Revisited today, ``Tom Jones'' is still remarkable for the lustful
performances of three of its actresses: Miss Redman, Diane Cilento, and
Joan Greenwood.
Greenwood's elegant turn as a mature seductress with a yen for younger
men also foreshadows Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson in ``The Graduate,''
which came four years after ``Tom Jones.''
In much the same way that Richardson's hit announced the arrival of
``swinging England,'' ``The Graduate,'' an even bigger blockbuster,
distilled the mood of American youth at the dawn of the counterculture.
Richardson's golden moment was short-lived. After ``Tom Jones'' he
never directed another major hit. His next film was a commercially
unsuccessful adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's ``Loved One,'' in which the
element of caricature was pushed to the grotesque.
To his credit, Richardson never settled into a stylistic or commercial
rut. He took an artistically adventurous road, filming the works of
writers as diverse as Vladimir Nabokov (``Laughter in the Dark''),
Edward Albee (``A Delicate Balance''), John Irving (``The Hotel New
Hampshire'') and Shakespeare (a critically acclaimed ``Hamlet'' done
mostly with talking heads).
Seen in the context of a career that never settled into a predictable
niche, ``Tom Jones'' stands as a magnificent fluke. It is very possible
that its creator never really understood what made it so special.
