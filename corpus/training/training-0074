Sumo remains under foreign champion 
Popular sumo wrestler Takanohana failed to win a promotion to the
number one spot in the Japanese national sport on Monday, leaving the
top position occupied by an American.
An advisory body of the Sumo Association studying promotions to
yokozuna, the highest position in the thousand-year-old sport, agreed
to postpone his advancement until after the next tournament in
November.
The 22-year-old Japanese wrestler, ranked second equally with his elder
brother, Wakanohana, won the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament that ended
Sunday in Tokyo without any defeats.
But his performance was still not good enough to match conditions for
the promotion. Sumo experts say promotion requires candidates to
register consecutive victories or "have an equivalent showing in the
past few tournaments."
Takanohana failed to win the previous tournament, finishing it with an
11-4 record, which was seen as "insufficient" to become a Yokozuna, the
ranking that is solely held by American wrestler Akebono.
Since January 1993, Akenono, a Hawaiian whose real name is Chad Rowan,
has kept the ranking, fending off bids by Japanese wrestlers.
Local conservatives have said Takanohana should have become a yokozuna,
saying that it was shameful to see no Japanese yokozuna in the sport
for such a long time.
Takanohana, who is 186 centimeters (six foot two inches) tall and
weighs 145 kilograms (319 pounds), was once engaged to starlet Rie
Miyazawa.
The vague rules on promotion to yokozuna drew criticism two years ago
when another American wrestler, Konoshiki, failed to be promoted.
Konoshiki, a Hawaiian whose real name is Salevaa Atisanoe, claimed at
the time that his failure to gain the ranking was due to
"discrimination" against foreigners in the sport.
