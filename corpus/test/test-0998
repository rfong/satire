"At the beginning she put a lot of pressure on me but I played better
in the second set," smiled Hingis after her win.
"It was incredible to have everybody cheering for me like that.
"I think in the last year I have grown more confident. I'm a lot more
sure of myself now. But every match is different and you have to take
it step by step.
"Hopefully my next match will not be as difficult as it was today."
