16 Tons of Marijuana Seized; Biggest Find in Europe This Year 
Their suspicion aroused by a freight bill for a container full of
leather strips, German customs officers on Thursday seized 16 tons of
Colombian marijuana with a retail worth of 100 million dollars.
``It is the biggest seizure since the beginning of the year in
Europe,'' said Hans De La Motte, head of Hamburg's customs police.
The 40-foot-long (12-meter) container reached Hamburg, Germany's
busiest port, on Wednesday aboard the Hong Kong-registered freighter
CGM Magellan, police said.
It had started its journey in the Colombian port of Buenaventura,
addressed to a Hamburg company whose name police did not release.
The company had been investigated but no one was arrested, police said.
The freight bill with the inexact notation of leather strips caused
customs officers to take drug-sniffing dogs to check the container
Thursday morning.
``There were plastic shoes and leather bits right behind the door but
directly behind that were sacks with the marijuana,'' said Hamburg
customs spokesman Sigmund Zwirn.
The gross weight of the seized two-kilogram (4.4-pound) sacks was 21
tons, he said, and the net weight of the marijuana was at least 16 tons
with an estimated retail value of 160 million marks or about dlrs 100
million.
Zwirn said the smugglers had not taken special measures to disguise the
shipment, and drug-sniffing dogs would have discovered it even without
the suspicion of the customs officers.
But since about 2 million containers annually pass through the busy
North Sea port, customs police are not able to check a large percentage
of the freight and believe their rate of drug finds is rather low.
De La Motte said, however, that Thursday's big find was proof that even
such a big port as Hamburg has some controls.
