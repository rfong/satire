Japanese, Indonesians, South African Fishing Crew Stranded On Island 
A Japanese and Indonesian fishing crew has scrambled safely onto the
remote, uninhabited volcanic island of St. Paul in the Indian Ocean
after their stricken vessel ran aground five days ago.
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said an air force Hercules has
dropped food and a radio to the 15 Japanese, six Indonesians and one
South African on the island.
The crew was stranded when the vessel, the Zuiho Maru, was grounded in
rough seas.
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which has been co-ordinating
the rescue, said the Hercules flew to Mauritius, a gruelling 12-hour
flight, where it had stood by waiting for weather to improve so it
could drop supplies to the stranded crew.
St. Paul was another 13 to 14 hour round trip from Mauritius, the
maximum endurance range for the Hercules.
Three other Japanese fishing vessels, which do not have emergency
landing equipment, stood by in case the Zuiho Maru, a 472-ton tuna
long-line fishing boat, started to break up.
AMSA said taking the fishermen off the island was still a problem.
Options included diverting a navy vessel with a helicopter or using
special parachute forces and rescue craft.
St. Paul island, a speck in the middle of the ocean, is French
territory. But under an international maritime agreement, Australia is
responsible for rescues in this zone.
St. Paul is approximately 1,920 nautical miles from Perth, 1,530
nautical miles from Mauritius, and 1,500 nautical miles from the French
territory of La Reunion.
The French navy at La Reunion has despatched a French research vessel
and the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency has diverted the Kyo Maru to
the island.
Both vessels are equipped with rescue facilities but are not expected
to reach St Paul until Aug. 2.
A further air drop has been requested by the Japanese agency.
