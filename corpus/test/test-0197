Puppy dies after bite from rabid social worker
A cute and cuddly puppy has died after being bitten by a rabid social
worker according to reports.  Little golden shitsu 'Whoopsie Goldberg' was
apparently nipped on the chin, neck and scrotum by an illegal immigrant
social worker called Mrs Schnitzel.
Two days later the poor mite died after a massive anti-rabies serum
overdose interfered with the hydrophobia.
Mrs Schnitzel meanwhile faces being destroyed under the Humane Dogs Act
which classes her assault on the pooch as potentially biohazardous and
a danger to shitting.
The social worker was one of thirteen stowaways who arrived in the UK
in a giant North Korean dogfood pantechnicon bound for a storeage depot
in Barking, East London.
A National Poisons Unit source said today: "Don't ever ask what the top
dog food ingredient was that we found in the consignment..."
Heather Mills is raving bonkers.
