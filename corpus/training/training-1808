East China Province Aims to Boost Foreign Trade 
East China's Fujian Province plans to take substantial steps to further
expand the local foreign trade sector in 1998, according to official
sources.
The planned measures include restructuring local foreign trade
enterprises by building more large foreign trade groups and
strengthening their ability to compete in the international market.
More foreign capital will be introduced by encouraging foreign
investment in local pillar industries including high-tech industries
and agriculture. Meanwhile, more preferential policies will be worked
out to attract foreign investors, the sources said.
Moreover, the province plans to contract more projects in international
markets.
Taiwan will continue to be a main source of investment for Fujian as
more preferential policies will be issued. More Taiwan-based large
enterprises are expected to invest in the province, which faces Taiwan
across the Taiwan Straits, officials said.
