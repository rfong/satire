Admiral Smith to vist Serb-held Banja Luka on Friday 
Admiral Leighton Smith, overall commander of the NATO-led
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia, is to visit the Bosnian Serb
town of Banja Luka on Friday, an IFOR spokesman said here.
Captain Mark Van Dyke said that the admiral would travel to the
northwestern city "to meet the Bosnian Serb authorities."
Smith visited the Serb stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo for the first
time on Tuesday.
After meeting Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serb
parliament, he said he would "consider" delaying the hand-over of
Serb-held parts of Sarajevo to the Bosnian government.
Under the peace accord for Bosnia, Serb-held parts of the capital are
to be transferred to the control of a Moslem-Croat federation.
Smith's remarks angered Bosnian officials who said he had overstepped
his mandate and a letter would be sent to him expressing the Bosnian
government's "displeasure."
The schedule of his visit to Banja Luka will be made public later
Thursday, Van Dyke said.
