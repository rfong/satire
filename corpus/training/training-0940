Toshiba group profit up 15 percent in first half 
Japan's Toshiba Corp. said Wednesday its consolidated pre-tax profit
rose 15 percent from a year earlier to 41.8 billion yen (418 million
dollars) in the six months to September.
The leading electronics maker said group sales for the period levelled
off at 2,213.9 billion yen.
The company said overseas markets were generally favourable, but the
continuing appreciation of the yen and the delayed recovery in
corporate capital investment had a negative influence on overall
results.
Sales of information and communication systems and electronic devices
gained 10 percent to 1,217.8 billion yen, reflecting brisk personal
computer demand in overseas markets, particularly in the United States,
Toshiba said.
But sales of heavy electrical apparatus dropped 23 percent to 464.4
billion yen due partly to restrained capital investment by the private
sector, it said.
Consumer electronics sales were up five percent at 697.1 billion yen.
The sector-by-sector sales included tradings within groups, and sales
of some products were counted in two or more segments.
Sales in overseas markets totaled 716 billion yen, accounting for 32
percent of the overall sales.
For the year to March, Toshiba forecast a group pre-tax profit of 105
billion yen, up 16 percent from the previous year, on sales of 4,750
billion yen, up three percent.
