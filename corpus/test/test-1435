Africa To Eliminate Polio by 2000
South African President Nelson Mandela today kicked off an
international drive to rid Africa of poliomyelitis by the year 2000,
saying the immediate target is to vaccinate 50 million African children
this year.
Speaking at the launching ceremony at Midrand north of Johannesburg,
which was attended by international health officials and dignitaries
from African countries, Mandela said: "Our aim is not merely to reduce
the number afflicted, it is to eliminate the disease completely."
The campaign is initiated by the World Health Organisation, which has
appointed Mandela Chairman of the WHO's committee for a polio-free
Africa.
The slogan of the campaign, "kick polio out of Africa", would be
displayed at soccer world cup qualifying matches throughout Africa.
Mandela said the legacy of Africa's colonial past, its lack of
resources and the devastation of war had rendered the continent's
children vulnerable to polio.
Much had already been achieved to fight the disease in Africa, and the
incidence of polio among children had fallen from more than 4000 in
1990 to less than 1000 in 1993.
Twenty-nine African countries had been so far taking part in the
program. They would also organise national immunisation days to
vaccinate 80 million children over the next 18 months.
South Africa's first immunisation day will be on August 12.
Meanwhile, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma, who hosted the launch, said
South Africa's target is to wipe out polio by 1998.
