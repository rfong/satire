British Retail Business Reports Annual Increase 
Britain's retail business, which suffered from the lack of consumer
confidence this year, reported the biggest annual increase in sales
volume in October.
According to the latest monthly distributive survey by the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the October retail sales
returned to the spring level, boosted by mid-season cut-price sales
after the poor months of August and September.
Some 44 percent of retailers said sales volumes were up from that a
year ago while only 28 percent said sales were down.
Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said:
"The upturn in retail sales last month was encouraging, particularly as
it followed weak trade towards the end of the summer."
Britain's economic growth is slowing down with the gross domestic
product (GDP) rising only 2.4 percent annually in the third quarter,
compared with 3.8 and 2.8 percent in the first two quarters.
The sluggish retail sales and housing market well reflected the poor
consumer confidence in the economy.
In spite of the upturn in the sales volume in October, the CBI survey
found that spending in shops remains well below average for the time of
year.
