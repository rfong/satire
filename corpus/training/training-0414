Ukraine Forecasts 2 Percent GDP Growth for 2000 
The Ukrainian government Wednesday announced a readjusted economic
forecast for the year 2000, raising the targeted GDP growth rate to 2
percent, twice the figure anticipated in February.
Ukraine will witness an inflation rate of 18.5 percent in 2000 and its
currency, hryvina, will be devalued from the current price of 5.4
hryvina for one U.S. dollar to 6.2 hryvina for one dollar, according to
the figures released by the Ministry of Economy.
By the end of this year, the country's foreign reserve will amount to
1.75 billion U.S. dollars, 60 percent higher than in 1999, said the
ministry.
In February, the government had forecast a lower growth with less
inflation for 2000, saying that the gross domestic product would
increase by 1 percent and the inflation rate would hit 15.9 percent.
In the first four months, Ukraine registered a GDP growth of 5. 5
percent and its foreign reserve now stands at nearly 1 billion dollars.
