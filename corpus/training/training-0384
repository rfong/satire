Strong China Good for World: Russian Legislator 
A strong China is good for the rest of the world, says Vladimir Lukin,
chairman of the International Affairs Committee of Russia's State Duma
(lower house of parliament).
"The rise of China doesn't leave an impression of chauvinism and
hegemonism," Lukin told Xinhua in a recent interview.
The active participation of China in international organizations is
conducive to world peace, he said.
He predicted that in the next century, China would become an
influential member of the international community. China will get
strong but it will not seek aggression or expansion, he said.
Russia, meanwhile, will overcome its crisis and rise as a strong power
in Eurasia. In five to eight years, Russia may embrace an economic
miracle, he predicted.
Both China and Russia will play more important roles in the future
multipolar world, he said.
He also spoke of the coming 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China.
The congress was of great significance, he said. "We are looking
forward with joy to the opening of the congress."
China saw rapid development after the 14th national congress of the
party in 1992, he said.
The national congress is the first since the passing away of Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, who was a statesman with the greatest
constructive contributions in the 20th century. His role in China's
modernization drive was unmeasurable, he said.
Hong Kong's return to China showed the rise of China's international
status and will enhance China's all-round national strength.
He believed that Taiwan will be eventually reunified with the
motherland in a peaceful way.
