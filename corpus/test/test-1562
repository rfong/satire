Shalikashvili Visits Haiti, One Week Before Crucial Elections
The United States' top general met Sunday with President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, on a brief visit before crucial legislative elections that
will test the success of the U.S. intervention in Haiti.
Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, also
lunched with U.S. troops and met with of the U.N. military mission that
took over from the U.S.-led multinational force on March 31.
On the five-hour trip, Shalikashvili met Aristide at his private
residence in suburban Tabarre, but the two men did not talk to
reporters afterward.
``Your presence here is very helpful. You are helping one of the
poorest countries,'' the general told soldiers he visited at War Eagle
base, on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince.
``This is the first time, they have had an elected president: We are
doing it the right way. You might not be able to do that again in your
lifetime,'' he said
The visit came a week before June 25 local and legislative elections,
when the U.N. mission will ensure security with Haitian police.
About 10,500 candidates from 26 parties are contesting more than 2,000
elected posts.
A successful election will justify President Clinton's much-disputed
decision, after much hesitation, to intervene to restore Aristide to
power.
``Haiti now has the opportunity to carry out its first genuine,
democratic election since the 1990 contest that brought President
Aristide to power,'' stated a Human Rights Watch Americas report
released Sunday.
It stressed the need ``to assure the integrity of the electoral process
as it enters the more emotionally charged period of campaigning and
balloting.''
There have been a few scattered incidents of pre-election violence,
unlike in 1990 and 1987, when after months of bloodshed the general
elections were aborted with a massacre at the polls.
Last September, a U.S.-led multinational force intervened to disarm and
dismantle the army, which had ousted Aristide in a bloody coup three
years earlier and brutalized the population. Some 4,000 Aristide
supporters were killed.
The intervention peaked at 20,000 members, but never met any
resistance. Aristide was flown home in triumph Oct. 15.
Aristide opposed U.S. plans to rehabilitate the Haitian army and
dissolved it in January. But an internationally-trained permanent
police force is currently being trained at a U.S.-financed police
academy.
Aristide recently said he hoped the police force would number 6,000 by
next February, when the U.N. mission is scheduled to pull out.
Shalikashvili last visited Haiti several days before the transfer of to
the U.N. force, which is led by U.S. Maj. Gen. Joseph Kinzer.
