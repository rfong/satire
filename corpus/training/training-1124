World Conference on Breast Cancer Held in Canada 
The first World Conference on Breast Cancer began its first day of
official meeting today in the Canadian city of Kingston, focusing on
research and medical treatment of the disease.
The participants exchanged information on the latest findings by
leading researchers in the areas of risk factors, prevention, diagnosis
and treatment.
The five-day conference has attracted more than 500 people from across
the world, bringing together survivors, scientists, physicians and
health care workers
During the meeting, they will discuss interdisciplinary cooperation in
the fight against breast cancer, identify cost-effective and
collaborative research opportunities, and galvanize political action
for the fight of breast cancer.
"Most important, the conference will allow the voices of survivors to
be heard and their medical, social, personal and spiritual needs to be
addressed," organizers of the event said.
"The conference will focus international attention on the needs of
women with breast cancer and establish a framework for co-ordinated
global action to eradicate the disease," Conference President Karen
Weisbaum stressed.
It is estimated that every 12 minutes, one woman in North America dies
of breast cancer -- a leading cause of death among women between the
ages of 35 and 55.
This year, more than one million women will die of breast cancer around
the world, the organizers said.
