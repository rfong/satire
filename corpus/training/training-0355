Yeltsin Renominates Kiriyenko as Prime Minister 
President Boris Yeltsin on Friday officially renominated Sergei
Kiriyenko as his candidate for prime minister for a third round vote,
ITAR-TASS news agency reported.
The president ordered Kremlin officials to resubmit Kiriyenko's
nomination after the State Duma refused to confirm his nomination for
the second time in a vote earlier.
