Malaysian police confirm arrest of World Trade Center blast suspect 
Malaysian police Wednesday confirmed that a new suspect in the 1993
bombing of New York's World Trade Center was arrested here before being
extradited to New York.
Police spokesman Superintendent Ghazali Mohd Amin confirmed the arrest
of Wali Khan Amin Shah here, but would not give details.
"Malaysian police cannot release details yet. It is highly
confidential." Ghazali told AFP, adding that more information would be
released in the next few days.
Reports from New York said the suspect, Wali Khan, was indicted there
Tuesday in connection with the February 26, 1993 blast, which killed
six people and injured 1,000.
The reports said Wali Khan was allegedly linked to Ramzi Yousef, who is
also awaiting trial in connection with the bombing of the New York
landmark.
The new suspect is also alleged to have taken part in a Philippines
Airlines blast last December which killed a Japanese man and injured 10
others during a flight between Tokyo and Manila.
Yousef, also linked to the December 11 plane attack, was arrested in
Pakistan in February before being brought to the United States.
Four men convicted in the World Trade Center blast -- Mohammed Salameh,
Nidal Ayyad, Mahmud Abouhalima and Ahmad Ajaj -- were each sentenced in
May 1994 to 240 years in prison.
Another suspect, a Jordanian of Palestinian origin, Iyad Mahmoud Ismal
Najem, 26, was extradited from Jordan to the United States on August 3.
His trial, as well as Ramzi Yousef's, is scheduled for next year.
The trade centre bombing, according to the United States government,
was part of a conspiracy to launch an urban war against the US.
Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and nine others were convicted
October 1 for plotting to bomb New York landmarks and kill political
figures.
The sheik faces a possible life sentence and his accomplices up to 30
years when their sentences are out in January.
