Clinton blasts House juvenile crime bill 
US President Bill Clinton blasted on Thursday a bill that toughens
penalties on juvenile offenders charged in the US federal system,
saying it failed to address the problem of youth crime.
"I oppose (the bill) because it fails to provide a comprehensive plan
to crack down on youth and gang violence," Clinton said in a statement
issued here during an official visit.
Clinton listed measures he said were required to bring down juvenile
crime, including a "war on gangs"; extension of existing gun control
laws; mandating a "safety lock" on guns; and programs that "keep young
people off the street and out of trouble."
The House of Representatives' bill, passed earlier Thursday, "fails to
provide any of these necessary measures to give law enforcement,
prosecutors, and parents the tools they need to combat gangs and youth
violence in their communities," Clinton said.
The Republican-sponsored bill says that fourteen-year-olds will be
prosecuted as adults when charged in the federal system with violent
crimes and drug offenses.
The bill -- passed 286-132 -- also grants states 1.5 billion dollars
over three years to build facilities to jail juvenile offenders and
hire additional prosecutors.
While the bill would prosecute juveniles as adults only under the
federal system, many US states have already passed similar laws.
Opposition to the bill came from Democrats who said the measure did not
do enough to prevent crime, instead focusing on putting juveniles
behind bars.
