Mayor Polishes His Image, But Luster Fades In Jersey City
Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City was campaigning the other night
before some supporters of Ross Perot in the affluent suburb of Wayne.
The crowd was all white, mostly middle-age and generally cranky. ``If
we win this fight, we change things forever,'' the mayor said,
repeating a sales pitch honed during months of barnstorming across New
Jersey.
Schundler spoke with the eloquence that has made him a much-ballyhooed
figure in national Republican circles. But had they been there, many of
his constituents might have considered the talk less notable for its
conservative themes than for its location: once again, the mayor of
Jersey City was not in Jersey City. Once again, he was pushing his
agenda to outsiders.
And he is not even running for office, though his critics may argue
otherwise.
He was in Wayne to drum up interest in his proposal for a program of
school vouchers for Jersey City, which would have to be approved by the
Legislature.
A few times a week, he has touched down in towns across the state,
hoping to convince sometimes skeptical local residents to lobby their
representatives on behalf of his economically depressed city of
229,000.
It is a crusade that like the mayor himself, has begun to draw
increasingly pointed attacks back home.
Schundler may be the darling of the pundits who champion him as proof
that Republicans can conquer urban areas with large minority
populations. But in Jersey City itself, a place of such factionalism
and corruption that no one has been elected mayor to two consecutive
full terms since the 1940s, it appears that the Schundler star no
longer rises.
His former supporters complain that he devotes too much time to
burnishing his national reputation by giving speeches and taking part
in conferences.
They maintain that he is pursuing policies like school vouchers or tax
credits for health care that are too conservative for a historically
Democratic city or are best left to higher-ranking officials.
``There is just so much that he has done to kill his credibility
here,'' said Melissa Holloway, 33, a City Council member who was once
an ally of the mayor but is now an opponent. ``It got to the point
where we would have to turn on CNN on the weekend to find out where
Bret was.''
Schundler, 35, won a four-year term last year with 69 percent of the
vote, six months after a triumph in a special election to fill the term
of Mayor Gerald McCann, who had been convicted of fraud. The victories
were startling because only 6 percent of the city's registered voters
are Republican.
Even now, Schundler is applauded in Jersey City for one of his first
successes, reducing property taxes, which have been among the highest
in the state.
He cut the municipal budget and raised revenue by employing a novel
method of turning property tax liens into securities, an innovation
that reflected his experience on Wall Street.
People praise the mayor's intellect and energy, yet many also feel that
he enjoys attending Cato Institute retreats on the Cayman Islands more
than getting to know the residents of Martin Luther King Drive.
Some suspect that the mayor, a Democrat until 1991, is too ambitious to
remain long in Jersey City, which is why he travels to so many speaking
engagements and courts Republican luminaries like Jack Kemp and Newt
Gingrich.
The national scrutiny Jersey City has received since Schundler took
over also appears to grate on many residents. They say they sometimes
detect a condescending tone implying that the people could not govern
themselves -- that they had to turn to a Harvard-educated, Adam
Smith-citing yuppie who has lived in the city only since the mid-1980s.
Miss Holloway and two other Council members say that Schundler would
lose an election if it were held now. Most of the rest of the
nine-member Council -- all Democrats elected on Schundler's ticket in a
nonpartisan race -- say he would face a battle.
Of the four minority Council members who were once his allies, Miss
Holloway and Jaime Vasquez are now hostile. Another, L. Harvey Smith,
is lukewarm at best.
