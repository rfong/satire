Sri Lanka Initiates Primary Education Reforms 
Reforms in primary education are implemented in Sri Lanka's state
schools from Friday, which aim at identifying each child as an
individual to introduce them to the formal educational system to suit
their own individuality.
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga said in a statement that the
reforms would bring about changes in developing mental abilities,
general basic abilities and healthy attitudes and values in children.
Teachers have already been trained to be creative in order to implement
the reforms. They are expected to monitor the performance of the
children both individually and collectively in games and other
activities, Education Ministry sources said.
Fourteen games have been identified to suit the grade 1 children. The
teachers will observe the students and identify their skills
competencies and behavioral patterns when they participate in these
games. It will also enable the teacher to identify mental and physical
strengths of the children.
In a fact finding mission it was found that by using environment
successfully teachers had managed to create learning situations and
environmental friendly attitudes and arouse curiosity among the
children.
The new curriculum comprises language, religion, mathematics and
environment based activities. It is a competency based curriculum with
a mixture of knowledge, competencies, attitudes and values.
The new reforms envisage employing one teacher for two years at one key
stage. This is expected to make it easier for the teacher to help the
children to master competencies in learning.
