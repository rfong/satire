Off With Her Head! Vandal Decapitates Nude Queen Elizabeth 
Taking a royal prerogative into his own hands, a commoner has beheaded
the queen. The controversial nude statue of Queen Elizabeth II was
decapitated overnight, police said Friday.
The nude Prince Philip statue seated beside her on a park bench on the
shore of Lake Burley Griffin was believed intact, though Australian
monarchists have denounced the entire artwork as thoroughly tactless.
A conservative anti-republican lobby group, Australians for a
Constitutional Monarchy, has described the work, entitled ``Liz and
Phil by the Lake'' as offensive, puerile and motivated by politics not
art.
``The queen is the head of state. This is her national capital and they
put a sculpture of her to hold her up to ridicule,'' said the group's
spokesman Alan Fitzgerald, on Thursday.
Sculptor Greg Taylor said the statues symbolize the irrelevance of
Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip for Australians who want a
republic.
Prime Minister Paul Keating plans to replace the monarch with an
Australian president by 2001.
Local government officials, who authorized the display as part of a
city-wide sculpture exhibition, say most people approve.
Australia is an independent country. But like other former British
colonies, such as Canada and New Zealand, retains the monarch as head
of state.
Keating argues that the declaration of a republic will help redefine
Australia's place in the world and especially in neighboring Asia.
