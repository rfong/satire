Kabul's only orphanage battles for survival after Taliban take-over
Twelve-year-old Naqibullah wanders through the gloomy and battered
concrete corridors of Kabul's last remaining orphanage in search of an
extra mouthful of rice and lentils.
"There isn't much food anymore and we usually go to bed feeling
hungry," he said, describing the changes he and other orphans have had
to come to terms with since the Islamic Taliban militia captured Kabul
a month ago.
The boy, whose parents were killed in a rocket attack here two years
ago, says he also misses the care and comfort of his female minders,
most of whom he has not seen since the Taliban announced a strict ban
on women working shortly after seizing the Afghan capital.
"It's got boring because we have no-one to look after us, talk to us or
play games with us anymore," added the slight, dark-eyed youngster,
wearing a pair of worn jeans and a blue sweater.
Children, many of them slightly grubby because of the sudden lack of
staff to bathe them, run wild through the orphanage's pock-marked
halls, which now reek faintly of urine from the over-flowing communal
bathrooms.
Nearby, a group of toddlers huddle on a length of plastic sheeting to
eat their lunch, sharing -- two children to one dented aluminium plate
-- a meal of stodgy rice and lentils.
Staff say meat, fruit and even bread have been dropped from the
children's diets as the orphanage can no longer afford such luxuries
since Kabul's new Taliban government stopped funding the home.
The orphanage's 850 residents, mostly victims of Afghanistan's
four-year-old civil war, now face a grim winter as the cold begins to
take its grip on the city, the home's acting head, Abu Moslem Mukhtar,
told AFP.
"Since the Taliban arrived here we have not received a penny from the
government, which has caused us a serious problem," he said.
"We are battling to do the best we can, but conditions are very tough.
We see a very harsh and dark winter lurking on the horizon if we can't
solve this problem quickly."
Unless the orphanage soon receives firewood for cooking and diesel for
its heaters -- as well as food to replenish dwindling stocks -- the
children risk enduring a winter which could make them victims of
malnutrition, exposure and disease, Mukhtar said.
The orphanage was totally funded by the government of deposed president
Burhanuddin Rabbani, until his administration collapsed and fled as the
Taliban Islamic warriors advanced on Kabul.
The new fundamentalist regime, which is preoccupied with fending off a
major counter-attack from the former government, appears to have
ignored it and, having told working women to stay at home, left the
orphanage with only a meagre skeleton staff.
Some 336 of its 436 staff -- 75 percent of whom are female -- no longer
show up for work, leaving 96 men and four defiant women to care for 850
youngsters -- without any salaries, Mukhtar said.
"We no longer have enough people to care for and supervise the
children, to cook for them, to wash them and their clothes and to clean
the building," he added.
"We have asked the Taliban ruling council to assume their
responsibility and to give us funds and let our women work.
"I fear, however, that all funds and energies now go towards defence
and running the government. If we don't get help soon, it will be
catastrophic."
Other staff agreed a crisis would develop unless help comes fast.
"Something must be done or else these kids will be in a tragic state by
the end of the winter," said Zubeida, a 40-year-old woman who has
defied the Taliban ban on women working to care for her young wards.
"I've hardly been home for the last month and work day and night, but
we have to do what we can for these children who have already suffered
so much."
Many of the home's residents -- who are among an estimated hundreds of
thousands of war orphans here -- lost either one or both parents during
the last 17 years of almost constant conflict in Afghanistan.
Scores of the youngsters are still traumatised by the horror they have
often witnessed, leaping for cover at the sound of a slamming door in a
city which has been free of fighting since the Taliban take-over.
