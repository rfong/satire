For/IN some/DT time/NN ,/, D'Amato/RB himself/PRP toyed/VBD with/IN running/VBG for/IN governor/NN ,/, and/CC many/JJ politicians/NNS said/VBD he/PRP coveted/VBD the/DT job/NN because/IN it/PRP ,/, more/RBR than/IN any/DT other/JJ ,/, is/VBZ the/DT center/NN of/IN political/JJ and/CC patronage/NN power/NN in/IN the/DT state/NN -LRB-/-LRB- with/IN about/RB 3,800/CD appointments/NNS under/IN the/DT governor/NN 's/POS control/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, and/CC D'Amato/NNP cut/VBD his/PRP$ teeth/NNS in/IN the/DT Nassau/NNP County/NNP Republican/JJ machine/NN where/WRB patronage/NN was/VBD a/DT way/NN of/IN life/NN ./.

Then/RB ,/, as/IN he/PRP began/VBD sounding/VBG out/RP relatively/RB obscure/JJ figures/NNS like/IN Pataki/NNP ,/, speculation/NN grew/VBD that/IN he/PRP did/VBD not/RB really/RB want/VB the/DT party/NN to/TO win/VB the/DT governorship/NN after/IN all/DT ,/, since/IN that/DT could/MD mean/VB a/DT threat/NN to/TO him/PRP ./.

But/CC once/IN he/PRP threw/VBD himself/PRP behind/IN Pataki/NNP 's/POS candidacy/NN ,/, he/PRP did/VBD so/RB wholeheartedly/JJ ,/, lending/VBG aides/NNS and/CC trying/VBG to/TO transfer/VB $/$ 400,000/CD in/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ campaign/NN funds/NNS ,/, until/IN a/DT court/NN ruled/VBD that/IN far/RB exceeded/VBD legal/JJ contribution/NN limits/NNS ./.

D'Amato/NNP has/VBZ warned/VBN allies/NNS of/IN Marino/NNP ,/, the/DT State/NNP Senate/NNP Republican/NNP leader/NN ,/, that/IN his/PRP$ days/NNS are/VBP numbered/VBN because/IN he/PRP tried/VBD to/TO block/VB Pataki/NNP 's/POS candidacy/NN in/IN favor/NN of/IN London/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ running/VBG for/IN comptroller/NN instead/RB in/IN a/DT deal/NN brokered/VBN by/IN D'Amato/NNP and/CC Michael/NNP Long/NNP ,/, the/DT chairman/NN of/IN the/DT state/NN Conservative/JJ Party/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT rumor/NN was/VBD he/PRP just/RB wanted/VBD to/TO keep/VB it/PRP open/JJ for/IN himself/PRP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Long/NNP ,/, a/DT longtime/JJ D'Amato/NNP ally/NN who/WP has/VBZ occasionally/RB feuded/VBN with/IN him/PRP ,/, too/RB ./.

``/`` Well/UH ,/, that/DT 's/VBZ been/VBN proven/VBN wrong/JJ ./.

He/PRP deserves/VBZ to/TO have/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN kudos/NNS if/IN we/PRP 're/VBP successful/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP he/PRP deserves/VBZ to/TO have/VB a/DT very/RB strong/JJ power/NN base/NN ./. ''/''

Gov./NNP Nelson/NNP Rockefeller/NNP played/VBD a/DT similar/JJ role/NN of/IN patron/NN to/TO Mayor/NNP John/NNP Lindsay/NNP ,/, but/CC fell/VBD to/TO bitter/JJ feuding/NN when/WRB he/PRP thought/VBD Lindsay/NNP was/VBD not/RB adequately/RB grateful/JJ ./.

The/DT two/CD appointed/VBD dueling/JJ commissions/NNS to/TO poke/VB into/IN each/DT other/JJ 's/POS government/NN performance/NN ,/, and/CC at/IN one/CD point/NN ,/, Rockefeller/NNP threatened/VBD to/TO send/VB the/DT National/NNP Guard/NNP to/TO pick/VB up/RP the/DT trash/NN in/IN the/DT city/NN during/IN a/DT garbage/NN strike/NN ./.

Pataki/NNP has/VBZ some/DT history/NN of/IN discounting/VBG the/DT wishes/NNS of/IN politicians/NNS who/WP made/VBD him/PRP their/PRP$ protege/NN ./.

He/PRP was/VBD elected/VBN to/TO the/DT State/NNP Senate/NNP by/IN challenging/VBG Mary/NNP Goodhue/NNP ,/, his/PRP$ old/JJ boss/NN and/CC the/DT lone/JJ Republican/JJ woman/NN in/IN the/DT chamber/NN ./.

The/DT relationship/NN with/IN Giuliani/NNP is/VBZ also/RB complex/JJ ./.

The/DT city/NN badly/RB needs/VBZ state/NN aid/NN that/WDT could/MD be/VB curtailed/VBN if/IN Pataki/NNP cuts/VBZ spending/NN ./.

Giuliani/NNP did/VBD not/RB support/VB Pataki/NNP 's/POS candidacy/NN and/CC has/VBZ yet/RB to/TO endorse/VB him/PRP ,/, and/CC the/DT two/CD men/NNS have/VBP different/JJ geo-political/JJ bases/NNS and/CC perhaps/RB conflicting/VBG ambitions/NNS ./.

``/`` If/IN George/NNP Pataki/NNP wins/VBZ ,/, but/CC only/RB barely/RB falls/VBZ across/RP the/DT finish/NN line/NN because/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ party/NN was/VBD n't/RB united/VBN ,/, I/PRP could/MD imagine/VB there/EX 'd/MD be/VB some/DT anger/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD City/NNP Councilman/NNP Charles/NNP B./NNP Millard/NNP ,/, the/DT Republican/JJ nominee/NN for/IN Congress/NNP on/IN the/DT Upper/NNP East/NNP Side/NN ./.
