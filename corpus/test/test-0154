Early Elections Set for May 21 
Parliamentary elections will be held on May 21, half a year ahead of
schedule because the center-left coalition is no longer able to take
tough economic measures, the government announced Monday.
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said last Friday early elections were
necessary before the summer so that a new government would be able to
approve a stringent 1996 budget, unimpeded by immediate electoral
concerns. But he gave no exact date at that stage.
The parties had also considered June 11, but decided against it because
the electoral campaign would be in full flow while Pope John Paul II is
in the country for a two-day visit June 3-4.
