Vietnam attracts Taiwanese interest in mail-order brides 
Vietnam is becoming a thriving centre for mail-order brides for
Taiwanese men who pay around 3,000 dollars to buy a young wife in Ho
Chi Minh City, according to a newspaper report published Monday.
Phu Nu, a newspaper published by the Ho Chi Minh City Women's Union,
complained that Taiwanese men were increasingly coming to Vietnam on
tours during which they were introduced to potential brides.
The newspaper said 35 of 45 marriages involving foreigners in one
district of Ho Chi Minh City were between Vietnamese and Taiwanese and
that most had been arranged by intermediaries.
Taiwanese men paid around 3,000 dollars for a wife, half of which went
to unscrupulous intermediaries, the newspaper said.
Dang Cong Khanh, a police officer quoted in the article, said that it
was rare to see wealthy Taiwanese coming to find wives and that most
were poor farmers, the handicapped or the elderly "who are almost at
death's door."
"With just a few thousand dollars, Taiwanese men cannot find wives at
home but that sum of money represents a fortune to some young
Vietnamese women," the police officer said.
Mothers were selling off daughters as young as 16 years old to pay off
family debts, the newspaper said, adding that the price of a bride had
fallen markedly from several years ago when one cost around 7,000
dollars.
Phu Nu called on the authorities to find some way of distinguishing
between genuine marriages and those by Taiwanese men who "just want to
buy a slave, a plaything or a prostitute."
The issue of women sold into prostitution has become a major problem in
Vietnam with women's organisations estimating that some 5,000 women
have been sent overseas to work in the sex industry.
Women are often lured to China or other countries with promises of work
only to find themselves enslaved as prostitutes. Four men were arrested
at the beginning of the year after being caught selling women for as
little as 1.3 million dong (110 dollars).
