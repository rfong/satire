(changing dateline) Russia finds no thefts at nuclear installations 
Russia's atomic energy ministry said Monday that, despite burgeoning
security fears, it had no knowledge of any thefts from its
installations of radioactive substances that could be used to make
atomic bombs.
"We checked our nuclear sites and we haven't found a single
disappearance of materials such as plutonium 239 or uranium 235,"
ministry spokesman Georgi Kaurov told AFP.
The verification was carried out at the request of German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, said Kaurov.
The only theft was of non-enriched uranium, used as fuel for nuclear
reactors, but with no military use, the spokesman said.
Kohl had written to President Boris Yeltsin to "ask him to reinforce
security" in Russian nuclear installations, he said.
Fears about Russian nuclear security snowballed following the
confiscation by German police in Munich on August 10 of a record haul
of more than 100 grammes of weapons-grade plutonium 239 on a plane from
Moscow.
The haul, reported at the weekend, was the latest of several seizures
of radioactive substances in Germany.
Kaurov said there is no evidence of Russian nuclear negligence. He
called such accusations "perhaps a campaign of provocation."
He said Russian experts wanted to examine the seized materials to
determine if they could have come from Russian sources.
Meanwhile, a top aide to Kohl said Monday he would go to Russia soon to
find ways of combatting smuggling of radioactive materials.
Bernd Schmidbauer, the chief of staff of the chancellery, told the
daily newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt that Bonn would share its
information about the traffic and on the substances recently seized in
Germany. He said Russia was cooperating with his efforts.
Schmidbauer said Germany would also if necessary work with Ukraine and
Kazakhstan, two other ex-Soviet republics with nuclear capabilities.
Until now, the potential buyers of radioactive materials for military
use "have apparently not been successful in getting possession of these
substances," Schmidbauer said.
