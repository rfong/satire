--/: After/IN making/VBG historic/JJ gains/NNS in/IN Congress/NNP two/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, Hispanics/NNPS are/VBP just/RB hoping/VBG to/TO hang/VB onto/IN the/DT seats/NNS they/PRP have/VBP in/IN Tuesday/NNP 's/POS elections/NNS ./.

Redrawing/NN of/IN the/DT political/JJ map/NN ,/, the/DT public/NN 's/POS thirst/NN for/IN change/NN and/CC a/DT high/JJ number/NN of/IN open/JJ seats/NNS combined/VBD to/TO boost/VB Hispanic/JJ membership/NN in/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Representatives/NNPS from/IN 11/CD to/TO a/DT record/JJ 17/CD in/IN 1992/CD ./.

The/DT jump/NN gave/VBD the/DT nation/NN 's/POS second/JJ largest/JJS minority/NN a/DT stronger/JJR voice/NN on/IN national/JJ issues/NNS ./.

Hispanics/NNPS are/VBP still/RB underrepresented/VBN in/IN Congress/NNP compared/VBN to/TO their/PRP$ percentage/NN of/IN the/DT population/NN ./.

They/PRP number/NN 22.4/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC about/RB 9/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP population/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP hold/VBP only/RB 4/CD percent/NN of/IN House/NNP seats/NNS ./.

There/EX are/VBP no/DT Hispanics/NNPS in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP Senate/NNP ./.

Redistricting/VBG after/IN the/DT 1990/CD Census/NNS created/VBD a/DT record/JJ 20/CD Hispanic-majority/NNP congressional/JJ districts/NNS ./.

Political/NNP observers/NNS say/VBP that/IN is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT best/JJS showing/NN Hispanic/JJ candidates/NNS will/MD enjoy/VB for/IN years/NNS ./.

``/`` The/DT redistricting/NN really/RB created/VBN contests/VBZ where/WRB Hispanics/NNPS had/VBD a/DT good/JJ chance/NN of/IN winning/VBG ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Robert/NNP Brischetto/NNP ,/, executive/JJ director/NN of/IN the/DT Southwest/NNP Voter/NNP Research/NNP Institute/NNP ,/, which/WDT studies/VBZ Hispanic/JJ voting/NN trends/NNS ./.

``/`` Now/RB the/DT question/NN is/VBZ trying/VBG to/TO protect/VB these/DT incumbents/NNS ./. ''/''

Despite/IN the/DT public/NN 's/POS dissatisfaction/NN with/IN incumbents/NNS ,/, particularly/RB Democrats/NNPS ,/, this/DT year/NN ,/, analysts/NNS expect/VBP most/JJS Hispanics/NNS in/IN Congress/NNP to/TO be/VB re-elected/VBN ./.

All/DT but/CC three/CD Hispanic/JJ lawmakers/NNS are/VBP Democrats/NNS and/CC all/DT but/CC two/CD represent/NNS majority-Hispanic/JJ districts/NNS ./.

Traditionally/RB ,/, 80/CD percent/NN of/IN Mexican/JJ Americans/NNS have/VBP voted/VBN for/IN Democrats/NNPS ,/, and/CC most/JJS people/NNS favor/VBP candidates/NNS of/IN the/DT same/JJ ethnic/JJ background/NN ,/, said/VBD Mark/NNP Brimhall/NNP ,/, a/DT researcher/NN for/IN the/DT National/NNP Association/NNP of/IN Latino/NNP Elected/NNP and/CC Appointed/JJ Officials/NNS ./.

``/`` The/DT mid-term/JJ elections/NNS are/VBP never/RB a/DT strength/NN for/IN anyone/NN ,/, ''/'' Brimhall/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` We/PRP do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB any/DT real/JJ gains/NNS ,/, but/CC we/PRP expect/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN incumbents/NNS to/TO do/VB very/RB well/RB ./. ''/''

The/DT most-endangered/NN Hispanic/NNP incumbent/JJ is/VBZ Rep./NNP Henry/NNP Bonilla/NNP ,/, R-San/NNP Antonio/NNP ,/, the/DT first/JJ Mexican-American/NNP Republican/NNP elected/VBN to/TO the/DT House/NNP ./.

Bonilla/NNP 's/POS race/NN has/VBZ attracted/VBN publicity/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, because/IN his/PRP$ challenger/NN ,/, Democrat/NNP Rolando/NNP Rios/NNP ,/, also/RB is/VBZ Hispanic/JJ ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT incumbents/NNS ,/, 12/CD Hispanics/NNPS are/VBP running/VBG for/IN House/NNP seats/NNS in/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT two/CD major/JJ parties/NNS ,/, according/VBG to/TO NALEO/NNP ./.

Also/RB ,/, Republican/NNP Bernadette/NNP Castro/NNP is/VBZ challenging/VBG Sen./NNP Daniel/NNP Patrick/NNP Moynihan/NNP ,/, D-N.Y./NNP ,/, but/CC she/PRP is/VBZ not/RB expected/VBN to/TO win/VB ./.

Only/RB two/CD Hispanics/NNPS have/VBP ever/RB served/VBN in/IN the/DT Senate/NNP ./.

All/DT but/CC two/CD of/IN the/DT Hispanic/JJ challengers/NNS are/VBP Republicans/NNS ,/, a/DT sign/NN that/IN the/DT GOP/NNP is/VBZ recognizing/VBG the/DT value/NN of/IN Hispanic/JJ candidates/NNS and/CC the/DT community/NN 's/POS needs/NNS ,/, Brischetto/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Republicans/NNPS have/VBP wised/VBN up/RP to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP can/MD cut/VB a/DT piece/NN off/IN the/DT traditional/JJ Democratic/JJ voting/NN bloc/NN ,/, ''/'' Brischetto/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` That/DT 's/VBZ why/WRB they/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN running/VBG Hispanics/NNPS and/CC been/VBN willing/JJ to/TO put/VB money/NN behind/IN them/PRP ./. ''/''

At/IN the/DT state/NN and/CC local/JJ level/NN ,/, the/DT number/NN of/IN Hispanic/JJ elected/JJ officials/NNS is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO rise/VB between/IN 3/CD and/CC 5/CD percent/NN ,/, said/VBD Harry/NNP Pachon/NNP ,/, director/NN of/IN the/DT Tomas/NNP Rivera/NNP Center/NNP in/IN Claremont/NNP ,/, Calif./NNP ./.

There/EX are/VBP about/IN 5,000/CD Hispanic/JJ elected/JJ officials/NNS nationwide/RB ./.

These/DT candidates/NNS are/VBP gaining/VBG the/DT experience/NN they/PRP need/VBP to/TO move/VB up/RP to/TO national/JJ office/NN in/IN the/DT coming/VBG years/NNS ,/, Pachon/NNP said/VBD ,/, adding/VBG that/IN term/NN limit/NN initiatives/NNS in/IN many/JJ states/NNS are/VBP opening/VBG opportunities/NNS for/IN Hispanics/NNPS and/CC other/JJ candidates/NNS without/IN legislative/JJ experience/NN ./.

Pachon/NNP predicted/VBD Hispanics/NNPS will/MD make/VB gains/NNS in/IN coming/VBG years/NNS and/CC approach/VB true/JJ representation/NN ./.

A/DT recent/JJ Census/NNP Bureau/NNP study/NN projected/VBD that/IN Hispanics/NNPS will/MD become/VB the/DT nation/NN 's/POS largest/JJS minority/NN by/IN the/DT year/NN 2010/CD ,/, when/WRB their/PRP$ population/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO top/JJ 40/CD million/CD ./.

``/`` The/DT community/NN has/VBZ some/DT distance/NN to/TO go/VB for/IN real/JJ empowerment/NN ,/, ''/'' Pachon/NNP said/VBD ./.
