Controversial verdict overshadows superlative Lara
A controversial vedict by umpire Mervyn Kitchen threatened to overshadow a
superlative innings from Brian Lara as West Indies took command against
India on the fourth day of the first cricket Test at Sabina Park here
Sunday.
Kitchen, an English umpire standing alongside Steve Bucknor, failed to
call upon third umpire Johnny Gayle for a decision on an Indian appeal
for run out against Carl Hooper when he was two.
A delivery from leg-spin bowler Anil Kumble was steered to short third
man by Roland Holder and Hooper tried to steal a run.
Television replays appeared to show that Navjot Sidhu's direct hit at
the bowler's end had struck the stumps with the toe of Hooper's bat
three to six inches short of the mark.
Umpire Kitchen's not out decision was given based upon the evidence of
his naked eye -- but clearly he should have consulted umpire Gayle.
West Indies were 207 for four at the time and Hooper's dismissal could
have brought another twist to what has been an entertaining match.
Having gained a first innings lead of 81 by dismissing India for 346,
West Indies, helped on their way by a superb 78 from Lara, were 241 for
four at the close.
Hooper, unbeaten on 12, and Roland Holder, 21 not out, had refused the
umpires offer for bad light at 5:45 p.m. (local time) when West Indies
were 207 for four, but Bucknor and Kitchen had their way half-hour
later when they decided to be 'safe rather than sorry.'
Lara's marvellous strokeplay had illuminated the ground and brought a
crowd of over 10,000 to its feet. His exciting innings lasted an
hour-and-a-half in which time he smote eight fours and one six off 83
balls.
Before his dismissal, offering a thin edge when he cut at a delivery
from leg-spin bowler Anil Kumble, the gifted left-hander completely
transformed the innings in adding a rapid 135 in almost equal time with
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, whose 48 contained five fours in just over two
hours.
As West Indies tried for quick runs to prompt a declaration either
before the close or early on Monday's final day, Chanderpaul and
Sherwin Campbell, who had shared 68 for the first wicket with Stuart
Williams, had been tied down by Kumble and medium-paced bowler
Venkatesh Prasad after the tea break was adjusted because of two
interruptions for rain that lasted an hour in total.
When Campbell, like his opening partner, was bowled dragging a ball
into his stumps off Kumble, the situation favoured India.
Typically Lara swung the match firmly to the West Indies with a volley
of strokes that shattered the confidence of all the bowlers including
Kumble who watched helplessly as one of his deliveries went for a
massive straight six.
When Lara, who became the last of Kumble's three wickets for 76 runs
off 23 overs and Chanderpaul, caught at cover by Indian captain Sachin
Tendulkar off fast medium bowler Abey Kuruvilla, were dismissed off
successive balls, West Indies were 203 for four but Hooper and Holder
prolonged things for as long as they could to see the lead climb over
300.
Earlier, India gained precious few runs in just over an hour when they
moved from their overnight total of 308 for seven to frustrate West
Indies, who gained the early breakthrough when Nayan Mongia miscued a
hook at a short-ball from fast bowler Courtney Walsh to square leg.
Franklyn Rose, the previous day's star, became the fourth West Indian
to capture six wickets against India at Sabina Park in a Test when he
bowled Kuruvilla off-stump for nought. The fast bowler ended with six
for 100 off 33 overs.
Neither Walsh nor Rose could part Sunil Joshi, whose 43 containing
three fours in just over three hours off 148 balls was his highest
score in Test, and Prasad in the half-hour before the drinks break.
But the West Indies captain turned to Curtly Ambrose and Ian Bishop,
who obliged by making the left-handed Joshi drag a ball into his
off-stump.
