Group-15 Opens 10th Summit in Cairo 
The Group-15 nations opened their 10th summit in Cairo on Monday, which
was attended by seven presidents, one prime minister, three vice
presidents and senior officials from the 17 member states.
During the two-day conference, the participants are expected to discuss
world economic development trends, economic globalization and its
effect on developing countries in particular, elimination of poverty,
reduction of debts, fight against unemployment and activation of joint
projects among the members.
While seeking inter-G-15 economic and trade cooperation, the
organization is expected to forge a common stance calling for a world
economic order that will not limit access of developing countries to
the markets of developed nations.
The summit will also try to convey a message to the Group-8
industrialized nations, namely the United States, Japan, Germany,
France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Russia, calling for their support
for the economic development of the Third World.
The G-15, founded in 1989, comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria,
Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
The G-15 nations account for one third of the world's population and
produce 2 trillion U.S. dollars in goods. Their combined exports last
year stood at 361.4 billion dollars and imports at 357.2 billion
dollars.
