Taliban agree to ceasefire 
The Taliban Islamic militia Monday accepted northern warlord Abdul
Rashid Dostam's proposal for a ceasefire on all Afghan fronts from
mid-day Monday (0700 GMT), a Taliban official said.
The Taliban accepted the proposal on the condition the ceasefire comes
into force with a "simultaneous exchange" of prisoners held by warring
factions, said the official, Mulla Muhammed Haqqani, from the militia's
headquarters in Kandahar in southwest Afghanistan.
The Taliban, however, are not in direct conflict with Doistam's forces
but were battling troops loyal to the former government they ousted
from Kabul on September 27.
Haqqani said Pakistani Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar, who arrived
in Kandahar with Dostam's proposal late Sunday, left for Mazar-i-Sharif
in northern Afghanistan to convey the Taliban's response to Dostam.
The Taliban have also proposed a 12-member commission to monitor the
ceasefire from Monday noon.
The commission would include representatives from the Taliban, Dostam's
National Islamic Movement, the Shiite Hezb-i-Wahdat led by Karim
Khalil, and the former government forces led by Ahmad Shah Masood, he
said.
