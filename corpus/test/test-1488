Ali Mahdi Calls on Somalis To Refrain From Armed 
Somali faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed, at a press conference
yesterday, called on the Somalis to refrain from violence and armed
conflicts, but practice maximum restraint at this crucial moment.
Speaking at his first press conference in north Mogadishu, Ali Mahdi
warned against the consequences which might result from any further
bloodshed in the capital, Mogadishu.
Ali Mahdi denjed that the 26 Somali factions who recently met in
Ethiopia are organizing war against Hussein Aidid and the leader of the
break away Republic of Somaliland, Mohamed Hagi Ibrahim Egal.
He said that the newly founded National Salvation Council has instead
formed two negotiation committees to open peace dialogues with Hussein
Aidid and Egal.
Mahdi said the National Salvation Council will be operating for the
coming six months before going into other round of forming a government
of national unity or a presidential council for somalia.
