Peru government, rebels set to resume talks 
Talks between Peru's government and leftist rebels holding 72 hostages
here were set to resume Monday after breaking off amid guerrilla
charges that the government was digging a tunnel to storm the Japanese
embassy residence.
Nestor Cerpa, leader of the Tupac Amaru rebel group that occupied the
home of the Japanese ambassdor neary three months ago, broke off talks
on Thursday to "denounce the lack of transparency" of the Peruvian
government in the negotiations.
Cerpa accused the government of stalling in the talks while government
forces tried to dig their way into the embassy residence.
Government officials have neither confirmed nor denied reports of the
tunnel's existence.
Rebel demands include freedom for some 440 imprisoned comrades.
Fujimori has said that request is unacceptable but has secured offers
of asylum for the guerrillas in Cuba and the Dominican Republic.
The Tupac Amaru rebels said they had no intention of leaving the
country.
A poll released Monday indicated that nearly 60 percent of Peruvians
disapprove of the way President Alberto Fujimori has handled the
standoff.
A full 76 percent said Fujimori should seek a peaceful end to the
crisis while 21.9 percent supported a "military intervention,"
according to the Compania Peruana de Investigaciones survey.
