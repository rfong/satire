South Africa's first black voter back in New Zealand court 
A black African woman who claimed to be the niece of South African
President Nelson Mandela and was the first to vote in South Africa's
first fully democratic elections, made a brief second appearance in the
Wellington District Court Thursday.
Vuyelwa Nomaza Paintin, 51, who described her occupation as
"homemaker", had last month entered no plea to the charge that on April
25 at Wellington she made a false declaration that she was born in
South Africa, when in fact she had been born in what was then Rhodesia,
now Zimbabwe.
If found guilty she could face a maximum three years in jail, although
people here are seldom jailed for such offences.
On her latest appearance she again made no plea and the case was
adjourned to August 25.
Paintin was the first person to vote in the South African elections
because world time-zones meant a special voting station here was the
first to open.
She was greeted outside the polling venue by Prime Minister Jim Bolger
and pictures of her voting went around the world. Bolger later gave
Mandela a framed copy of the picture.
Two months ago Television New Zealand (TVNZ) revealed her vote had not
counted because she was not South African, but Zimbabwean. It also said
that while Paintin claimed to be a doctor and a diplomat, she was
neither, and that her relationship to Mandela was only very distant.
TVNZ called her a "complete sham" with a long history of fabrication.
Last week Paintin told TVNZ it was not important to her whether the
actual vote had counted or not.
"I was the first person to vote and you can't take that away, and I
voted spiritually for my grandparents and my father. So what everybody
says about it being invalid is not important to me, but I did it, with
great passion."
Although she claimed to have been born in Transkei her mother told TVNZ
she had been born in Harare, Zimbabwe, and had never been to South
Africa.
