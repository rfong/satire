Three Gorges Project and Overseas Investors
The Three Gorges Project, the world's largest hydro-electric project,
has created a huge market for overseas investors.
Since almost one third of the project's investment of 25 billion US
dollars is expected to be used to purchase construction materials,
machinery and equipment.
More than half of the construction equipment in use at the dam site so
far have been imported since the project involves an unparalleled
amount of construction work and the most complicated technologies in
the world.
Beginning today, the Xinhua News Agency will carry a series of six
stories about major equipment-importing contracts the project developer
- the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation
(CYTGPDC) has signed with foreign companies.
The CYTGPDC imported the first lot of construction machinery and
equipment on January 26, 1994 through international bidding, including
bulldozers, graders, loading machines, hydraulic rigs, cranes, and
excavators.
The suppliers, US Caterpillar China Limited, Ingersoll Rand Limited,
Mannesman Demag, Fried Krupp AG, and Sweden Atlas Copco China Limited,
are all the world-renowned machinery producers.
