Peres Hopes for New Israeli-Palestinian Ties (By Xie Dongfeng and Wang Yukui)
Israel and the Palestinians should "convert the Oslo 2 agreement into
new relations" between the two peoples, said Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres here today.
Peres was speaking at a joint press conference along with Yasser
Arafat, newly elected President of the Palestinian Authority, following
their meeting.
The best way for two different peoples to live together is to establish
a good neighborly relationship instead of war and violence, said Peres.
"We should not only devote ourselves to the continuation of the peace
process, but also should devote ourselves to establish a new kind of
relations," he added.
This was the first meeting between the two leaders after Arafat was
elected president on Saturday.
Peres congratulated Arafat on his success in the elections.
The success of the Palestinian elections were "a great promise for us
to go forward with the peace process," said Peres, adding that the
elections have given the world a new image of the Palestinians.
The elections also showed that the majority of the Palestinian people
supports the peace process, he said.
Talking about future steps, Peres demanded that the Palestine National
Council (PNC) abolish clauses in the Palestinian charter which call for
Israel's destruction within two months.
He also promised that the Israel would fulfill its military
redeployment in Hebron by the end of March.
Peres said that both sides would start negotiations on the permanent
status of the occupied territories in May and Israel will begin the
second-phase redeployment in October.
During the meeting, both leaders also discussed the issue of Israel
allowing more Palestinians to work in Israel. Peres told reporters that
Israel would allow 3,000 Palestinians from Hebron to work in Israel.
However, Peres warned that the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
should do more to combat anti-Israeli attacks by Islamic extremists in
order not to "complicate the situation."
In his turn, Arafat told reporters that the meeting was "fruitful and
positive."
He pledged that the PNA will work with the Israeli government to
strengthen relations between the two sides, not only between the
political leaders, but also between the masses.
The Palestinian leader also expressed his hope for breakthrough in
Israel's peace negotiations with Syria and Lebanon so that there will
be a lasting and just peace in the region.
When asked about his recent remarks about establishing a Palestinian
state within one to one and half years, Arafat said he and Peres did
not discuss this issue.
Nevertheless, Arafat said "It's my right to dream," expressing the hope
that this goal could be achieved.
In response, Peres said that "dream should be one-sided, but an
agreement must be two-sided."
During today's meeting, Peres and Arafat held face-to-face talks for
half an hour and were later joined by officials from both sides.
Among those attending the meeting were Nabil Shaath and Jamil Tarifi,
who are both newly elected members of the Palestinian Council, Israeli
Knesset (parliament) speaker Shevach Weiss and Uzi Dayan, head of the
Planning Branch of the Israeli army.
