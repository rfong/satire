Ross to start new visit on Monday: Netanyahu 
US peace envoy Dennis Ross is due to arrive Monday in Jerusalem in his
latest bid to revive stalled peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, Israeli radio said Friday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the date during his
government's weekly cabinet meeting on Friday, the radio said.
The visit will be Ross' second in a month aimed at drawing the two
sides back to negotiations, which have been halted since Israel broke
ground on a new Jewish settlement in annexed Arab east Jerusalem in
mid-March.
The US State Department announced Thursday that Ross would be making a
visit to the area early next week without specifying a day.
