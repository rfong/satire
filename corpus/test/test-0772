Brazilian stocks plunge, government reassures investors 
Brazilian stocks plunged nearly 10 percent Tuesday amid fears that the
Mexican financial crisis could spill over to Brazil despite reassuring
comments from the government and the financial community.
Planning Minister Jose Serra said the government was "not alarmed or
worried" about the drop, saying the decline was due to "many factors,
including psychological nature."
The Sao Paulo Bovespa index fell 9.8 percent after a 5.2 percent
decline Monday.
Manoel Pires da Costa, president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange said
traders were nervous in the wake of rumors of financial instability in
Brazil, which he said were "totally baseless."
Pires said there was no reason to believe rumors that the government
was unable to meet its obligations, but added that traders were
concerned about international investors withdrawing funds from Brazil,
which could exacerbate losses.
"I personally feel those fears are wrong, because the outflow of funds
is not proportional to the drop in stocks," Pires said.
Serra said meanwhile in Brasilia that "the situation in Brazil is much
more solid than that of Mexico," adding, "our economy is stable."
Mexican stocks nosedived more than 11 percent Tuesday as more investors
pulled funds from the country.
The Mexican peso plunged by one-third following a December 20 decision
to allow the currency to float. The government responded by
implementing a program of wage and price restraints although the sharp
devaluation still threatens to send inflation soaring and slash
Mexico's economic growth rates.
