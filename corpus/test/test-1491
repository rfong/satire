Pavel Wins Japan Open Tennis Title 
Romanian Andrei Pavel, ranked 109th in the world, won his first ATP
tour title Sunday as he beat Zimbabwe's Byron Black 6-3, 6-4 in the
Japan Open tennis final.
Japan's Ai Sugiyama defended her women's title, overcoming American
Corina Morariu 6-3, 6-3.
No. 16 seed Pavel, in his first tour final, needed just an hour to the
10th seeded rival.
After an early exchange of breaks, Pavel broke again for a 4-2 lead in
the first set.
He gained the decisive break for a 5-4 lead in the second, scoring with
an overhead after a long rally, a forehand down the line, a winning
volley set up with a ripping crosscourt backhand, and a net charge
against a second serve.
The Romania won the final game at love, ending with an ace.
In the women's final, top seed Sugiyama won seven straight games from
3-3 in the first set, taking a 4-0 lead in the second and then holding
serve twice more for her third WTA tour title.
