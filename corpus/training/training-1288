OPEC output tops 26.5 million barrels a day in January
Crude oil production by OPEC members rose by 390,000 barrels per day to
26.55 million bpd in January, largely due to a rise in Iraqi output, the
Nicosia-based Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) reported Monday.
The January increase over OPEC's December production of 26.16 million
bpd was largely due to higher Iraqi crude exports under the
"oil-for-food" deal which took effect on December 10, the specialist
review said.
Under the agreement with the United Nations, Iraq is allowed to export
two billion dollars worth of oil every six months to purchase food and
medicine for its population, suffering from the effects of six years of
economic sanctions.
MEES estimated that Iraqi exports totaled 520,000 bpd in January in
addition to 580,000 bpd for domestic consumption and exports to Jordan,
allowed under a special UN exemption.
The 1.1 million bpd total was a rise of 300,000 bpd over the December
average of 800,000 bpd, it said.
MEES said that total production by the 11 members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in January was 1.517 million bpd over
the OPEC output ceiling of 25.033 million bpd set in June.
The review reported last week that the average spot price of OPEC's
basket of seven crudes fell by 28 cents in January to 23.23 dollars per
barrel.
MEES said Iran's crude output increased by 105,000 bpd to 3.705 million
bpd in January while exports rose from 2.4 million bpd in December to
2.505 million bpd in January.
Among other countries exceeding their OPEC quotas in January were
Venezuela, by 841,000 bpd, Nigeria, by 235,000 bpd, Qatar, by 162,000
bpd, Algeria, by 85,000 bpd, Indonesia, by 60,000 bpd, and Kuwait, also
by 60,000 bpd.
According to MEES, OPEC output rose by 3.5 percent last year -- from
24.77 million bpd in 1995 to 25.646 million bpd -- while prices rose by
an average of 3.43 dollars a barrel to 20.29 dollars per barrel, up 20
percent against 1995.
