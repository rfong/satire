UAE to Select Bidder for Satellite Project 
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) will award a major satellite contract in
the third quarter of 1997 and four companies from France and the United
states have been listed to compete for the offer, UAE's official
newspaper "Emirates News" said today.
Etisalat, the state-run communication company in the UAE, has just
opened bids from the four firms battling to snatch the communication
project and it will award the contract and sign an agreement with one
of the four firms in the third quarter of this year, the newspaper
said.
The satellite, named "Thuraga", will be owned and operated by the
Thuraga company which was created last month by Etisalat and other Arab
communication companies.
The satellite is estimated to cost between 700 million and one billion
dollars.
The four firms include Aerospatiale and Alcatel Telecom of France, and
Hughes and Lock heed of the United states, said the newspaper.
Etisalat is the biggest share holder of the Thuraga company with a 26
percent of the joint-venture. It has boosted its capital to around 600
million dollars from 500 million dollars and earmarked 225 million
dollars for the satellite project.
