SLA Releases 27 Lebanese, Palestinian Prisoners 
The Israel-controlled South Lebanon Army (SLA) today released 27
security prisoners including 25 Lebanese and two Palestinians from a
detention center in the "security zone."
Israel Radio said that the release was made for humanitarian reasons.
Twenty-four of the prisoners released today returned to their villages
in the "security zone," while an additional 13 prisoners are slated to
be freed Wednesday.
So far, 250 inmates are still being held by the SLA.
Also today, the SLA members found bodies of three Hezbollah (Party of
God) activists, who were believed to have been killed by the SLA Monday
night when they tried to infiltrate into the "security zone."
The Voice of the South radio station said that they were killed by SLA
tank fire.
Meanwhile, Lebanese reports said that Israeli warplanes today flew over
Hezbollah strongholds north of the "security zone," causing sonic boom
and shattering windows of houses. Syrian anti-aircraft gunners
stationed in Lebanon reportedly fired at Israeli planes.
Radio Free Lebanon said that Israel today renewed artillery attacks on
Hezbollah targets in the Tuffah area in the "security zone."
Radio reports from Lebanon also said that Israeli navy ships today
fired warning shots at Lebanese fishermen trying to defy the
three-week-long sea blockade in south Lebanon.
The Israeli blockade has reportedly been extended to all the Lebanese
ports south of Beirut.
