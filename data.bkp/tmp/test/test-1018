Controversial/JJ verdict/NN overshadows/NNS superlative/VBP Lara/NNP A/DT controversial/JJ vedict/NN by/IN umpire/JJ Mervyn/NNP Kitchen/NN threatened/VBD to/TO overshadow/VB a/DT superlative/JJ innings/NNS from/IN Brian/NNP Lara/NNP as/IN West/NNP Indies/NNP took/VBD command/NN against/IN India/NNP on/IN the/DT fourth/JJ day/NN of/IN the/DT first/JJ cricket/NN Test/NN at/IN Sabina/NNP Park/NNP here/RB Sunday/NNP ./.

Kitchen/NN ,/, an/DT English/JJ umpire/NN standing/NN alongside/IN Steve/NNP Bucknor/NNP ,/, failed/VBD to/TO call/VB upon/IN third/JJ umpire/NN Johnny/NNP Gayle/NNP for/IN a/DT decision/NN on/IN an/DT Indian/JJ appeal/NN for/IN run/NN out/RB against/IN Carl/NNP Hooper/NNP when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD two/CD ./.

A/DT delivery/NN from/IN leg-spin/JJ bowler/NN Anil/NNP Kumble/NNP was/VBD steered/VBN to/TO short/JJ third/JJ man/NN by/IN Roland/NNP Holder/NNP and/CC Hooper/NNP tried/VBD to/TO steal/VB a/DT run/NN ./.

Television/NNP replays/NNS appeared/VBD to/TO show/VB that/IN Navjot/NNP Sidhu/NNP 's/POS direct/JJ hit/NN at/IN the/DT bowler/NN 's/POS end/NN had/VBD struck/VBN the/DT stumps/NNS with/IN the/DT toe/NN of/IN Hooper/NNP 's/POS bat/NN three/CD to/TO six/CD inches/NNS short/RB of/IN the/DT mark/NN ./.

Umpire/JJ Kitchen/NN 's/POS not/RB out/JJ decision/NN was/VBD given/VBN based/VBN upon/IN the/DT evidence/NN of/IN his/PRP$ naked/JJ eye/NN --/: but/CC clearly/RB he/PRP should/MD have/VB consulted/VBN umpire/JJ Gayle/NN ./.

West/NNP Indies/NNP were/VBD 207/VBN for/IN four/CD at/IN the/DT time/NN and/CC Hooper/NNP 's/POS dismissal/NN could/MD have/VB brought/VBN another/DT twist/NN to/TO what/WP has/VBZ been/VBN an/DT entertaining/JJ match/NN ./.

Having/VBG gained/VBN a/DT first/JJ innings/NNS lead/NN of/IN 81/CD by/IN dismissing/VBG India/NNP for/IN 346/CD ,/, West/NNP Indies/NNP ,/, helped/VBN on/IN their/PRP$ way/NN by/IN a/DT superb/JJ 78/CD from/IN Lara/NNP ,/, were/VBD 241/CD for/IN four/CD at/IN the/DT close/NN ./.

Hooper/NNP ,/, unbeaten/NN on/IN 12/CD ,/, and/CC Roland/NNP Holder/NNP ,/, 21/CD not/RB out/IN ,/, had/VBD refused/VBN the/DT umpires/JJ offer/NN for/IN bad/JJ light/NN at/IN 5:45/CD p.m./RB -LRB-/-LRB- local/JJ time/NN -RRB-/-RRB- when/WRB West/NNP Indies/NNP were/VBD 207/CD for/IN four/CD ,/, but/CC Bucknor/NNP and/CC Kitchen/NNP had/VBD their/PRP$ way/NN half-hour/NN later/RB when/WRB they/PRP decided/VBD to/TO be/VB `/`` safe/JJ rather/RB than/IN sorry/JJ ./.

Lara/NNP 's/POS marvellous/NNS strokeplay/RB had/VBD illuminated/VBN the/DT ground/NN and/CC brought/VBN a/DT crowd/NN of/IN over/IN 10,000/CD to/TO its/PRP$ feet/NNS ./.

His/PRP$ exciting/JJ innings/NNS lasted/VBD an/DT hour-and-a-half/NN in/IN which/WDT time/NN he/PRP smote/VBP eight/CD fours/NNS and/CC one/CD six/CD off/IN 83/CD balls/NNS ./.

Before/IN his/PRP$ dismissal/NN ,/, offering/VBG a/DT thin/JJ edge/NN when/WRB he/PRP cut/VBD at/IN a/DT delivery/NN from/IN leg-spin/JJ bowler/NN Anil/NNP Kumble/NNP ,/, the/DT gifted/JJ left-hander/NN completely/RB transformed/VBD the/DT innings/NNS in/IN adding/VBG a/DT rapid/JJ 135/CD in/IN almost/RB equal/JJ time/NN with/IN Shivnarine/NNP Chanderpaul/NNP ,/, whose/WP$ 48/CD contained/VBD five/CD fours/NNS in/IN just/RB over/IN two/CD hours/NNS ./.

As/IN West/NNP Indies/NNP tried/VBD for/IN quick/JJ runs/NNS to/TO prompt/VB a/DT declaration/NN either/CC before/IN the/DT close/NN or/CC early/RB on/IN Monday/NNP 's/POS final/JJ day/NN ,/, Chanderpaul/NNP and/CC Sherwin/NNP Campbell/NNP ,/, who/WP had/VBD shared/VBN 68/CD for/IN the/DT first/JJ wicket/NN with/IN Stuart/NNP Williams/NNP ,/, had/VBD been/VBN tied/VBN down/RP by/IN Kumble/NNP and/CC medium-paced/JJ bowler/NN Venkatesh/NNP Prasad/NNP after/IN the/DT tea/NN break/NN was/VBD adjusted/VBN because/RB of/IN two/CD interruptions/NNS for/IN rain/NN that/WDT lasted/VBD an/DT hour/NN in/IN total/NN ./.

Typically/RB Lara/NNP swung/VBD the/DT match/NN firmly/RB to/TO the/DT West/NNP Indies/NNP with/IN a/DT volley/NN of/IN strokes/NNS that/WDT shattered/VBD the/DT confidence/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT bowlers/NNS including/VBG Kumble/NNP who/WP watched/VBD helplessly/RB as/IN one/CD of/IN his/PRP$ deliveries/NNS went/VBD for/IN a/DT massive/JJ straight/RB six/CD ./.

Earlier/RB ,/, India/NNP gained/VBD precious/JJ few/JJ runs/NNS in/IN just/RB over/IN an/DT hour/NN when/WRB they/PRP moved/VBD from/IN their/PRP$ overnight/JJ total/NN of/IN 308/CD for/IN seven/CD to/TO frustrate/VB West/NNP Indies/NNP ,/, who/WP gained/VBD the/DT early/JJ breakthrough/NN when/WRB Nayan/NNP Mongia/NNP miscued/VBD a/DT hook/NN at/IN a/DT short-ball/NN from/IN fast/JJ bowler/NN Courtney/NNP Walsh/NNP to/TO square/JJ leg/NN ./.

The/DT fast/JJ bowler/NN ended/VBD with/IN six/CD for/IN 100/CD off/IN 33/CD overs/NNS ./.
