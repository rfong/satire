Rabin, Clinton seek aid to shore up Arafat by Charly Wegman 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and US President Bill Clinton are to seek
ways to shore up Yasser Arafat's shaken self-rule authority at their
talks in Washington later Monday, Israeli officials said.
A senior foreign ministry official said they would "do their utmost to
come to the help of the self-rule authority," which has been heavily
criticized since clashes in Gaza City on Friday in which 15 people were
killed.
Rabin, anxious to ensure Arafat fends off an Islamic fundamentalist
challenge and stays in control of Gaza and Jericho, is to call for
emergency international aid for the Palestinians, the official said,
asking not to be named.
Only 100 million dollars out of 700 million pledged by donors for 1994
has so far been released to the Palestinians. Donor countries are set
to meet in Paris next week.
The US State Department, echoing calls from Egypt, has said the Gaza
clashes between Islamic fundamentalists and Arafat's police were a
"warning signal" that funds must quickly be channeled to the
Palestinian autonomous areas.
"More must be done to bring to the Palestinian people concrete benefits
of peace," said State Department spokesman David Johnson.
Rabin, who is to meet Arafat on Thursday in Madrid on his way back from
the United States, was also expected to work to maintain the current US
annual aid to Israel of three billion dollars.
It was to be his first talks with Clinton since the Republican takeover
of Congress in November 8 elections and their pledges to cut foreign
aid. Rabin was also to meet with Republican leaders.
The Israeli leader warned his cabinet on November 13 that because of
the Republican election sweep, the United States would "become more
conservative, more isolationist and less inclined to pay out foreign
aid."
Clinton himself had vowed to the Israeli parliament on October 27 that
he would work to keep US aid at current levels. But after the
Republican legislative landslide, his hands may be increasingly tied.
However Rabin has said he had Washington's assurances that US aid would
be maintained in fiscal 1995, through the end of September.
The Israel-Syria track of the Middle East peace process was also on the
Clinton-Rabin agenda, as the Jewish state and Damascus accuse each
other of dragging their feet in the negotiations through US mediation.
Israel is also worried over Republican opposition to a US contingent
for a multinational force of observers on the Golan.
"We only want to assure our defence. There is no question of
positioning a fighting multinational force on the Golan," which Israel
seized from Syria in 1967, said the Israeli ambassador to Washington,
Itamar Rabinovich.
But Republican Senator Jesse Helms, in line to become head of the
powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January, opposes greater
US military aid if Israel withdraws from the Golan as part of a peace
deal with Syria.
Another item on Rabin's agenda was to ask the United States to sign a
memorandum to continue financing the anti-missile Arrow missile being
developed by Israel Aircraft Industries.
Washington currently picks up about 75 percent of the bill for the
Arrow, which originally was part of the now-defunct US "Star Wars"
programme.
Rabin also wants to clinch US support for Israel to join NATO, thus
ensuring access to radar and air-to-air missile technology, said Yediot
Aharonot newspaper said.
