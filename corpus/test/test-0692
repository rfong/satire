Love, set and match: Andre Agassi, Brooke Shields tie the knot 
Tennis star Andre Agassi has tied the knot with actress Brooke Shields
in a small church tucked away on the scenic northern California
coastline.
The rain that visited Monterey Friday was gone and it was sunny and
warm as the wedding entourage arrived at St. John's Episcopal Church
next to the Del Monte Golf Course shortly before 5:00 p.m. Saturday
(0001 GMT Sunday).
"We didn't even know what was going on until all these cars and
helicopters showed up," said Chuck Dunbar, who works in the Golf Course
pro shop.
"It wasn't until I turned on the TV later that I found out who was
getting married."
Media choppers vying for glimpses of the marriage of Agassi, the former
world number one and reigning Olympic champion, and Shields, a child
model and actress now starring in NBC television's comedy "Suddenly
Susan," whipped up so much dust that course operators reduced greens
fees for some golfers.
Monterey police officers and private security guards ringed the small
chapel. Agassi, 26, has gone to great pains to keep details of his
relationship with the 31-year-old Shields private, repeatedly declining
to discuss their wedding plans.
During America's Davis Cup tie with the Netherlands in Neport Beach,
California, two weeks ago, Agassi declined to confirm a report that he
and Shields had an engagement party in Malibu, California, in March.
"Don't believe everything you read," Agassi said.
Dunbar said St. John's was perfect for a couple trying to avoid
publicity.
"It's a very small church hidden back there in the trees," Dunbar said.
"Unless you knew where you were going you wouldn't notice it. Maybe
that's why they picked it."
The wedding reception at the Stone Pine resort in upscale Carmel, where
Clint Eastwood was once mayor, went on late into the night, according
to a receptionist at the resort.
Television images from the ceremony showed Shields in a white wedding
gown, said to have a train of 1.5 meters (five feet).
