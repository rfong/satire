Kuwait Approves Plan to Build New City 
The Kuwaiti Cabinet approved Sunday a plan to build a new city in
Al-Sabbiah in a bid to increase population areas in the country's
northern part.
The Al-Sabbiah is expected to accommodate in the coming 30 years some
250,000 people, about 9 percent of the country's total population,
Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Nasser Al-Roudhan said after the
weekly cabinet session.
The minister said the cabinet also approved to build a bridge linking
Al-Sabbiah City and Kuwait City to shorten the distance between them. A
highway will also be built to link Kuwait City and the northern areas.
The new city will include service facilities, a complex for government
authorities, an industrial area, an entertainment park, university and
technical education institutions, ports and power stations, Al-Roudhan
said.
He said the cabinet agreed in principle to assign an independent
authority to supervise the companies constructing the city.
The cabinet hoped that this project would "be a serious contribution in
the country's comprehensive development scheme and meet growing demands
for housing units, as well as enhancing national economy," the minister
said.
