Chinese State Councilor Meets Japanese Businessmen 
Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi met here today with Shoichiro Toyoda,
president of the Japanese- Chinese Investment Promotion Council
(JCIPC).
Wu called the recent 10th JCIPC Session a success, which played a
positive role in advancing bilateral economic and trade relations.
She said that the Chinese economy has been developing smoothly, and
China is implementing the development program for its western regions,
and the process of its entry into the World Trade Organization has been
accelerating, adding all these have provided enormous business
opportunities for foreign entrepreneurs.
Toyoda, who is here for the Fourth China Investment and Trade Fair in
the Xiamen Special Economic Zone in east China's coastal province of
Fujian, said that more than 50 Japanese entrepreneurs are accompanying
him on the business tour, and they are eager to pursue even more
cooperation with their Chinese counterparts in the trade fair.
