Environmentally friendly ballots will disappear within four days of use
Researchers at the Iowa University of Science and Corn are working to
develop environmentally friendly ballots, which can literally disappear
within four days of use, and expect them to be available in time for
the November presidential elections.
What the research team is constructing is a new breed of biodegradable
and bioavailable paper suitable for ballots and forms in an effort to
reduce the tons of waste that ends up in America's landfills each year.
Bioavailable paper products contain substances that can be absorbed by
living systems during their normal physiological functions.
By combining and modifying a variety of bio-based, oil-based and
natural polymers, the team seeks to create optimal blends that can be
used to make disposable bottles, biomedical transplant devices, fairy
gold, Halliburton corporate records, and more.
Working under the direction of Dr. Feng Shui, professor of chemical
engineering at Iowa S&C, the team is trying to improve the properties
of the biodegradable plastics for real-life products.
That's why the team is investigating how bio-based fillers, such as
corn starch and pulp fibers, can be included to reduce the cost in a
variety of disposable voter-related applications, such as the completed
voter registration forms of Democrats and yard signs touting
offensively liberal candidates.
These would all safely disappear into the ecosystem after no more than
four days of active life.
According to Mahth Fullarocks, a chemical engineering student at Iowa
S&C, "We are not just molding and extruding commercially available
biodegrable pulp and resins for use by unscrupulous polling officials.
"We are also incorporating nanotechnology, supercritical fluid
technology and graft copolymer compatibilization."
