Chinese Police Subject of Opinion Poll 
A public opinion poll in east China's Jiangxi Province shows that about
90 percent of the local residents are satisfied with the work of local
police.
The two-month survey was conducted by all police stations in the
province.
About one million local people from all walks of life took part in the
survey which reviewed the work of more than 10,000 policemen.
The respondents gave suggestions to those public security officers
whose job performance has not been satisfactory.
Peng Huangong, deputy director of the Jiangxi Provincial Public
Security Department, said that opening the public security sector to
public scrutiny is a big step by the province to improve supervision
over local police.
According to Peng, police stations elsewhere in the country now intend
to conduct similar polls.
