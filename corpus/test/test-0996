China Protecting Rights and Interests of Overseas Chinese 
China has been protecting the rights and interests of returned overseas
Chinese and their relatives, who in turn have contributed much to its
economic and social development.
Lin Liyun, a member of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC) and deputy-director of the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Committee of the NPC, made the remark at the Committee's 16th
meeting here today.
In 1990, the Law to Protect the Rights and Interests of Returned
Overseas Chinese and Relatives was adopted at the 15th meeting of the
Standing Committee of the Seventh NPC.
"In this way, the rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese and
their relatives can be protected under the law," Lin said.
She noted that overseas Chinese have played an active part in the
development of the motherland, their hometowns in particular, and in
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
However, Lin pointed out that there is still a long way to go in
improving China's legal system concerning overseas Chinese.
Along with China's reforms, opening-up, and economic growth,
business-related problems of overseas Chinese and their relatives have
begun to emerge, and it is necessary to solve such problems by legal
means, she said.
Lin suggested that the NPC Standing Committee strengthen national and
local legislation on overseas Chinese affairs, and at the same time
reinforce supervision on the implementation of the related laws.
