ADB Approves Grant to Greater Mekong Subregion 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) today approved a technical assistance
grant of 2.5 million U.S. dollars for a hydropower development study in
the greater Mekong subregion.
According to the bank, the grant will be used to prepare a sustainable
and environmentally acceptable hydropower development plan for some
river basins in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
The study is designed to facilitate economic cooperation among the
countries of the subregion through cross-border trade in electricity. A
low-cost hydropower development program will be set up if maximum
benefits can be realized from the cross-border power exchange.
The greater Mekong subregion comprises Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam,
Myanmar, Thailand and Yunnan province of China.
The ADB also approved a grant for strengthening banking capabilities in
eight transitional economies in Asia and some loans to Kazakhstan for
road rehabilitation.
An 885,000 U.S. dollar grant will be provided for a two-week program of
lectures, case studies and site visits for participants from Cambodia,
China, and six other Asian countries.
Kazakhstan will use the 50 million U.S. dollar loan, the ADB's first
loan to its transport sector, to rehabilitate its national road network
connecting key centers of the country.
