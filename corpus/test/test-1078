Kenya Captures Men's, Women's Titles
It was a day for Kenya at Sunday's 19th annual Lilac Bloomsday race as
Josphat Machuka won the men's race for the second year in a row and
Bloomsday rookie Delillah Asiago won the women's competition by a
2-minute margin.
The Kenyans set records for the 12-kilometer (7.46-mile) course through
city streets, with Machuka's 33:41 erasing the 33:55 mark held jointly
by Kenya's Yobes Ondieki (1992) and Mexico's Arturo Barrios (1993).
Asiago's 38:19 was 26 seconds faster than the women's mark set last
year by American Olga Appell, who did not compete this year.
The race drew an estimated 59,000 who ran, jogged, walked or rolled the
course. This city of 177,000 virtually shuts down on race morning.
Mexican Armando Quintinilla was second in the men's event for the
second straight year, finishing in 34:09.
Quintinilla traded the lead with the 19-year-old Machuka midway through
the race but could not keep pace in the final kilometers. Machuka
improved on his 1994 time by 18 seconds.
Kenyans captured five of the top eight places, with Ibrahim Kinuitha
taking third at 34:33 and Simon Karori coming in fourth at 34:44.
Ecuador's Silvio Guerra was fifth (35:09) while 1992 Bloomsday winner
Ondieki was sixth (35:21).
In the women's race, Asiago ran away from the field in the third
kilometers and never looked back, finishing 2:06 ahead of Nadia Prasad.
The French citizen, who lives in the United States, also came in second
last year, when she finished more than a minute faster at 39:05.
Russian marathoner Olga Markova took third (40:30), and was followed by
Americans Jody Hawkins (41:21) and Kim Jones (41:39) and Kenya's Jane
Omoro (41:40).
The men's and women's winners each received dlrs 7,000 in prize money.
