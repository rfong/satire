Iran Urges Developing Nations to Cope With Globalization Unitedly 
Globalization is the major challenge facing developing countries which
should set up a forum to encourage interaction among themselves,
Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal Kharrazi said here on Friday.
Kharrazi made the remarks while addressing audience at the University
of Zimbabwe on globalization, civilizations and cultural rights.
"It is through dialogue that we get to prepare to interact as
countries. We should get together and develop a united front," said the
minister.
Globalization, he said, had an impact on a country's economy as the
more resources and technology a country had the better it was ranked in
terms of being advanced, and by being in this position it was
considered more powerful.
He said although it was usually difficult for different countries to
speak with one voice all the time, a program to encourage such a forum
was necessary.
Kharrazi was in Zimbabwe for a three-day official visit aimed at
finding possible areas of cooperation between the two countries both in
the public and private sectors.
