Somali Faction Leader Pulls Forces Out Of Lower Shabelle Region 
Somali faction leaders Osman Hassan Ali Atto withdrew all his forces
from Dhanane and Jilib-Merca in the Lower kshabelle Region to the
capital this morning, without any clashes with the soldiers of his
rival Gen. Mohamed farah Aidid.
Armed with more than 28 technical war wagons, Atto's militiamen have
now occupied the strategic positions in and near South Mogadish, such
as the former US Embassy compound, the University compound, the Sward
base and the K-7 junction.
At K-7 Junction, Atto's men have erected a check point without
disturbing the civilian traffic.
It is widely believed that General Aidid's men would not hesitate to
attack the check point since K-7 junction is the only entrance to
Mogadishu from southern Somalia. General Aidid forces are currently
stationed in Baidoa, Huddur, Merca and its surroundings.
The reason for the withdrawal is not yet known, but supporters of Osman
Atto have said the move is a military tactic.
At the same time, a large number of the militiamen of General Aidid
have also moved into the capital of Mogadishu from Lower Shabelle. The
reason is also unknown, but supporters of Aidid said his control of
South Mogadishu is now a problem to be dealt with.
Even though no militia movement have been made yet by any of the rival
militiamen, there is still a growing fear that there will soon be
bloody clashes between the followers of Atto and Aidid in Mogadishu.
This is the second time the militiamen of Atto withdrew safely from
their bases in Lower Shabelle Region since the armed clashes between
his militiamen and those of General Aidid began there last week.
