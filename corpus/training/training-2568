Chief Rabbi of World Sephardi Federation dies at 82 
Rabbi Solomon Gaon, head of the World Sephardi Federation, died
Wednesday of pneumonia at Mt. Sinai Medical Center here, a spokesman
said late Thursday.
Gaon, considered the international spokesman for Sephardic Jews -
descendants of Jews expelled from Spain in 1492, had turned 82 a week
before his death.
His remains will be buried in Israel.
Born in Yugoslavia, Gaon studied at the Yeshiva of Sarjevo and was
ordained rabbi in 1948 at Jews' College in London.
In 1968 he was elected president of the American Society of Sephardi
Studies and ten years later he became chief rabbi of the congregations
affiliated with the World Sephardi Federation.
He is survived by his wife Regina, a daughter and a son and four
grandchildren.
