Inter-clan warfare in capital kills 27 
Inter-clan warfare raging in Medina, a southern Mogadishu district,
since Tuesday has left at least 27 people dead and more than 100
wounded, correspondents on the scene said Friday.
Meanwhile five Indian UN soldiers were hurt, including two seriously,
overnight in the explosion of a mortar shell inside their camp at
Mogadishu airport, which borders the Medina district, the Indian
commander of the UN operation in Somalia said.
The correspondents visited Medina Friday during a lull in violent
battles in the pocket, which is outside the control of warlord Mohamed
Farah Aidid whose supporters control the rest of the south of the
lawless capital.
UN spokesmen said earlier UN troops had not been involved in the
fighting.
Witnesses said the fighting pitted the Abgal and the Murusade, two
rival factions of the Hawiye clan. It was reportedly sparked by the
defection of one faction leader from the camp of self-styled "interim
president" Ali Mahdi, who rules northern Mogadishu, to General Aidid.
The flare-up of fighting in Somalia comes as the 15,000 UN troops here
withdraw prior to a March 31 deadline following the failure of Aidid
and Ali Mahdi to agree on a government of national unity.
