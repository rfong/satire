U.S. Announces Easing of Sanctions Against Cuba 
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on Friday that the U.S. will
permit a resumption of direct humanitarian charter flights to Cuba as
part of measures easing sanctions against Cuba.
The actions that the U.S. administration will take also include
bipartisan legislation to meet humanitarian food needs in Cuba,
streamline the issuance of licenses for the sale of medical supplies
and permit Cuban Americans to send remittances to their relatives in
Cuba.
"They do not reflect a change in policy towards the Cuban government,"
said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at a press conference.
She added that economic pressure through the embargo and the
Helms-Burton Act will be maintained.
The U.S.'s embargo against Cuba has lasted nearly four decades. In
1996, the Helms-Burton Act was enacted to punish any foreign firms
doing business with Cuba.
