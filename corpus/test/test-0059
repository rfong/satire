UK Backs Russian Reform Despite Chechnya
British Prime Minister John Major said today that Britain will continue
to support President Boris Yeltsin's reform efforts despite Russia's
military compaign in Chechnya.
In a wide-ranging speech at a conference called "Britain in the World",
Major said that support for Russian reforms illustrated Britain's
long-term approach to foreign policy.
"It may take a generation before Russia has full range of effective
democratic institutions, more before its people enjoy the standard of
living we take for granted in the West. But we shall take the long
view," he said.
He condemned Russia's military campaign in Chenchnya, saying it was
"wrong and brutal".
"We should not pull our punches over Chechnya," he said, adding that
fighting in Chechnya must stop and international norms of behavior be
respected.
However, he said, "The huge error does not toll the knell of economic
and political reform." "It remains in our interest to encourage reform
in Russia, and to develop cooperation in foreign policy," he stressed.
He told the audience that as a gesture of support, he stood by his
agreement with Boris Yeltsin last year to attend the "Victory in Europe
Day" ceremonies in Moscow.
In his speech, Major called on warring parties in Bosnia to find a
negotiated outcome. "There will be no clear-cut military solution," he
said.
On the Middle East, Major said that this is an area fraught with
political risk, but Britain has large interest in it.
Referring to his visit to the region two weeks ago, he said, "I was the
first G7 leader to visit Chairman Arafat in Gaza. I went because we
have an interest in supporting the peace process."
Major called on Turkey to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq, where
it is pursuing Kurdish rebels, as soon as possible and to avoid harm to
civilians.
He also urged Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to take up a proposal
Britain is launching in the UN Security Council, that Iraq be allowed
to sell oil to buy food and medicines.
"We want to see an end to malnutrition and deaths from curable
diseases. Saddam must show whether he has concern for his people," he
said.
