Arafat heads to Egypt for Mubarak, Christopher talks 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat left Monday for Cairo for talks
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, officials said.
Before leaving Gaza City by helicopter, Arafat dismissed Israeli
reports that an accord on an Israeli pullout from the West Bank town of
Hebron would be signed during the Tuesday-Thursday regional economic
conference in Cairo.
"Nothing has been achieved," Arafat told journalists when asked about
the reports. Negotiatiors have been wrangling for the past month over
an accord for the long-delayed Israeli withdrawal in Hebron.
His adviser Nabil Abu Rudeina said Arafat would meet Mubarak upon
arrival in Cairo, then meet Christopher in the evening to discuss "the
latest developments in the peace process and the obstacles in it,
especially the Hebron pullout."
The Palestinian leader is not due to participate in the Middle East
economic conference. Christopher, who will attend, was expected in
Cairo later Monday.
