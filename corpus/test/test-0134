Australian budget pushes shares up 2.7 percent over the week 
Australian share prices surged 2.7 percent over the week to Friday as
the market gave its seal of approval to a tough federal budget handed
down Tuesday.
The Australian Stock Exchange's barometer, the all ordinaries index,
ended the week at 2,292.9 points, 59.6 points up on the previous week's
finish.
"The bulk of the gains were due to the budget," said Lance Jones broker
Philip Toop.
"Economists were generally happy with it and the upgrade from Standard
and Poor's also gave us another boost."
International ratings agency Standard and Poor's Wednesday said it had
revised Australia's foreign currency rating outlook to positive from
stable because of the tough budget stance taken by the government.
Toop said some healthy profit results also helped to dispel the gloom
which had settled over the market in recent weeks as pre-budget jitters
kept investors away.
Share prices rallied 1.3 percent Monday after weeks of lacklustre
trade, as pre-budget uncertainty budget began to evaporate.
Investors swarmed back into the market Wednesday, contributing to a 0.9
percent gain, encouraged by the a raft of funding cuts which halved the
budget deficit.
Some profit taking set in Thursday but a strong performance from bank
stocks helped lift the all ordinaries by a hefty 0.8 percent Friday,
indicating there was still some steam left in the budget-led rally.
The all industrials index ended 2.6 percent higher at 3,462.2 over the
week, while the all resources index rose 2.8 percent to 1,407.0.
Average daily turnover totalled 318.2 million shares worth 789.8
million Australian dollars (624 million US) compared to the previous
week's 218.7 million shares worth 481.1 million dollars.
Resource giant BHP gained 47 cents over the week to end at 17.64
dollars while global miner RTZ-CRA surged 75 cents to 19.70 dollars and
media giant News Corp. firmed 22 cents to 6.70 dollars.
