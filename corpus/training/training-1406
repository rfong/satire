UK Official Says No New NATO Entries Considered for Now
The United Kingdom Defense Secretary George Robertson said Monday that no
more countries would be received into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) next April.
"We will not be issuing new invitations at the Washington Summit," the
Reuters News Agency quoted Robertson as saying while commenting on the
possibility of the upcoming expansion step of the world's largest
military alliance.
The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, which had been foes of the West
during Cold War, are to be made full members of NATO at a Washington
summit next April which will mark the 50th anniversary of the alliance.
Robertson, who is on his way to visit Czech, said the time had come to
reflect on any further NATO expansion at the moment.
But he said stopping issuing new invitations "doesn't mean to say the
door is closed,"
"The road beyond that is going to have clear milestones to encourage
other countries to become part of the European defense family," he
said.
Slovenia and Romania are seen as being among the leading hopefuls in
the next wave of NATO enlargement in Eastern Europe, followed by
Bulgaria, Slovakia and the Baltic states.
In the interview by the Reuters, Robertson made it clear that
membership of NATO was "not some sort of honor that is bestowed upon
new democracies".
"It is a functioning military alliance and it requires
interoperability," he said.
