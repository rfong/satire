Dollar/NNP Down/NNP Slightly/NNP ,/, Stocks/NNS Higher/JJR in/IN Early/NNP Trading/NNP The/NNP U.S./NNP dollar/NN was/VBD slightly/RB lower/JJR but/CC steady/JJ against/IN the/DT Japanese/JJ yen/NN early/JJ Monday/NNP in/IN Tokyo/NNP in/IN a/DT muted/JJ reaction/NN to/TO the/DT breakdown/NN of/IN U.S.-Japan/JJ auto/NN talks/NNS over/IN the/DT weekend/NN ./.

Traders/NNS said/VBD the/DT mood/NN on/IN the/DT market/NN was/VBD quiet/JJ and/CC tense/JJ in/IN anticipation/NN of/IN a/DT U.S./NNP announcement/NN early/RB this/DT week/NN of/IN tough/JJ trade/NN sanctions/NNS against/IN Japan/NNP ,/, a/DT step/NN that/WDT would/MD aggravate/VB tensions/NNS between/IN the/DT two/CD giant/JJ economies/NNS and/CC possibly/RB shatter/VB the/DT dollar/NN 's/POS recent/JJ stability/NN ./.

Japan/NNP has/VBZ said/VBD it/PRP would/MD file/VB a/DT complaint/NN with/IN the/DT World/NNP Trade/NNP Organization/NNP ,/, the/DT recenlty/RB formed/VBN trade/NN arbiter/NN ,/, if/IN Washington/NNP publishes/VBZ a/DT sanctions/NNS list/NN ./.

President/NNP Clinton/NNP had/VBD promised/VBN strong/JJ measures/NNS if/IN the/DT talks/NNS broke/VBD down/RP ./.

Economists/NNS and/CC traders/NNS fear/VBP that/IN an/DT escalation/NN of/IN trade/NN frictions/NNS could/MD renew/VB the/DT dollar/NN 's/POS plunge/NN to/TO record/VB lows/NNS against/IN the/DT dollar/NN ,/, but/CC for/IN now/RB traders/NNS are/VBP waiting/VBG to/TO see/VB what/WP happens/VBZ next/JJ ./.

``/`` The/DT market/NN is/VBZ waiting/VBG for/IN the/DT details/NNS of/IN the/DT sanctions/NNS ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Chemical/NNP Bank/NNP trader/NN Junichi/NNP Kodama/NNP ./.

``/`` There/EX is/VBZ sentiment/NN that/IN the/DT dollar/NN has/VBZ already/RB bottomed/VBN out/RP ,/, and/CC some/DT people/NNS are/VBP becoming/VBG bullish/JJ on/IN the/DT dollar/NN .../: even/RB though/IN news/NN is/VBZ not/RB good/JJ ./. ''/''

``/`` Trading/NNP is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO stay/VB in/IN a/DT limited/JJ range/NN until/IN sanctions/NNS are/VBP announced/VBN ./.

After/IN that/DT ,/, the/DT dollar/NN may/MD be/VB back/RB on/IN a/DT downtrend/NN ,/, ''/'' Kodama/NNP said/VBD ./.

The/DT dollar/NN opened/VBD the/DT week/NN 's/POS trading/NN at/IN 83.58/CD yen/NNS on/IN the/DT Tokyo/NNP foreign/JJ exchange/NN market/NN ,/, down/IN 0.18/CD yen/NNS from/IN 83.76/CD yen/NNS at/IN 5/CD p.m./NN -LRB-/-LRB- 0800/CD GMT/NN -RRB-/-RRB- last/JJ Tuesday/NNP ,/, before/IN markets/NNS closed/VBD for/IN a/DT five-day/JJ holiday/NN ./.

The/DT Tokyo/NNP open/NN was/VBD also/RB down/RB from/IN 83.95/CD yen/NNS in/IN late/JJ New/NNP York/NNP trading/NN Friday/NNP ./.

After/IN hitting/VBG a/DT global/JJ record/NN low/NN of/IN 79.75/CD yen/NNS on/IN April/NNP 19/CD in/IN Tokyo/NNP ,/, the/DT dollar/NN has/VBZ steadied/VBN itself/PRP in/IN the/DT low/JJ 80/CD yen/NN range/NN ./.

Many/DT consider/VBP the/DT dollar/NN 's/POS persistent/JJ decline/NN against/IN the/DT yen/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS to/TO be/VB the/DT result/NN of/IN unprecedented/JJ growth/NN in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP trade/NN deficit/NN with/IN Japan/NNP ,/, which/WDT reached/VBD a/DT record/NN dlrs/VBZ 66/CD billion/CD last/JJ year/NN ./.

Autos/NNS and/CC auto/NN parts/NNS account/VBP for/IN about/RB 60/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT deficit/NN ./.

Market/NN players/NNS generally/RB believe/VBP that/IN Washington/NNP wants/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ yen/NN as/IN a/DT way/NN to/TO open/VB Japanese/JJ markets/NNS to/TO foreign/JJ products/NNS ./.

Washington/NNP has/VBZ strengthened/VBN that/DT association/NN by/IN emphasizing/VBG the/DT link/NN between/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT auto/NN trade/NN talks/NNS and/CC the/DT currency/NN issue/NN ./.

Japanese/JJ officials/NNS complain/VBP about/IN what/WP they/PRP view/VBP as/IN Washington/NNP 's/POS lukewarm/JJ stance/NN in/IN arresting/VBG the/DT dollar/NN 's/POS steady/JJ decline/NN ./.

So/IN far/RB this/DT year/NN ,/, the/DT dollar/NN 's/POS value/NN has/VBZ fallen/VBN about/IN 16/CD percent/NN against/IN the/DT yen/NN ./.

In/IN theory/NN ,/, a/DT higher/JJR yen/NNS would/MD trim/VB Japan/NNP 's/POS trade/NN surplus/NN by/IN forcing/VBG Japanese/JJ exporters/NNS to/TO raise/VB prices/NNS ,/, rendering/VBG them/PRP less/RBR competitive/JJ abroad/RB ./.

But/CC Japan/NNP 's/POS trade/NN surplus/NN has/VBZ ballooned/VBN over/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS despite/IN the/DT persistent/JJ appreciation/NN of/IN the/DT yen/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN ,/, share/NN prices/NNS rose/VBD slightly/RB in/IN thin/JJ trading/NN following/VBG an/DT arbitrage-led/JJ rally/NN last/JJ week/NN ./.

Traders/NNS said/VBD the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT dollar/NN did/VBD not/RB plunge/VB in/IN early/JJ dealings/NNS was/VBD a/DT positive/JJ factor/NN for/IN the/DT market/NN ./.

The/DT 225-issue/JJ Nikkei/NNP Stock/NNP Average/NNP rose/VBD 25.14/CD points/NNS ,/, or/CC 0.15/CD percent/NN ,/, to/TO 17,113.80/CD after/IN the/DT first/JJ half-hour/NN of/IN trading/NN ./.
