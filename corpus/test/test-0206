The agreement is to run for four months, subject to renewal, and
represents the transformation of a ceasefire that government and Serb
troops have been generally respecting since December 24.
That agreement followed a mid-December mediation misson by former US
president Jimmy Carter.
Since then, UN officials here have shuttled between the two parties in
a bid to win backing for the more comprehensive pact.
The Bosnian Serbs have rejected an international peace plan unveiled
last July by Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States,
which would reduce their control of Bosnian territory from 70 percent
to 49 percent.
But they have lately signalled a willingness to consider the plan as a
basis of negotiations.
The Bosnian government has accepted the proposal.
