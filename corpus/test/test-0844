The paper also quoted Murdoch as confirming News Corp. was on track for
a 20 percent rise in operating profit in the current year.
"If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does,

Meanwhile, Queensland Press yesterday announced that Murdoch's eldest
son Lachlan, 25, had been appointed chairman.
It follows his appointment as managing director of the media
proprietor's Australian subsidiary, News Ltd., last month.
