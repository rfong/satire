Mazu Cultural Tourism Festival Goes On-Line 
A website at: www.putian.gov.cn/ mazu, has been launched for the
upcoming Mazu Cultural Tourism Festival on April 29-30 on Meizhou
Island in east China's Fujian Province.
Information about festival programs, scenic spots, and investment
guides are offered on-line, making it more convenient for Mazu pilgrims
from around the world to participate.
Mazu, "the Goddess of Peace of the Straits," is believed to have been
born on Meizhou Island, and this attracts a large number of Mazu
pilgrims from across the world every year.
Meizhou has the world's first Mazu temple, the ancestor of the other
3,000 Mazu temples scattered in more than 20 countries and regions of
China.
Today, the number of Mazu followers exceeds 100 million worldwide, and
the number in Taiwan has reached 16 million, accounting for 75 percent
of the total population of the island province.
In recent years, more than 100,000 Taiwan compatriots have come to
Meizhou annually to pay respect to the Goddess of the Sea.
