UN tries to assist fleeing Serbs 
UN aid workers were hoping Friday to send a first convoy of food and
supplies to tens of thousands of Bosnian Serbs who have fled their
homes in the face of an onslaught by Bosnian government troops and
Croat forces, UN sources said.
Between 40,000 and 50,000 refugees are believed to have sought refuge
in the Serb-held town of Banja Luka in northwest Bosnia, according to
unconfirmed figures.
NATO air attacks, now provisionally halted, and fighting in the area
have made it impossible to supply UN depots in Banja Luka, UNHCR
spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said.
The latest wave of refugees arrived in midweek after Bosnian government
and Croat attacks were launched in the centre and west of Bosnia. They
joined an estimated 200,000 refugees who fled from a Croat offensive
last month in the Krajina region of Croatia, which had been under the
control of Serb separatists.
The UNHCR was planning to send a convoy of eight trucks from Belgrade
to Bijeljina on the Bosnian frontier where Bosnian Serbs would take
charge of it and despatch it to Banja Luka, Berthiaume said.
The convoy is carrying food, blankets, mattresses and groundsheets.
