Jordan says will not expel Israeli ambassador 
Despite the growing Middle East crisis, Jordan has no plans to expel
Israel's ambassador because it believes an open dialogue will be of
more help to the Palestinians, a senior government official said
Monday.
"What purpose will it serve to expel the Israeli ambassador or break
ties with that country?" the senior official, who requested his name
not be used, said in a meeting with journalists.
Jordan has threatened measures against Israel because of the
large-scale assault it launched this week which has pinned down
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, but a cutting of ties would not in
the interest of the Palestinian people, said the official.
"We believe that the dialogue between Jordan and Israel is in the
interest of the Palestinians and our diplomacy is at their service,"
said the official, whose country has been bound by a peace treaty with
the Jewish state since 1994.
Cutting ties with Israel would mean that "medical aid sent by Jordan to
the Palestinian Authority will not reach them," he added.
"But if the situation develops in a way that such measures (cutting
ties) are useful for the Palestinians, then we will consider them but
not before," he warned.
Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Moasher on Sunday told AFP that
Jordan would consider unspecified "measures" against Israel unless it
pulled back its troops immediately from Palestinian territory occupied
since Friday in response to a wave of suicide bombings.
Moasher served the warning personally to Israeli Ambassador David
Dadonn, after summoning him to voice Jordan's "strong protest" at the
military action.
The senior government official also said Jordan was making "regular
phone contacts with Israeli officials to ensure the safety of
Palestinian president Yasser Arafat and prevent a deterioration of the
situation."
He also reiterated Jordan's call for the United Nations to deploy an
international force to separate Israelis and Palestinians.
