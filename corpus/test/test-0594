Philippines to Continue Rice Imports 
The Philippines has planned to import some two million tons of rice in
1999 due to the spillover effects of El Nino and La Nina phenomena and
the projected increase in consumption, the Philippine News Agency
reported Sunday.
National Food Authority (NFA) Administrator Eduardo Nonato Joson was
quoted as saying that even without drought and devastating floods, the
rice production shortfall is estimated at 700,000 to one million tons
yearly.
"Importation will be still critical next year because of our low
productive capacity. The worst case scenario would be minimum of one
million metric tons and maximum of two million metric tons of rice
imports again for 1999," Joson said.
NFA Deputy Administrator Gregorio Tan said that if La Nina, sister of
El Nino, hits the country, the volume of imported rice may be less than
one million tons.
La Nina, which is expected to bring more rains to the country, may
allow greater farm land to be planted next year, Tan explained.
The Philippines has already imported more than 1.2 million tons of rice
this year due to the severe dry spell caused by the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
Joson said the country may import a total of 2.1 million tons of rice
in 1998, including the proposed additional 300,000 tons whose
importation depends on the effects of La Nina. The bulk of the rice
imports this year will be sourced from Vietnam and China.
