Beijing to Play Host in China's FA Cup Final 
Lady of Fortune smiled on China's league runners-up Beijing Guoan when
they were decided by lot-drawing to host title-holders Jinan Taishan in
China's Football Association Cup final here on Thursday.
The FA Cup final, to be staged on November 3rd, will be decided by only
one match, instead of on the home-and-away basis.
Beijing eliminated Dalian Wanda while Jinan saw off Guangdong Hongyuan,
to advance to the final.
