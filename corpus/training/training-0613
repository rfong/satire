Cypriot President Satisfied With China Tour 
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides on Sunday expressed satisfaction
with the outcome of his six-day state visit to China.
Speaking upon arrival at the Cyprus Larnaca Airport, Clerides described
his visit to China as "important."
He said that "practical steps" were taken to boost economic and trade
ties between the two countries.
Clerides visited China on June 6-11, during which he met with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress Li Peng and Premier Zhu Rongji.
Clerides said "we talked freely on various issues, including the Cyprus
question."
The Chinese leaders, he said, expressed "support for an independent,
sovereign Cypriot state and back the integrity and unity of Cyprus'
territory as well as a solution that would result from the
implementation of U.N. resolutions."
There was "identity of views on the need for a peaceful solution of
problems through the U.N., the respect of borders of countries and of
human rights," said the Cypriot president.
