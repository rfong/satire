China's submarine purchases threaten regional security: Taiwan 
Taiwanese Defense Minister Tang Yao-ming said Friday China's reported
plan to buy eight submarines from Russia would threaten security in the
Asia-Pacific region.
"Communist China is seeking to expand its naval power from near sea to
far sea which would threaten regional security," Tang told reporters.
Media reports have said Beijing is negotiating with Russian
manufacturers to buy eight Project 636 Kilo class diesel-electric
submarines for an estimated 1.6 billion US dollars.
The submarines would be delivered in five years with all of them fitted
with Klub-S long-range, anti-ship missile systems.
Tang said the submarines would reinforce China's ability to block the
Taiwan Strait if it invaded the island.
China currently operates four Kilo class submarines.
To help counter China's naval buildup, US President George W. Bush last
year approved the sale of eight diesel-electric submarines to Taiwan as
part of Washington's most comprehensive arms package to Taipei o.ne
1992.
Taiwan now operates two Dutch-built Sword Dragon submarines and two
aging US ones.
The US has remained Taiwan's leading arms supplier despite shifting its
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
Tang said various reforms had been made to strengthen Taiwan's defense
capability as China continued expanding its defense` gxstems.
Taiwan and China, which split in 1949 at the end of a civil war, are
still technically at war despite civil contacts starting in the late
1980s.
Beijing regards Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification
and has threatened to invade the island should it declare independence.
