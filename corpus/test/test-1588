ADB Offers New Loan for Thailand 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has offered to extend an additional
one billion US dollar loan to fund the restructuring of Thailand's
capital market and help maintain the country's economic development
drive.
Thai Finance Ministry Permanent Secretary Sukpachai Pisitvanich said on
Wednesday that the ADB's 10-year structural adjustment loan would carry
an interest rate of seven percent.
This time the ADB will not use its own money but will seek lines of
credit from other funding sources, said Sukpachai.
The new loan offer is in addition to the 1.2 billion dollars the ADB
contributed to the 17.2 billion international rescue package arranged
by the International Monetary Fund last month.
The ADB's first loan would primarily be used to streamline Thailand's
manufacturing and social sectors.
A Finance Ministry source said the ADB's additional loan illustrated
the importance the bank places on capital market development and the
developmnent of new instruments such as futures, hedging and debt
instruments to meet the country's economic growth.
