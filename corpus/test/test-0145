Austrian Chancellor Leaves for Middle East 
Austrian Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima left here Wednesday for
Israel, aiming to revive the stalled Middle East peace process.
Klima was scheduled to meet Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, the Chancellor's Office said.
He will also visit the Palestinian self-rule area of Gaza on Friday and
hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
From July 1, Austria will hold the rotating chairmanship of the
European Union, which is trying to push forward the peace process in
the Middle East.
