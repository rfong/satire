Super Tuesday brazilian wax for lucky Barney
White House, Washington AC/DC - (Shaggy Dog Ass): Lucky First Dog
Barney is set to become the first presidential pooch to celebrate GOP
Super Tuesday hopes with his very own inaugural brazilian wax.
White House rumors say that George Bush himself will do the honors,
eschewing wax for a secret formula hidden behind his very own lips.
Barney is to get the waxing equivalent of a stars 'n' stripes tattoo on
his butt.
"Normally you'd need a jar of WalMart Premium Doggiewax and all the
strips," a White House poodle parlor spokeswoman said today.
"Fortunately we've installed a high-tech laser machine in the parlor
that etches any design you want on the target area of choice. This is
painless and imprints a canine butt with your favorite design.
"All the President then has to do is activate his secret formula while
we hold down the pooch, apply his tongue like a Doggiewax spatula and
hey presto! All the fur simply comes away, better than a canine
depilatory.
"We're thinking of patenting the procedure."
