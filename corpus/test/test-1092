US, Italy pledge closer intelligence cooperation 
US Attorney General John Ashcroft wrapped up a tour of European
capitals Saturday with a pledge of closer cooperation between Italy and
the United States on intelligence sharing in the fight against
terrorism.
Ashcroft held talks with Italy's Interior Minister Claudio Scajola at
the end of a tour which has seen meetings with his counterparts in
London, Berlin and Madrid on developing cooperation on extraditing
terrorist suspects arrested since the September 11 attacks.
"We have decided to strengthen the relationship by bringing back to
life the Italy-US bilateral commission in order to share information
and intelligence between the two countries," Scajola told reporters.
Ashcroft said this would allow both countries "to build on the
bilateral working relationship which is in place and ready to operate
at any time, for the benefit of both countries."
The two officials gave brief statements between the talks and a dinner
hosted by Scajola, and declined questions.
US and Italian officials said later that the special cooperation did
not include any special arrangement to extradite suspects who risked
the death penalty in the United States.
Ashcroft, who returns to Washington on Sunday, has drawn a blank with
his European counterparts on the thorny issue.
Signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights refuse to
extradite suspects to the United States where there is a danger of the
death penalty.
"A close working relationship with Italy is very important to us, and I
am very pleased we have an opportunity to provide even better
cooperation in the future than we have had in the past," Ashcroft said.
He added: "Though I should say, our cooperation with Italy is
unsurpassed in the community of nations."
Scajola is responsible for Italy's anti-terrorist police, who have
arrested 12 men suspected of recruiting for Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda
network.
"Italy stands side by side, shoulder to shoulder with the US, in the
spirit of solidarity with the US people," Scajola said.
