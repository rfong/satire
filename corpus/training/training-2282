Egyptian FM holds talks with Israeli envoy on peace 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa held talks on Thursday with senior
Israeli envoy Dore Gold on "obstacles" hindering the Middle East peace
process, an Egyptian official said.
No other information was disclosed about the meeting, held amid
tensions between the two countries after Egypt accused Israel of trying
to marginalise its role in the peace process.
Gold, policy advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
earlier held more than two hours of talks with Mussa's political
advisor Nabil Fahmy after arriving in Cairo on Wednesday.
"We appreciate the assistance of Egypt in bringing about understanding
between the parties," Gold told reporters after his meeting with Fahmy,
which focused on "ways in which the peace process can be advanced."
"Consultations with Egypt have begun and they are continuing," Gold
said in reference to the deadlocked Arab-Israeli peace process, in
particular the Palestinian track.
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Thursday ruled out an active
role for Egypt in the stalled negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians on a withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron.
"An Egyptian involvement in the peace negotiations ... at a time when
we have not sealed an accord with (Palestinian leader) Yasser Arafat,
can only complicate the talks and set a precedent for the future," he
told reporters.
On Wednesday, President Hosni Mubarak angrily accused Netanyahu of
backtracking on a visit to Israel by Mussa which he said was decided
earlier this month to help advance Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
