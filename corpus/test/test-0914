Shanghai to Establish Silicon Valley 
Shanghai will invest 150 billion yuan (18.1 billion U.S. dollars), or
33 percent of the total industrial input, to develop its electronic
information industry in the next five years.
Half of the money will go to the integrated circuit industry, according
to an integrated circuit development symposium held here.
It is predicted that Shanghai's electronic information industrial value
will exceed 400 billion yuan (48.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 2005, or
one fourth the city's total with an average annual increase of 30
percent.
The city will try to establish a leading position in the country in
such areas as chip-manufacturing and software design by making use of a
manufacturing base with more than ten integrated circuit production
lines, according to the programming at the meeting.
Shanghai's integrated circuit industry accounts for half of the
country's total. In the next five years, the city stresses the
development of seven kinds of products, including integrated circuits,
communications products, computer and Internet products, software,
visual and audio products.
