DPRK Urges U.S. To Be Serious in Nuclear Talks 
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today urged Washington
to take a serious attitude toward the nuclear talks being held in
Berlin.
In a comment carried by the Korean Central News Agency, Pyongyang
warned Washington against insisting that the DPRK accept South Korea
nuclear reactors and putting military pressure on the DPRK by upgrading
the equipment of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.
If the U.S. continues on this course, the DPRK will have no choice but
to go its own way, the comment said.
The comment added that, if the U.S. imposes sanctions against the DPRK,
Pyongyang will take strong measures of self-defense.
During the Berlin talks, the U.S. attempted to write South Korean
light-water reactors into the contract, which the DPRK can only regard
as an attempt to obstruct progress and derail the talks, the comment
said.
