Linguists want Malay as an ASEAN official language 
Linguists from Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei have pledged to campaign
for the adoption of Malay as the second official language of the
10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a report said
Tuesday.
Chief delegates at an annual Malay-language congress which is being
held this year in the Indonesian city of Makassar agreed to approach
national leaders about the campaign, the Jakarta Post said.
Malaysian chief delegate Haji A. Aziz was quoted as saying he was
optimistic that the ASEAN member countries would accept Malay as their
second official language after English.
"There are around 250 million people in ASEAN speaking Malay," Aziz
said.
He said Singapore, which sent two observers to the conference and has a
Malay minority, supports the plan.
Brunei chief delegate Abdul Hakim Mohammad Yasin told the Post that the
delegates were currently "making joint efforts to mobilize support for
the plan."
The head of the Indonesian delegate, Deddy Sugondo, added that support
from other ASEAN members was crucial.
The other six members -- the Philippines, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam,
Cambodia and Myanmar -- do not speak Malay.
