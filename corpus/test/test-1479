Funk Takes Off In Second Round
Fred Funk broke open a close tournament, shooting an 8-under-par 63
before half the field had teed off, and led Jim McGovern by three
strokes after Friday's second round of the Ideon Classic.
Funk's 13-under 129 was two strokes better than the lowest 36-hole
score posted in the 28 previous PGA Tour events at Pleasant Valley
Country Club.
``That's great. I like getting in some sort of record book,'' said
Funk, who has just one victory in seven years on the tour and two
top-10 finishes this year.
McGovern, in one of the late groups, needed a birdie on his last hole
for his second straight 66 and a 10-under 132.
Funk and McGovern were in an 11-way tie for the lead Thursday until
Ronnie Black, one of the late finishers, birdied his 17th hole to end
the day with a one-stroke edge at 65.
On Friday, no one got near Funk all day on the 7,110-yard course.
McGovern said he didn't feel any pressure trying to catch up.
Tied at 134 were Billy Ray Brown, Brian Claar, Gene Sauers, Dan
Forsman, Woody Austin, Steve Lowery, Howard Twitty, Billy Andrade, Dan
Pooley and Jay Williamson.
The group at 135 included Eduardo Romero, who shot 63, and Black, with
a 70. Defending champion Kenny Perry was one of 13 players at 2-under
140, the highest score that made the cut.
Funk was in one of the early groups and let the rest of the players
know they'd have to play well to catch him. He birdied two of his first
three holes and was 3-under for his first nine.
He made par on his 10th hole, then took off with four straight birdies
after putting his approach shots close to the pin. None of those birdie
putts traveled more than 15 feet.
The previous low 36-hole score of 131 in the dlrs 1 million tournament
was shot by Pooley in 1989, Bruce Fleisher in 1991 and Roger Maltbie in
1992. The 63 by Funk and Romero matched Lennie Clements' low second
round for the tournament, shot in 1985.
Funk was 32 when he joined the tour in 1989 after eight years as golf
coach at the University of Maryland. His only victory came in the 1992
Houston Open in which he shot a career-best 62.
He did well in the tournament last year, finishing in a tie for sixth.
There was a two-hour rain delay Friday afternoon, but Funk already had
finished.
