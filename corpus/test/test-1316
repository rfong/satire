US "fighting for Moslems in Bosnia"
The United States, which decided last week to stop enforcing a United
Nations arms embargo against Bosnian government forces, has joined the war
and is helping the Moslem-led regular army, the newspaper The European said
Thurday.
Small teams of plain-clothes personnel working for the CIA are in
Bosnia training Moslems in tactical operations and are providing
satellite intelligence and controlling air traffic, said The European.
"They are teaching the Bosnian Muslims how to fight the Bosnian Serbs,"
the paper quoted an un-named European defence source as saying.
"We are talking about the Americans taking sides. They have in fact
joined the war," the source added.
The paper claimed senior US officers, led by General Charles Boyd,
sealed the deal after meeting an important Bosnian army commander in
the central Bosnian town of Gornji Vakuf.
The meeting resulted in a US decision to launch a covert plan to help
the Bosnian Moslems, according to the paper.
Last week the United States decided unilaterally to cease enforcing the
arms embargo against the Bosnian government -- despite the misgivings
of European and Nato allies.
The number of Americans in Bosnia is small, but the technology at their
disposal could give them a significant say in the course of the
fighting, according to The European
It said that information from US military satellites was being
delivered to the US teams on the ground, and then passed on to Moslem
forces.
The European said the Americas were also masterminding the construction
of a secret airfield in an isolated valley between Visoko and Kakanj in
central Bosnia.
It suggested that the assistance of the US teams had been vital in
recent Bosnian army successes.
The break-out by the Bosnian Moslems from the Bihac pocket in October
and the capture of Kupres reflected skills obtained by outside
training, according to The European.
