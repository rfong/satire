China will be held accountable: Patten 
China's leaders will be held accountable if Hong Kong's government is
disbanded after the colony returns to Beijing's rule in 1997, Governor
Chris Patten said Monday.
Returning here from a five-week vacation he discounted China's recent
threats to wipe out his democratic reforms when it takes over the
territory in mid-1997.
China's National People's Congress has moved to remould Hong Kong's
political contours when the colony reverts to Chinese rule, but Patten
said Monday that the communist authorities would be held accountable by
Hong Kong's residents.
Meeting reporters at Hong Kong's airport, Patten said, "If in 1997,
those (political) arrangements are dismantled, those who take
responsibility for that will have to explain themselves to six million
people here in Hong Kong."
Patten also announced that British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd would
visit the colony September 15-16, just prior to Hurd's scheduled
meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, at the United
Nations in New York.
After becoming Hong Kong's governor in July 1992, Patten introduced a
political reform package to graft democratic mechanisms onto what had
been a system predominantly controlled by the London-appointed
executive here.
Patten's reforms broadened the electoral base for selecting the
Legislative Council and local district boards.
Beijing, branding the measures an attempt to sabotage its takeover, has
vowed to dismantle the entire political system on July 1, 1997, when it
takes over this staunchly capitalist enclave.
