Scrambles by Japanese jet fighters decreased by 48 to 263 in fiscal
1994 which ended March 31, the Air Self-Defence Force (ASDF) said
Friday.
The number is the lowest since 1974. There was only one violation of
Japanese territory by a Russian warplane during fiscal 1994, although
some 87% of the scrambles were against Russian military aircraft,
officials said.
The fall in the number of scrambles is due to a sharp drop in the
number of Russian reconnaissance flights near the Japanese archipelago
in the wake of suspension of annual South Korea-U.S. joint military
drills, they said.
