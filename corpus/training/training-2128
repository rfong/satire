Security Council Voices Concern at Situation in Somalia 
The U.N. Security Council Thursday adopted a presidential statement,
expressing its alarm at "the serious deterioration in the political,
military and humanitarian situation in Somalia and concern at the
reports of increasing external inference in Somalia."
The statement came at the end of the 15-nation Council's closed-door
session on Thursday morning.
"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and
lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia, bearing in mind respect
for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence
and unity of Somalia, in accordance with the principles of the Charter
of the United Nations," the statement said.
"It reiterates that full responsibility for achieving national
reconciliation and for restoring peace rests with the Somali people,"
said the statement.
"The Security Council expresses its support for the activities of the
Standing Committee on Somalia and calls upon all Somali factions to
cease immediately all hostilities and to cooperate with the regional
and other efforts to achieve peace and reconciliation," the statement
said.
The Security Council is "deeply concerned at recent reports of the
illicit delivery of weapons and military equipment to Somalia in
violation of the arms embargo" under relevant Security Council
resolutions, the statement said.
"The Security Council reiterates its call upon States to observe the
arms embargo and to refrain from any actions which might exacerbate the
situation in Somalia," the statement said.
"The Security Council urges all States to contribute generously to the
appeal of the United Nations to ensure continued relief and
rehabilitation efforts in all regions of Somalia, including those aimed
at the strengthening of civil society," the statement added.
