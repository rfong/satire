"That's unfair. It's impossible to hold a protest nowadays without
being in the vicinity of a military funeral."

"Is there any way that bill can be expanded to protect postal workers'
funerals? My dad's was a fiasco."

"I hope that doesn't extend to actors who have played military figures,
because I've got quite the spectacle planned for Sylvester Stallone's
final sendoff."
