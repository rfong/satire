Canada Sees Decline in Post-secondary Education Enrollment 
Canada is the only industrialized country seeing an enrollment decline
in universities, colleges and technical schools, the National Post
newspaper said Tuesday.
Citing a report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the newspaper said enrollment in Canada's
post-secondary institutions dropped by 10 percent between 1995 and
1999, while participation in post-secondary education grew more than 15
percent in the majority of OECD countries.
"It's unusual; Canada is the only country where enrollment has not
increased, even though the trend all over the world is an increase in
demand for tertiary education," Andreas Schleicher, an OECD education
specialist, was quoted as saying.
The decline was attributed to the country's spending cuts, coupled with
government restrictions on private funding.
In Canada, government funding for post-secondary education is about 13
percent below 1995 levels, while private expenditures, largely in the
form of tuition increases, has not been allowed to increase enough to
make up the difference, the newspaper said.
The country ranks number one among OECD nations when it comes to the
percentage of the population between the ages of 25-34 with some kind
of post-secondary education at almost 50 percent, the newspaper said.
