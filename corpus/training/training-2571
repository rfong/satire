Kate Middleton loses £100,000 BBC contract after sex and drugs sting
London - (Dumbass Mess): Desperate royal wannabe Kate Middleton is in
shock today after being booted off a £100,000 BBC Strictly Come Dancing
contract following a successful sex and drugs sting fiasco by a Daily
Tosser undercover reporter.
Middleton was in hiding at her ancestral Nether Regions Wallop home
today after being dropped from the show.
She had been caught on film snorting coke before stripping off and
offering sex to the clandestine reporter for £25,000 at a flat in the
Isle of Dogs, East London.
The footage was sent to the BBC's governor general with a footnote
advising it would posted on a popular internet video site if any
attempt was made at yet another Royal Wedding Humbug deception.
A copy of the videotape has been lodged with the Met's Serious &
DIsorganised Crime Agency.
Middleton is seen lying near-naked on a leopardskin throw, boasting
about having shagged "nearly all the Blues & Royals" and justifying
selling her stick insect body in order to pay the rent on her lavish
new Chelsea spread.
There has been no commonet from Buckingham Palace save a footman's
giggle that her absence at today's Westmonster Abbey Thanksgiving
Service was a clear sign she'd been booted out of the Puppet Monarchy's
clique of cronies for good.
