Egypt, Israel agree to patch up relations, strive for peace by Lamia Radi 
Egypt and Israel agreed here on Thursday to patch up the rift in their
relations and to step up efforts to save the troubled Middle East peace
process.
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said he was ready "to cross oceans
and go to the North Pole," to achieve a comprehensive peace in the
region and secure progress in the negotiations with the Palestinian
Authority.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa expressed "satisfaction" with his
talks with Levy, and added: "I trust that the visit of Mr. Levy to
Cairo today will contribute positively to this progress that we are
hoping for.
"We will be really reassured only when we see real progress and respect
for the past agreements" struck between Palestinians and Israelis,
Mussa cautioned.
"What the minister (Levy) told us has been satisfying. We will wait and
see," Mussa added in reference to the long-delayed Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron.
Mussa and Levy met for 90 minutes at the foreign ministry after more
than 90 minutes of talks between President Hosni Mubarak and the
Israeli diplomat at the presidential palace.
"I have listened to some very important statements and I have briefed
(the Egyptians) on some things which I consider important," Levy said
after his lengthy talks with the Egyptian officials.
"Our joint approach is to push forward the peace process," he said.
"Naturally there are difficulties which we will try, which we are
always trying, to surmount in order to guarantee security for all..
"Problems can be resolved through discussions," he stressed.
Saying there was "no alternative" to peace, Levy added: "I am sure we
will succeed ... to push forward the peace process. This is the wish of
the majority, if not all, the people in Israel."
He also denied that Israel was setting new conditions in its
negotiations with the Palestinians.
After emerging from talks with Mubarak, Levy paid tribute to Egypt's
"essential" role in the peace process. "Peace between our two countries
can be an example which could serve all parties," he said.
Levy thanked Mubarak for his "warm welcome" and described Mussa as a
"dear friend," avoiding any reference to the often heated exchanges
between the two countries in recent weeks.
