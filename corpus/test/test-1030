UN Lists Top Investment Opportunities in East 
Agriculture, fishing and aquiculture, forestry, mining, quarrying and
tourism offer the best investment opportunities in the three East
African countries, a latest United Nations report has said.
Country Presentation in the World Development Report issued by the
World Bank was published on local newspapers Wednesday.
Tanzania leads East African states for investment opportunities in
fishing and aquaculture, forestry as well as mining and quarrying.
In tourism Tanzania paired with Uganda in widening investment
opportunities for the region, while Uganda identified finance and
insurance as well as storage and transport as offering substantial
investment opportunities.
"Textiles, leather, clothing, pharmaceuticals and chemical products can
offer particularly good investment opportunities in Kenya and Uganda,"
the report indicated.
The U.N. report called on the three governments to create good
investment environment by improving roads and telecommunications
infrastructure, power and occupational skills development programs.
