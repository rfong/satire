China to Standardize Entrance Exam
China will standardize the entrance examination for a Master of
Business Administration (MBA) next year, said Zhao Chunjun, deputy
director of the National MBA Education Supervisory Committee.
The subcommittee, part of the State Council's Academic Degrees
Committee, will enlist 26 universities to help draft the uniform test,
according to today's China Daily.
Those universities will be the only institutions where students can
earn MBA degrees in China, the paper said.
The test, called GRK (Guanli Ruxue Kaoshi), will measure students'
aptitude in English, Chinese and logic, mathematics, management and
political economics.
Each university will administer separate tests in political economics.
Application requirements for undergraduates, who previously needed four
years work experience, will be eased. Under the new terms,
undergraduate students must have at least three years work experience,
and graduate students must have at least two.
