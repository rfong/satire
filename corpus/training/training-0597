New WTO director urges Japan and USA to settle car dispute 
Renato Ruggiero, who started work as the new director of the World
Trade Organisation (WTO) Monday, called on Japan and the United States
to settle their differences over car imports.
"The best idea is for Japan and the United States to solve immediately
or as soon as possible their problems", said Ruggiero, a former Italian
foreign trade minister.
"That's what everybody wishes, and certainly what I wish," she said.
Japan and the United States were due to resume talks in Vancouver
Monday aimed at settling their dispute.
Washington has said that if the talks failed it would impose immediate
unilateral sanctions against Japan.
Ruggiero, whose first day began quietly, was appointed WTO director in
March after disagreement over who was to head the new world trade body.
