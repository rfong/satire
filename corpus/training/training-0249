The announcement came shortly after the body of a third hostage was
dumped from the plane onto the tarmac at Algiers airport.
French Premier Edouard Balladur conferred with Algerian President
Liamine Zeroual, ''who authorized the Air France plane to take off
without delay toward French territory,'' said a communique by the
French Foreign Ministry.
There was no immediate word on exactly when the plane would take off.
