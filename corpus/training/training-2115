Shandong's "Fruitful" Export-Oriented Economy 
East China's Shandong Province enjoyed fruitful results in its
export-oriented economy during the past five years. Total foreign trade
hit almost 43 billion US dollars.
Provincial foreign trade last year accounted for more than a quarter of
all local production.
The five years saw the province give the go-ahead to 25,300
foreign-funded projects, attracting contractual overseas investment
worth 29 billion US dollars
Overseas investment came from more than 80 countries and regions during
the 1991-1995 period - compared to investors from 25 countries and
regions during the previous five-year period.
More than 25 percent of local total investment in fixed assets stemmed
from overseas funds.
The province has three state-level economic technological development
zones in Qingdao, Yantai, and Weihai, and at least 50 province-level
zones across the whole area. This has helped to promote local economic
contacts with foreign countries.
Besides an annual foreign trade fair hosted in Qingdao, the province
also held trade promotion activities in Japan, the United States, the
Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, and Germany in the 1991-1995 period.
