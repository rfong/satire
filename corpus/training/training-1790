Railway line for Caucasus will avoid Chechnya 
After nearly two years of bitter fighting to keep Chechnya within
Russia, authorities are now considering building a new railway line to
avoid it, the Izvestia daily reported Tuesday.
It said Railways Minister Anatoly Zaitsev met railway bosses from the
north Caucasus region to discuss linking southern Russia with Kislyar
and Kisilyurt, in the republic of Daghestan, as well as Armenia,
Azerbaijan and Georgia.
The line conspicuously avoids Chechnya, although the present railway
out of Daghestan passes through the major Chechen towns of Argun and
Gudermes and its capital Grozny.
Izvestia quoted Vladimir Brezhnev, head of the Transtroi company, as
saying the project had been in the pipeline for more than 10 years.
The ceasefire and resulting peace accord which ended the 20-month war
in Chechnya late last month, after the loss of up to 40,000 lives, gave
the project new life.
Izvestia said the speed at which the plan was revived "indicates the
Russian leadership is probably preparing to make political decisions on
Chechnya, aimed at minimising the importance of its strategic
position."
