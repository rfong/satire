Greek Ruling Party's Congress Begins in Athens 
The 6th Panhellenic Socialist Movement's (PASOK) congress began on
Thursday with the observance of a minute's silence for the victims of
terrorism.
The party leader and Prime Minister Costas Simitis condemned the
terrorist attack on the United States in his opening speech.
Terrorism was a crime, he stressed, with no excuse, no alibi, no moral
basis and no political ideology.
Simitis sketched out the broader goals of his government, saying that
these would be focused on economic growth, a new social state and a
stronger international position for Greece.
He appealed for unity and called on delegates to make the congress a
launching pad for the party's recovery and course to victory. He asked
them for a clear and strong mandate and clear- cut answers to the
party's dilemmas, so that it could continue its work unhindered.
The four-day PASOK congress, originally scheduled for March 2002, was
brought forward six months to renew and update Simitis' mandate after a
controversial social insurance reform bill showed PASOK slipping in
opinion pools.
Commenting on the start of the congress earlier, government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said the decisions discussed and taken there would
determine developments in the country.
