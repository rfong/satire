Vietnam to Boost Leather, Footwear Sales 
Vietnam's leather and footwear sector has been taking a series of
measures to boost sales of its products inside and outside the country,
according to a report of Vietnam News Agency on Monday.
One of the measures is a visit to Russia this month by a business
mission of Ho Chi Minh City's Leather and Footwear Association to seek
opportunities to sell their footwear in the market after a long period
of absence.
Meanwhile, the country's Leather and Footwear Corporation (LFC) and its
subsidiary companies continued to promote trade and inquire into
overseas markets through domestic and foreign surveys, fairs and
exhibitions.
Other businesses continued maintaining their traditional markets,
including the European Union and Japan with high-quality and new-style
products.
Other measures taken by the LFC to raise its products' competitiveness
are in-depth investment in advance technology, streamlining businesses
and upgrade of tanning facilities.
In the first quarter of this year, Vietnam earned 406 million U. S.
dollars from exports of footwear, the same figure of last year' s
corresponding period.
