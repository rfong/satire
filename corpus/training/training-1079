Rafsanjani criticizes US troop deployment in Kuwait 
Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani reprimanded Kuwait on
Tuesday for allowing US troops to be deployed in the Gulf Arab state.
"The region's countries should not provide an excuse for the presence
of foreign countries in the area as they seek nothing but their
illegitimate interests, he told Kuwaiti Communications and Power
Minister Jassem al-Aoun.
Rafsanjani, cited by Tehran radio, called for regional cooperation to
ensure "sustained security."
Aoun, who arrived here Monday, delivered a message from the Kuwaiti
emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah.
Some 3,000 American troops arrived in Kuwait last week to join 1,200
others who have been training since August in the oil-rich emirate
which Iraq occupied in 1990-91.
US President Bill Clinton ordered the buildup in the Gulf region,
including sending extra ground troops and a second aircraft carrier,
the USS Enterprise, after Iraq fired missiles at US planes flying over
Iraq two weeks ago.
Iraqi president Saddam Hussein vowed to shoot down US warplanes after
US forces hit his southern air defenses and expanded the southern
no-fly zone in retaliation for his intervention into northern Kurdish
safe havens on August 31.
The Kuwaiti official will also travel to Turkey, Lebanon and Libya to
explain his country's position on the latest crisis in the Gulf.
