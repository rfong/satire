Water could cause Egyptian pyramid's collapse
The Maidum pyramid south of Cairo could collapse because its foundation
has been endangered by the irrigation of a nearby forest, Supreme
Council of Antiquities secretary general Ali Hassan said Tuesday.
"I've filed a complaint with the agriculture ministry against Beni Suef
province which is expanding a forest up to the archeological perimeter
of the pyramid," which is about 75 kilometers (47 miles) south of
Cairo, he said.
"The province has taken over 10 feddans (4.2 hectares or 10.4 acres) in
the perimeter and planted trees 200 meters (656 feet) from the
pyramids. The limestone base is at risk of eroding and the pyramid of
collapsing, because of this forest's irrigation," he added.
The Maidum pyramid was built by Huni, the last ruler of the third
kingdom (2700 B.C. to 2620 B.C.) and enlarged by Snefu, the first
pharaoh of the fourth kingdom (2620 B.C. to 2500 B.C.), who gave it a
new limestone coating which later disappeared.
