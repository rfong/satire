Israel, Palestinians Agree to Stop Violence 
Israel and the Palestinians reached early Thursday morning an
understanding on security cooperation aimed at ending the violence that
plagued the region since September, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
office said.
Meanwhile, the Israeli cabinet held a meeting on the latest conflicts
and decided not to take any overreactions, a spokesman of the office
told Xinhua.
The deal, which was reached at a meeting between Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Minister of Regional
Cooperation Shimon Peres in Gaza and is now under debate in Israeli
parliament, is expected to be announced later in the day.
The spokesman said that the two sides have agreed to put a halt to
violence, and renew the bilateral security cooperation.
He also said that Barak thanked Peres for his efforts in the Gaza
meeting.
He quoted Barak as expressing the hope that the measures agreed on
Thursday will finally ended the conflicts.
The agreement is within the framework of an Israel-Palestine peace
accord reached in an emergency Middle East summit in Sharm el-Sheikh,
Egypt, last month. Besides Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
the summit was attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, the
spokesman said.
The Sharm el-Sheikh peace accord failed to put an end to violent
clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces. So far at least 163
people have died, mostly Palestinians.
