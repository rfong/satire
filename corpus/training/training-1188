Nigeria to Host International AIDS Conference 
An international conference on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS), which has so far killed 11.5 million people of sub-Saharan
Africa, or 83 percent of all AIDS deaths worldwide, is to be held in
Lagos next month to stem the tide of the HIV pandemic in the African
continent.
A leading Nigerian newspaper, The Guardian, Monday reported that the
conference was organized by the Fund for International AIDS Research
and Education (FIARE).
The forthcoming conference will provide a forum for discussion of TB
and AIDS clinical trials in the African settings, and to develop pilot
STD programs targeting counseling for AIDS prevention, behavioral
assessments and treatment modalities, according to FIARE'S symposium
organizing committee.
It is estimated that about 2.8 million Nigerians, representing 5.4
percent of the country's population between the ages 14 and 49, are
said to be infected with the virus, and more than 4.9 million will be
infected with the HIV virus in the next five years.
According to a recent survey, HIV prevalence rate in Nigeria has
continued to increase at an alarming rate and the country now ranks
second within sub-Saharan Africa for the number of HIV-infected adults,
despite efforts to contain the epidemic.
Nigeria has entered a stage where the epidemic will increase at an
exponential rate unless adequate national and regional responses are
mounted to stem its spread, added the survey.
