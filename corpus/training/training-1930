Greek police rescue ship carrying illegal immigrants
Greek authorities on Saturday intercepted a Turkish ship carrying 291
illegal immigrants that had run into a violent storm in bitterly cold
weather off the island of Evvoia, northeast of Athens, the merchant navy
ministry said.
The ministry said the Hilmi Dede, a vessel of around 40 metres (130
feet) was escorted to the port of Rafina, where the immigrants, mainly
Iraqi Kurds, disembarked.
There were 26 women and eight children among them, authorities said.
The Turkish captain, who was arrested, said the ship, which had been
battered by heavy seas and cold winds since Friday, had set out from
the Turkish port of Izmir.
The passengers were being sheltered at a covered stadium in the town,
where they were given first aid and food and blankets while authorities
decided what should be done with them.
The latest incident comes after Greek authorities were called upon to
rescue a Turkish ship carrying 246 illegal immigrants which got into
difficulties off the south coast of Crete on Thursday.
After a rescue operation lasting nearly 48 hours, authorities arrested
two suspected people traffickers believed to have been in charge of the
mostly Iraqi Kurdish crew.
Greece is a favoured transit route for economic migrants and illegal
immigrants, particularly from Africa and Asia, hoping to gain entry
into economically prosperous Europe.
The country is one of signatories of the EU's Schengen "open borders"
agreement countries, which means that once on Greek territory,
immigrants can enjoy relatively easy access to other Schengen states.
Greece has recently been hit by an influx of immigrants, many of them
coming via neighbouring Turkey.
