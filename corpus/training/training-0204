U.S. Tries to Settle Dispute Over Mideast Deal 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright intervened Tuesday in a
dispute between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over
counter-terrorism measures on the West Bank.
"The Palestinians have met their responsibilities" by submitting a plan
to combat terrorism, but "there are other problems we are working on,"
said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
Albright spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone
Tuesday. On Monday, she called to Netanyahu after a call to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
"We are aware of the problem," Rubin said after Albright talked to
Netanyahu, but he declined to give any further details.
The U.S. spokesman reiterated the administration's position that the
agreement, in which Israel is to swap West Bank land for tighter
security, had gone into force Monday.
Rubin also said U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and other State Department
officials would go to the region shortly.
Their assignment is to try to set the stage for further
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and to see whether Israel and Syria
can open peace talks.
In Jerusalem, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Israel
was holding out for a list of 30 Palestinians the Authority had
promised to arrest as part of the land-for-security agreement signed
last month in Washington.
Mordechai said Israel was also seeking a timetable for the arrests.
Netanyahu, meanwhile, postponed a Cabinet meeting that was to have
considered ratifying the accord. Netanyahu said he had ordered the
delay because the Palestinians had not submitted a complete blueprint
for fighting terrorism.
