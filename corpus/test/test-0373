Khmer Rouge kill seven ethnic Vietnamese 
Khmer Rouge guerrillas launched a night attack on a small fishing
village in central Cambodia and shot dead seven ethnic Vietnamese in
cold blood, a Vietnamese residents' association official said Friday.
"They went to the people and asked them if they were Khmer or
Vietnamese and if they did not answer clearly in Cambodian, they shot
them," the official said.
The guerrillas came in two boats early Thursday and launched the
surprise attack on the small, primarily ethnic Vietnamese, fishing
village of Bean Chhararlay in Kampong Chhnang province around 80
kilometers (50 miles) north of the captial.
The seven dead -- including a six-month-old girl and a two-year-old boy
-- and three of the injured came from two fishing families.
The official said the gunmen wore mixed uniforms and the villagers at
first thought they were government soldiers.
But the guerrillas then opened fire, he said, adding that a local
village chief identified some of them as Khmer Rouge.
Other families managed to jump into the water or run away, he said.
"It all happened very fast, they arrived, starting shooting and then
went away," he said.
The guerrillas did not attempt to steal anything, he said, adding that
it was a direct attack on the ethnic Vietnamese community.
The official said the killings happened in an area where the owner of
the fishing concession paid protection money to the Khmer Rouge.
"We are very worried because the killings here haven't happened inside
a concession area before," he said.
Ethnic Vietnamese were often killed or robbed when they strayed into
remote waters to fish, he said.
The official complained that the local authorities did little to
protect the Vietnamese communities and that no investigations had been
carried out on previous occasions when Khmer Rouge guerrillas killed
ethnic Vietnamese.
"They just write it down but nothing happens," he said.
If somone is killed in a remote area, "the families then have to pay
someone to go look for the body," he said.
