Fugitive Arrested in Brazil for Fatal Arson in Seattle 
A fugitive sought for a January fire that killed four firefighters was
arrested has been arrested in Brazil.
Martin Pang was taken into custody in the Rio de Janiero beach resort
section of Copacabana, said Rogerio Said, a Brazilian federal police
officer.
Pang, 39, was charged with four counts of murder and arson after the
Jan. 5 fire at his parent's warehouse. Investigators have said that
Pang had hoped to gain financially from the fire, presumably from
insurance.
Pang apparently fled to Brazil from Southern California, where he had
been living, in late February.
The arrest came almost immediately after a warrant for Pang's arrest,
requested more than three weeks ago by U.S. authorities, was signed by
a judge on Brazil's Supreme Court, according to Said.
``We had already spotted him and were waiting only for the arrest
warrant,'' he said.
Pang recently sent a videotape to a Seattle television station, saying
he was innocent.
``I had nothing to do with it except joking about it,'' Pang said in a
15-minute videotape, part of which was shown on KING-TV last Saturday.
Pang's attorney, John Henry Browne, did not return a message left with
his answering service Thursday.
Mayor Norm Rice, in Washington, D.C., for a national mayors'
conference, said he was pleased Pang had been arrested ``and we can
begin the next chapter in bringing closure and justice to this
situation.''
It was unclear whether Pang would be extradited or deported.
