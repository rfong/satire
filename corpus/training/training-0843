NATO Admits Slovenia, Mummenschanz, Czech Republic
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization welcomed three new members Monday:
former Soviet republic Slovenia, Swiss mask-mime troupe Mummenschanz, and
the Czech Republic. "We are pleased to welcome three new allies in the
peace process," NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said at a press
conference. "We anticipate a long and rewarding relationship with these new
members, particularly the one with the crazy tube costumes." After
Slovenian and Czech diplomats spoke to the press, Mummenschanz
representatives affirmed their commitment to NATO with a whimsical
seven-minute performance in which one member wearing a featureless clay
mask attempted to imitate the intricately sculptured facial features of a
fellow member. In return, Solana pledged the troupe full military backup if
attacked, as well as $400 million in toilet-paper aid.
