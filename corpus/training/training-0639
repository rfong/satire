Ali Mahdi supporters defect to join Aidid's government 
A group of politicians from Somali warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed's faction
have defected to join the self-styled "government" of his rival Mohamed
Farah Aidid, Aidid's radio said Friday.
Following the defection from Ali Mahdi's United Somali Congress,
dominated by his Abgal clansmen, Aidid nominated four "cabinet
ministers" from the Abgal clan and appointed Abdurahman Gabow Mohamud,
also an Abgal, his fifth deputy president.
Aidid, a member of the Habr Gedir clan who controls south Mogadishu,
also nominated a "governor of Mogadishu" from the Abgal clan, the radio
said.
Political observers here said the defections are likely to lead to an
armed conflict between Ali Mahdi loyalists in north Mogadishu and
supporters of the defectors.
The new officials were sworn in in the central town of Baidoa last week
at a ceremony attended by Aidid, the Libyan ambassador Mustafa Salim
and the Sudanese charge d'affaires Khalifullah Ibrahim.
Aidid welcomed the defectors to his "government", which he formed after
his supporters declared him president last June, saying "brothers can
never be kept apart forever".
