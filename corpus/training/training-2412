US Secretary Powell says India-Pakistan war is 'nothing inevitable'
India's prime minister made an offer to perform joint patrols on the border
with Pakistan. "There is nothing inevitable about war," Powell told US
broadcaster National Public Radio. Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee suggested Wednesday that the two countries, with a million
soldiers engaged in sporadic firefights along the so-called Line of
Control, instead engage in joint patrols as a confidence-building measure
that could promote real dialogue. "There is a little less activity going on
along the line of control," Powell said, as one indication that tensions
might be easing. Lower tensions do not mean lower vigilance of the
situation between the two nuclear powers, Powell said. "It is still a very
dangerous situation," he told NPR. "It is still a crisis." India wants
Pakistan to prevent Kashmir separatists from entering India, which says it
has been victim of terrorist attacks. Pakistani officials gave a guarded
response to Vajpayee's offer. kd/fk
