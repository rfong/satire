Russian business union meets prosecutor to protest "strong arm" tactics 
A businessmen's union grouping Russia's largest enterprises met
Prosecutor-General Vladimir Ustinov on Monday to protest against
heavy-handed investigations into economic crimes, it announced on
Tuesday.
"We expressed our concern about certain actions of law enforcement
agencies in economic investigations and the situation surrounding the
Sibur and Gazprom companies," said Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of
Industrialists and Russian Entrepeneurs.
Ustinov agreed that the poor image of Russian business abroad was
partly caused by these "spectacular" inquiries, according to the
union's statement.
The meeting, which lasted more than two hours, followed charges of
"abuse of power" on January 18 against two directors of the
petrochemical company Sibur, a subsidiary of Gazprom natural gas giant,
in relation to asset-stripping.
Gazprom first deputy chairman has also been placed under house arrest
since mid-January in connexion with the same affair.
