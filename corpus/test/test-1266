Quality of China's Vegetable Seeds Needs Improvement 
China has world's largest area of vegetable cultivation, growing most
vegetable varieties. However, the qualified rate of the vegetable seeds
is only 57.8 percent, according to a recent selective examination.
The spot check, conducted by the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision (SBQTS) among 45 kinds of Chinese cabbage and kale seeds
from 33 seed companies across China, showed that only 26 kinds were up
to standard.
The qualified rate of Chinese cabbage reached 68.9 percent, and the
ratio for kale was only 37.5 percent. Seeds of state-owned enterprises
were found to be of higher quality than those of private companies, the
examination revealed. The major quality problems include germination
and low purity.
China has a vegetable cultivation area of about 6.9 million hectares,
and vegetables are a major part of the Chinese diet. Incomplete
statistics show that the country has several thousand seed companies,
and over 60 percent deal in vegetable seeds.
SBQTS officials said that after China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, Chinese seed enterprises will face much stiffer
competition, and must increase the quality of their seeds.
The bureau and Chinese agricultural departments will to penalize
enterprises which fail to meet state standards.
