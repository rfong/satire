Fair Polls Strengthened Indonesian Currency: Minister 
The fair and smooth election coupled with the right economic policies
have led to the recent strengthening of the rupiah, Coordinating
Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said
Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters before attending a limited cabinet meeting here,
Ginandjar said the government had never thought that the rupiah would
regain strength rather quickly.
"We are happy with this development and we hope that rupiah would
further strengthen gradually. It would be good if its value remains at
the 7,000 level but we are optimistic that it would further improve,"
he said.
The rupiah was closing at 7,280/7,300 to the U.S. dollar here on
Wednesday, compared to 7,160/7,190 per dollar on Tuesday which was the
highest level since October last year.
Ginandjar said the government was expecting the rupiah to get stronger
if the June 7 election turned out to be fair and peaceful.
He attributed the positive trend to two main factors -- the
government's right economic policies and the gradual improvement in the
country's political stability.
He predicted that the rupiah would improve to a level lower than 7,000
until the general session of the People's Consultative Assembly late
this year.
Ginandjar however noted that the government prefers a gradual
strengthening of the rupiah to a quick one which could hamper the
country's export activities.
Banking interest rates are also expected to fall following the
strengthening of the rupiah, he added.
A few months ahead of former president Soeharto's resignation in May
1998, the rupiah plunged to 15,000 against the U.S. dollar. Soeharto
was replaced by B.J. Habibie on May 21 last year amid mounting student
demonstrations and bloody unrests hitting many parts of the country.
