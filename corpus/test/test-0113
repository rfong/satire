US confirms it fired first in Cap Haitien shootout
US Marines were the first to open fire during a shootout that left 10
Haitians dead and one seriously wounded in Cap Haitien, a US military
spokesman said Sunday.
A US patrol "saw a gesture by one individual with an Uzi machine gun,
he went to raise the Uzi machine gun. He (the US Marine) took that
individual out and the firefight broke out," said Colonel Tom Jones,
commander of the US Marine Air Ground Task Force in Haiti, said from
Cap Haitien.
Saturday's firefight at the Cap Haitien police headquarters was the
first time US forces opened fire since they landed in Haiti last Monday
to secure the nation for the return of president Jean-Bertrand Aristide
who fled after a September 1991 coup.
According to Jones, the incident broke out after protesters against the
ruling military regime were exchanging words with personnel in the
police building.
Two figures from the police headquarters "were becoming quite vocal
with the (anti-government) group" and "they were gesturing with their
pistols," and trying to "intimidate the forces in the crowd," Jones
said.
"We have told our forces we are not to use deadly force unless
absolutely necessary, but if they have to use deadly force, they will
use it emphatically and unhesitatingly," Jones added.
Conflicting reports over who fired first had surrounded the incident.
The US military initially said the Haitians had. A Cap Haitien police
officer told AFP Saturday that the US troops were the first to open
fire.
The Cap Haitien police officer said the US troops saw a Haitian
policeman in civilian clothes who touched his belt, a gesture he said
the marines took as threatening and they opened fire.
