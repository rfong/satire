Zambia, Angola to Discuss Border Security 
Zambia and Angola will this month convene a Joint Permanent Commission
(JPC) on Defense and Security to discuss mutual security concerns.
The Angolan and Zambian governments are making arrangements to hold the
commission before month end to sort out some security problems
affecting the border areas between the two countries, said Zambian
Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa here on Tuesday.
This will be the second such meeting this year following attacks by
Angolan soldiers on the Zambian border area. The first was held in
Luanda in February.
There has been rising tension between Zambia and Angola raising concern
between the two governments.
Hundreds of Zambians have fled their border villages since the
incursions by armed men believed to be Angolans started last year.
Last week an armed Angolan soldier was captured in Zambezi District of
Zambia after an exchange of fire with Zambian army in which a Zambian
soldier and two civilians were injured.
