Pharmaceutical Company Gives Beethoven Sculptures To Musicians 
A pharmaceutical company, run by musicians and music lovers, has bought
150 sculptures of Beethoven to give to music societies, colleges and
individuals in China.
The 28-mm high bronze sculpture was created by Prof. Zeng Zhushao, who
has done works of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and former Peking University
president, Cai Yuanpei.
Beijing's Music Weekly bought the rights to the sculpture and had 170
copies made to commemorate the 170th anniversary of Beethoven's death
last year. No.001 has gone to the Hong Kong Symphony Orchestra, while
others have gone to the Chinese playwright Wu Zuguang, the director and
conductor-in-chief of the Beijing Symphony Orchestra Tan Lihua, and to
some schools that actively promote after-class musical activities.
The Sino-Canadian Shaanxi Wenhai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. bought the
remaining 150 sculptures. Xiu Jun, president of the three-year-old
joint venture, graduated from the Tianjin Conservatory of Music with a
degree in composition and was once a violinist in a local song and
dance ensemble before going into business.
General manager Lin Zishen, of Hong Kong, said he is just a music lover
but says that his wife, who studied singing for some time at the
Shanghai Conservatory of Music, is connected with musicians, and the
company's sales manager is a professional sax player.
