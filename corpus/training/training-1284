S.Lanka Business Community Modernizes Industries 
The Sri Lanka's industrial community has imported 1.16 billion U.S.
dollars worth of investment goods during the first 10 months of 1998 to
modernize existing industries and a few new industries, officials said
Tuesday.
According to an Industries Development Ministry official, this capital
formation will immensely help strengthen the industrial sector and to
meet the challenges in emerging tariff free markets.
Sri Lankan industrialists have also imported 2.42 billion dollars worth
of intermediate goods during the same period for expansion of
production in their factories, the official said.
In the past four years, the ministry has approved over 505 industrial
projects with investments worth 500 million dollars under an Advanced
Technology Tax Incentive Scheme.
The main aim of providing massive concessions to local industries is to
equip them with modern machinery and equipment to compete in the world
market, said the official.
The proposed "investor incentives for 1998" have further stimulated the
industrial sector in areas such as rubber goods, ceramic products,
electronic goods, and gem and jewelry products, the ministry official
said.
