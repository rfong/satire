Norway Forms New Government 
Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg announced his new government
in Oslo on Friday, said reports from Oslo.
Speaking to reporters after presenting his government to King Harald V,
Stoltenberg said his 18-member team, including 10 men and eight women,
was "large" and included some of Norway's most experienced politicians.
Stoltenberg, who celebrated his 41st birthday Thursday, has become the
country's youngest-ever prime minister. Some of his cabinet members are
also very young: Oil and Energy Minister Olav Akselsen is 34, Justice
Minister Hanne Harlem is 35, while Finance Minister Karl Eirik
Schjoett-Pedersen is 40.
Thorbjoern Jagland, 49, a former prime minister and head of the Labour
Party, was named the foreign minister.
Stoltenberg was asked by the king last week to form a new government
after former prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, who came to power in
March 1997, lost a vote of confidence in parliament and resigned.
All the ministers are from the Labour Party. The new government has a
minority of seats in parliament, 65 of 165, and will depend heavily on
cooperation with other parties to survive.
The next legislative elections in Norway are scheduled for September
2001.
