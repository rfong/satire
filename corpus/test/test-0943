ATP tries to pep up men's tennis 
Umpires at this year's Wimbledon championships may be asking spectators
for quiet during rallies for the last time.
A rule change announced here on Sunday by the governing body of men's
professional tennis, the ATP Tour, will allow "spectators to
spontaneously react during a point as long as it is not intended to
distract players".
This is one of four changes to be phased in from July 18. The package
is designed to answer criticisms of the men's game as increasingly
boring.
"We feel these rule changes will make the game more enjoyable for
spectators and viewers and will help better convey the excitement and
appeal of men's professional tennis," said ATP Tour chief executive
Mark Miles.
The other changes, endorsed by Player and Tournament Councils, reduce
the time between points from 25 to 20 seconds, allow microphones to
pick up conversations between players and officials and permit
spectators in the upper tiers of stadia to to move in and out during
play.
World number one Pete Sampras said: "I think there is too much
towelling off and there are too many other delays. I'm glad the Tour is
looking to improve the game for fans."
