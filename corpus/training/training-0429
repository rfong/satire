The War In Chechnya
During last week's State Of The Union Address, President Clinton called
upon Russia to pull out of Chechnya, where, for the past six months,
war has raged between Russia and a band of Chechen rebels. What do you
think about this worsening international crisis?

"The U.S. should waste no time in condemning General Mashimkov's brutal
occupation of the city of Plovsk in the Chechen province of Azgakasban.
Okay, I made that up."
Old Man
Isaac Roth,

"Who cares about some stupid little war way off in the Caucasus
Mountains? Hey, wait... Those people are Caucasians! The U.S. must send
in troops at once!"
Young Man
Pat Eisenreich,
Machinist
"I feel close to this issue on a personal level, as I have a next-door
neighbor who is from a country I've never heard of and don't care
about."

Lee Wooton,

"I need George Orwell to break this down into livestock terms for me."
Young Woman
Jennifer Huhn,
Massage Therapist
"Chechnya? So much is said about these itinerant mountain goatherders
who rebelled against Russia, but little is ever mentioned of the
innocent goats, caught in the crossfire."
Old Woman
Jane Mortman,
Guidance Counselor
"I'm sorry. I can't think of the situation clearly without that 'I feel
like Chechen tonight, like Chechen tonight!' song going through my
head."
