US general optimistic about disarming Haitians 
US troops are in the process of disarming Haitians, but there still is
a long way to go, the top US general said Sunday, hours after a
firefight in which US marines killed nine Haitians.
"I am under no illusion that we are going to collect all weapons,"
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General John Shalikashvili told
CBS television.
But "the more weapons we get off the street, the better," he said,
revealing plans for a weapons buy-back program like the one used after
the 1989 US invasion of Panama to decrease the number of firearms in
circulation.
Shalikashvili did not say how much the United States might be willing
to spend on such a program.
He said US disarming efforts in Haiti first focussed on the army's
heavy weaponry, and also would take place on a case-by-case basis and
through a buy-back scheme.
But referring to armed paramilitary groups aligned with the Haitian
military and police, which human rights group blame for hundreds of
deaths since Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was toppled in
September 1991, the general distanced US forces from the task.
"We really want the Haitians to do that disarming," Shalikashvili said.
He did not disclose further details about such plans.
In Port-au-Prince, US Marines seized control early Sunday of police
headquarters in the northern Haitian town of Cap Haitien after an
overnight shootout in which US forces killed nine Haitians.
It was the first clash between US troops and Haitians since the US
military force began its mission in Haiti six days ago to prepare for
the return of exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
US military spokeswoman Lieutenant Colonel Susan Randall said it was
not immediately clear whether all those killed were Haitian policemen,
and US forces arrested five others confiscating two 38mm pistols and an
M1 rifle.
Shalikashvili said the incident began with Haitians engaging in "verbal
abuse" of patrolling US forces, and then escalated into a shootout.
A Cap Haitien police officer claimed US marines opened fire first when
they spotted a Haitian policeman touching his belt, a gesture they
viewed as threatening.
