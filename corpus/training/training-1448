Former Indian foreign minister Swaran Singh died here Sunday after a
heart attack, the Press Trust of India said.
Singh, 87, figured in the cabinets of India's first prime minister
Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter Indira Gandhi during a distinguished
career spanning three decades, the news agency said.
He headed the foreign ministry in 1972 when India and Pakistan signed
the Simla peace agreement a year after they fought a short but bitter
war.
