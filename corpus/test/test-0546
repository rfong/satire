Bush, Ahern tout Ireland-US ties
US President George W. Bush and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern on
Wednesday vowed to stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the US-led "war on
terrorism" as well as the Northern Ireland peace process.
"The people of Northern Ireland know the threat of terror and they know
the value of peace," Bush said as he welc terror strikes on the United
States, saying: "We appreciate your help in a just and vital cause."
"We will support in ns of civilized society," promised Ahern.
The two leaders also welcomed progress in ending violence in Northern
Ireland since the 1998 "Good Friday" peace accord aimed at ending
decades of bloody sectarian conflict, also known as "the troubles."
"Our hope grows ever stronger that we've at least drawn a line under
those dark times in our history," said Ahern. "We know that more work
remains to be done.
"The good citizens of Northern Ireland and the leaders here today have
demonstrated a fierce determination: the next generation must not grow
up amid 'the troubles,'" said Bush. "Th*%.Jdd States stands ready to do
its part."
"For all communities in Northern Ireland, there's only one future, and
it must be a future of peace. Peacemaking can be hard work, like
planting in hard soil," he added. "And as the Irish proverb tells us,
'you'll never plough a field by turning it over in your mind.'"
Bush spoke at length of Irish and Irish-American contributions to the
United States, noting that the White House was designed by an
Irish-American immigrant and inspired by Dublin's Leinster House.
He also cited the storied Kennedy family of US politics; the five
Sullivan brothers, killed together in World War II; and frontiersman
Davy Crockett.
Surveying the crowd at the White House St Patrick's Day reception, Bush
extended the traditional greeting: "A hundred thousand welcomes to you
all."
The US leader, frequently tongue-tied in English, drew warm laughter
from the crowd when he added: "I probably am not going to try to say
that in Gaelic. But I have learned to pronounce Taoiseach" the Gaelic
word for prime minister.
