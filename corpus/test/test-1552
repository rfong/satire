French worm turns on Chinese silk dragon
French industrialists and scientists, worried by China's virtual
monopoly over raw silk supplies, are out to revive French and European
silk production, which thrived in the last century but has since fallen
into decline.
In Lyon, the silk capital of Europe, a project called "Eurochrysalide"
is being hatched with a view to making the local industry 75 percent
self-sufficient in raw silk output, said Jean-Francois Perrin chairman
of Perrin textiles group.
At president China's annual production of 32,000 tonnes of silk make it
by far the world's biggest producer, well ahead of India or Brazil.
Between 80 and 90 percent of raw silk on the market comes from China,
Perrin said.
French production, which was 25,000 tonnes in 1850, has shrunk to a
mere 600 tonnes, forcing textile manufacturers to turn to the Far East,
first to Japan then to China.
"This situation is not healthy. It is time to diversify our sources of
supply," said Perrin who is co-sponsoring Eurochrysalide.
A total of 50 million francs (9.26 million dollars) are earmarked for
the Eurochrysalide project over the next six years, including 12
million francs (2.23 million dollars) donated by the European Union.
The Rhone-Alpes region, of which Lyon is the capital, has provided a
further six million francs (1.12 million dollars). The remainder of the
cash will be put up by the silk industry.
The project is expected to move into top gear next year with the
building of a silkworm breeding farm in the Ardeche region of southern
France and of several research laboratories. The idea is to make the
region the hub of silk breeding in western Europe.
Genetic scientists from the National Institute of Agronomy Research
(INRA) and the National Silk-Breeding Unit (UNS) from Lyons are being
detached to Eurochrysalide to create on hybrid species of silk worms
able to compete with those in Asia.
"Using 60 species of silkworm, we are developing high-performing
hybrids resistent to disease and which produce threads of better
quality than the Chinese ones," said UNS expert Gerard Chavenacy.
The European project also seeks to take advantage of economic changes
in China, said Ronald Currie secretary-general the International Silk
Association in Lyon.
"History shows that countries which become industrialised tend to
abandon silkworm breeding. It was the case in Europe and more recently
in Japan. The same thing will probably happen in China, hence the need
to create new sources of supply," Currie said.
At the same time domestic demand for silk in China is expanding
rapidly, parallel with the rise in the standard of living of its
population. The French say this could eventually result in a price
explosion or shortages on the world market.
However the prospect of Europe becoming a major competitor of China in
the silk trade is still remote, notably because of the low cost of
labour in Asia.
"It is an illusion to think we can replace China. At the best Europe
can be complementary," said Currie.
