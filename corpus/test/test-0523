Ranatunga retained as captain for Pakistan tour 
Veteran all-rounder Arjuna Ranatunga has been retained as captain for
Sri Lanka's three-test tour of Pakistan in August, it was announced
here Monday.
Ranatunga's re-appointment as captain was expected, especially after
his role in leading Sri Lanka to its first overseas win over New
Zealand earlier this year.
In addition to three tests, Sri Lanka will play three one-day
internationals during the tour of Pakistan from August 26 to October 5.
A 25-member pool that has commenced training for the Pakistan tour also
includes Ranatunga's elder brother, Dhammika and younger brother,
Sanjeeva. The team for the Pakistan tour will be picked from the pool.
Ranatunga, 31, led Sri Lanka's to its first test victory overseas by
beating New Zealand 1-0 in the three test series in March. It was the
first time the islanders had taken a tie away from home since entering
the test arena in 1982.
Ranatunga, a middle-order left-hand batsman, is the only survivor of
the team that played England in Sri Lanka's inaugural test match in
1982.
