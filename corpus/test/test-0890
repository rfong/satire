Australian Dollar Dips on Weak Japanese Yen 
The negative impact of a weak Japanese yen drove the Australian dollar
more than half a U.S. cent lower Thursday.
At the close in Sydney Thursday, the local currency was buying 61.53
U.S. cents from Wednesday's close of 62.09 U.S. cents.
"It is reacting quite a lot to Asian weakness and weakness in the
Japanese yen," a dealer said.
The U.S. dollar was trading at 140.16 Japanese yen, from 139.57 yen
Wednesday.
The main focus for the Australian dollar continued to be Asia, the
dealer said.
Overnight the Australian unit followed the yen down after Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto indicated that any tax cuts would not
be forthcoming this year.
The expected tax package had been seen as a major component of Japan's
recovery from recession.
At the close, the Australian dollar was trading at 86.18 Japanese yen
from 86.15 yen and 1.1207 German marks from 1.1281 marks.
