US regulatory agency says Sumitomo is coooperating, denies complaint
The US regulatory agency investigating the copper market on Wednesday
denied reports it had found the Japanese trading firm Sumitomo
uncooperative and was weighing a complaint against it.
"That's totally wrong," R. David Gary, spokesman for the Commodities
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), said when questioned about a London
newspaper report suggesting that Sumitomo could be the target of a
formal complaint.
"We're very pleased with the degree of cooperation we're receiving from
foreign governments, specifically the SIB (the Securities and
Investment Board) in the United Kingdom and the regulatory agencies in
Japan, and Sumitomo."
London's Evening Standard newspaper reported Tuesday that British and
US regulators were becoming increasingly frustrated with a lack of
cooperation from Sumitomo.
Fraud and financial investigators are seeking to uncover the
circumstances that enabled Sumitomo's top copper trader, Yasuo
Hamanaka, to run up losses of at least 1.8 billion dollars over 10
years on irregular copper deals on the New York and London markets.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), along with SIB and the CFTC, sent
teams to Tokyo last week to investigate the affair.
According to the Standard, the CFTC was prepared to issue a formal
complaint against Sumitomo if the company continued to drag its feet in
the probe.
In addition to the denial from the CFTC, Sumitomo has likewise insisted
that it is "cooperating fully with regulators' investigations and ...
will continue to do so."
