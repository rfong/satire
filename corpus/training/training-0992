Shanghai B-Share Market Down at Friday Close 
Shanghai B-share market shaded 0.50 or 0.72 percent to close at 68.68
on Friday.
Turnover sharply retracted to 19.42 million U.S. dollars, which was
51.11 million or 72.47 percent less than Thursday's total, according to
Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory
company.
Shanghai B-share market failed to trim its losses in the afternoon
trading amid the emerging profit taking, while the market still lacked
follow-through buying, which led the market incapable of firming its
foothold on the plus side.
Gainers lagged behind losers by 11 to 32 with 12 unchanged.
Homeway analysts predict the B-share market will post its corrective
stage next week, as investors are likely to set a respite in the near
term.
