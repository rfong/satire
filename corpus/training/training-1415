Kwasniewski sworn in, calls for dialogue with opposition, church 
Former communist Aleksandr Kwasniewski was sworn in Saturday as
Poland's new president, succeeding Lech Walesa, and immediately issued
a call for dialogue with Walesa's supporters and the Catholic Church.
Shortly after taking oath before the Polish parliament, Kwasniewski
launched an appeal for dialogue and cooperation with the opposition.
"Less emotion, more reason, fewer divisions, more understanding," he
said.
He also pledged to do his utmost to integrate Poland into Europe.
"I am ready to personally take on the responsibility of guiding Poland
towards European structures. This is a big task for me, to ensure that
Poland becomes part of a world which was out of its reach until just
recently."
Kwasniewski narrowly defeated the erstwhile trade union leader after a
bitter battle for the presidency in elections on November 19.
Walesa and several opposition deputies chose to boycott the swearing-in
ceremony, as did Poland's primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp and other
Catholic dignitaries.
The 41 year-old president said he was open to cooperation and dialogue
with the Catholic Church, which made no secret of its hostility during
the electoral campaign.
"We must engage in a serious conversation on Poland and the challenges
before us. I hope that such a dialogue will be possible, without
emotion," he said.
"The way of confrontation and unbridled emotions will not lead us
anywhere. I am opposed", Kwasniewski added.
Meanwhile, outside the parliament building around 1,500 anti-communist
demonstrators gathered to protest against the investiture, shouting
slogans and throwing firecrackers.
Supporters of the reformed communist, whose Democratic Left Alliance
(SLD) now holds a monopoly on power, also rallied outside the building.
