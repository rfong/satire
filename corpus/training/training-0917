Earthquake hits Tbilisi, no casualties 
An earthquake measuring 7.0 on the richter scale rocked Georgia's
capital Tbilisi late Thursday but caused no casualties, the Georgian
interior ministry said.
The quake, which hit at 10:45 pm local time (1745 GMT), destroyed
several buildings in Tbilisi.
Its epicenter was near the capital, the head of the Georgian Seismology
Institute, Tamaz Chelidze, told AFP.
Tbilisi has already been rocked by two minor earthquakes over the past
two weeks.
