False move lets in for Li for gold
Li Xiaoshuang of China, the reigning world champion, won the Olympic
individual gymnastics title here Wednesday thanks to just one false
move from Russia's Alexei Nemov.
Li, 22, totalled with 58.423, just edging the younger Russian by 0.058
of a point.
Vitaly Scherbo from Belarus, the six-time Olympic champion four years
ago, took the bronze with 58.197.
Li and Nemev, 20, who led Russia to the team title two days ago, were
in tight competition throughout the event with the Russian gaining a
narrow edge of 0.038 points going into the final round.
The draw dictated that the two performed their final routines at the
same time, though on different apparatuses.
In the end it was came down to just one small slip on their last
exercise. While Li stuck solidly on his dismount off the high bar,
getting 9.787, Nemov omitted one crucial twist in his floor routine,
scoring 9.700.
Nemov left out the twist on his middle pass of the routine and the
judges nailed him down for it.
"I didn't do my main diagonal routine with the fullest degee of
difficulty," he said. "I just made a small mistake and couldn't get
that extra twist in there."
As a result Nemov's routine was scored not from a possible perfect 10.0
but from 9.9 as the judges noted the reduced difficulty.
"Of course, I didn't do it on purpose. It just happened," said the
Russian. "I guess I wasn't meant to be the champion tonight. But I'm
not disappointed with the silver."
Asked if his mishap angered Russia's autocratic coach Leonid Arkaev,
Nemov said: "He just came over and congratulated me."
Scherbo took a swipe at the judges who have been accused of bias and
notably of being over-generous to the host nation.
"I don't want to talk about the judges with the finals on each
apparatus coming up, but after that you'll hear everything about these
judges. They were real bad today," said the bronze medallist.
"I was not upset how they judged me but how they scored my main
competitors," he said. "I don't know if I would have won because Alexei
was better but my performance was very close to him."
Russia's Alexei Voropaev, another strong contender for the overall
title and in third position after three rotations, had a disaster on
the pommel horse, getting only 8.400 and bombing his hopes.
