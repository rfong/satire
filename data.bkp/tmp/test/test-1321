England/NNP coach/NN vows/VBZ to/TO go/VB for/IN high-speed/JJ win/NN against/IN Sweden/NNP Sven-Goran/NNP Eriksson/NNP has/VBZ vowed/VBD England/NNP will/MD play/VB for/IN a/DT win/NN in/IN their/PRP$ World/NNP Cup/NNP opener/NN against/IN Sweden/NNP on/IN Sunday/NNP and/CC will/MD not/RB adapt/VB their/PRP$ fast-paced/JJ style/NN to/TO suit/NN what/WP are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO be/VB hot/JJ conditions/NNS in/IN Saitama/NNP ./.

The/DT first/JJ matches/NN in/IN World/NNP Cup/NNP groups/NNS are/VBP often/RB cagey/JJ affairs/NNS with/IN many/JJ sides/NNS more/RBR anxious/JJ to/TO avoid/VB defeat/NN than/IN secure/VB the/DT three/CD points/NNS but/CC the/DT England/NNP coach/NN said/VBD he/PRP would/MD be/VB disappointed/VBN with/IN any/DT of/IN his/PRP$ players/NNS if/IN they/PRP adopted/VBD that/DT attitude/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP really/RB hope/VBP we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB players/NNS in/IN the/DT group/NN saying/VBG it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ not/RB to/TO lose/VB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD after/IN announcing/VBG that/IN inspirational/JJ captain/NN David/NNP Beckham/NNP would/MD be/VB fit/VBN for/IN the/DT crucial/JJ clash/NN with/IN the/DT Swedes/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PRP can/MD agree/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ not/RB to/TO lose/VB but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ even/RB more/RBR important/JJ to/TO win/VB ,/, ''/'' Eriksson/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` We/PRP are/VBP not/RB starting/VBG the/DT game/NN Sunday/NNP trying/VBG to/TO make/VB a/DT draw/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD try/VB to/TO win/VB the/DT game/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ Sweden/NNP will/MD do/VB the/DT same/JJ thing/NN because/IN we/PRP are/VBP all/RB aware/JJ that/IN we/PRP have/VBP Argentina/NNP in/IN our/PRP$ group/NN and/CC ,/, if/IN I/PRP agree/VBP or/CC not/RB does/VBZ not/RB matter/VB ,/, they/PRP are/VBP the/DT favorites/NNS if/IN you/PRP talk/VBP to/TO football/NN experts/NNS around/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

``/`` So/RB of/IN course/NN if/IN you/PRP can/MD have/VB three/CD points/NNS in/IN the/DT first/JJ game/NN it/PRP will/MD be/VB very/RB good/JJ ./. ''/''

Eriksson/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN encouraged/VBN to/TO find/VB the/DT climatic/JJ conditions/NNS in/IN Japan/NNP easier/JJR than/IN he/PRP had/VBD been/VBN anticipating/VBG with/IN temperatures/NNS rising/VBG to/TO around/RB 27/CD degrees/NNS Celsius/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 81/CD degrees/NNS Fahrenheit/JJ -RRB-/-RRB- at/IN the/DT hottest/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN and/CC considerably/RB lower/JJR by/IN the/DT early/JJ evening/NN ,/, when/WRB Sunday/NNP 's/POS game/NN will/MD be/VB played/VBN ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ hotter/JJ than/IN England/NNP but/CC so/RB far/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB been/VBN as/RB hot/JJ as/IN I/PRP expected/VBD ,/, ''/'' Eriksson/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` So/CC I/PRP expect/VBP that/IN the/DT game/NN will/MD be/VB played/VBN at/IN a/DT high/JJ pace/NN ./.

``/`` At/IN least/JJS in/IN the/DT beginning/NN we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO try/VB to/TO play/VB as/IN we/PRP do/VBP normally/RB ./. ''/''

The/DT Swede/NN has/VBZ faced/VBN criticism/NN in/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS that/IN his/PRP$ England/NNP lineups/NNS have/VBP started/VBN to/TO rely/VB too/RB heavily/RB on/IN long/JJ balls/NNS hit/VBN in/IN behind/IN defenders/NNS for/IN forwards/JJ and/CC wide/JJ midfield/JJ players/NNS to/TO chase/NN ,/, an/DT approach/NN that/WDT is/VBZ harder/JJR to/TO sustain/VB when/WRB it/PRP gets/VBZ hot/JJ and/CC steamy/JJ ./.

Eriksson/NN promised/VBN that/IN Sweden/NNP and/CC the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN would/MD see/VB a/DT radically/RB different/JJ England/NNP from/IN the/DT sides/NNS which/WDT failed/VBD to/TO impress/VB in/IN warm-up/NN draws/VBZ against/IN South/NNP Korea/NNP last/JJ week/NN and/CC Cameroon/NNP on/IN Sunday/NNP ./.

He/PRP said/VBD the/DT friendlies/NNS against/IN two/CD sides/NNS with/IN radically/RB different/JJ styles/NNS had/VBD been/VBN a/DT worthwhile/JJ exercise/NN ,/, but/CC warned/VBD against/IN reading/VBG too/RB much/RB into/IN them/PRP ./.

``/`` Especially/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP take/VBP the/DT last/JJ game/NN against/IN Cameroon/NNP ,/, we/PRP had/VBD four/CD ,/, five/CD or/CC six/CD players/NNS who/WP did/VBD their/PRP$ job/NN and/CC nothing/NN more/RBR ./.

They/PRP already/RB knew/VBD they/PRP 'll/MD play/VB against/IN Sweden/NNP ,/, so/IN why/WRB should/MD they/PRP do/VBP more/JJR than/IN just/RB their/PRP$ job/NN ./.

``/`` Those/DT players/NNS will/MD play/VB much/RB better/RBR on/IN Sunday/NNP when/WRB the/DT World/NNP Cup/NNP starts/VBZ ./.

Of/IN course/NN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO play/VB better/RBR and/CC we/PRP will/MD play/VB better/RBR ./. ''/''

Eriksson/NNP admitted/VBD Sunday/NNP 's/POS match/NN was/VBD likely/JJ to/TO be/VB an/DT emotional/JJ affair/NN but/CC not/RB because/IN he/PRP was/VBD coming/VBG up/RP against/IN his/PRP$ native/JJ country/NN ./.

``/`` Whichever/NNP team/VB we/PRP meet/VB in/IN the/DT World/NNP Cup/NNP it/PRP will/MD be/VB emotional/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP 'll/MD feel/VB anything/NN just/RB because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ Sweden/NNP because/IN you/PRP are/VBP very/RB focussed/JJ on/IN the/DT game/NN ./.

``/`` When/WRB you/PRP have/VBP three/CD games/NNS in/IN the/DT group/NN all/DT three/CD games/NNS are/VBP like/IN a/DT final/JJ to/TO you/PRP ./. ''/''
