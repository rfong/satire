Middlesbrough's money talks for Juventus 
Juventus chief Luciano Moggi admitted on Thursday that his club's
decision to sell Fabrizio Ravanelli to English club Middlesbrough was
based solely on the size of their seven million pound offer.
Ravanelli, one of the best-known strikers in Italian football, signed
for the Premiership club after a meeting with Middlesbrough manager
Bryan Robson at a hotel near Malpensa airport, outside Milan.
Moggi, who is director general of the European champions, said: "To an
offer like the one we got for Ravanelli, you just can't say 'no'."
Team coach Marcello Lippi quickly defended his club's decision to sell.
The move is unlikely to go down well with Juventus fans, particularly
in the wake of having just lost skipper Gianluca Vialli to Chelsea.
"I was aware of the negotiations for Ravanelli," Lippi said. "The
decision to sell him was taken by Juventus management, with my
agreement.
"Over the last three years, Juventus' policy has always been the same
-- to look ahead and to improve the squad with the right players.
"In the first year, Andreas Moller, Dino Baggio and Julio Cesar left;
in the second, Jurgen Kohler and Roberto Baggio went. This year it is
Fabrizio Ravanelli and Gianluca Vialli.
"But there are new players arriving, so let's not talk about sacrifice.
Let's call it change."
Juventus have recently signed Lazio forward Alen Boksic and Bordeaux
midfielder Zinedine Zidane, along with two members of Italy's Under-21
European championship winning squad -- Nicola Amoruso and Christian
Vieri.
