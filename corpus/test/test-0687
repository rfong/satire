As James Wyatt and Gerard Plunkett told it, their lives changed forever
one night nearly nine years ago, when a man shot and seriously wounded
them after a traffic dispute.
He turned out to be an off-duty New York state correction officer.
As the officer, Kenneth Robinson, told it, his life was in danger when
he fired at Wyatt and Plunkett, who were hurling punches and racial
slurs at him. Wyatt and Plunkett are white, and Robinson is black.
After years of courtroom battles that may not be over yet, the state
has been held responsible for Robinson's actions, even though he was
off duty, and last week a judge ordered it to pay more than $6 million
to the men he shot.
The judge, Albert Blinder of the Court of Claims in Manhattan, said
Wyatt should get just over $4 million and Plunkett slightly more than
$2 million.
It is virtually certain that the state will consider appealing the
ruling. A spokesman for Attorney General Dennis Vacco, in office less
than three weeks, said last week that he has not had time to study the
case.
The case arises from a seemingly minor and common kind of traffic
confrontation. On March 21, 1986, Wyatt, Plunkett and Plunkett's wife
had dinner together and made plans to go to a basketball game.
Wyatt, who lived in the Inwood section of Manhattan, and the Plunketts,
who lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, took the same route
home in their separate cars.
The accounts of what happened next vary, depending on who is telling
the story.
Wyatt testified that he saw a car go through a red light in the Bronx.
Pulling alongside the car moments later, Wyatt said, he told the driver
to be more careful. The other driver was Robinson, then employed at the
Taconic Correctional Facility in Westchester County.
The drivers got out of their cars, and after a confrontation --
Robinson said he was attacked -- the officer shot Wyatt.
Moments later, Plunkett drove up, saw what was happening and got out of
his car to confront Robinson, who shot him also. Robinson has
maintained that he fired only in self-defense and after showing his
correction officer's badge and firing warning shots.
Years ago, a Bronx grand jury declined to indict Robinson. Wyatt and
Plunkett then sued the state, contending that the Department of
Correctional Services should never have hired Robinson, and that its
screening and training of applicants was inadequate.
To illustrate their point, they noted that the department had failed to
take action against Robinson in an incident in 1984, when he shot and
killed a dog in the Bronx.
The dog's owner testified that he had notified the state, to no avail.
Robinson testified he was on crutches at the time and shot the dog
because he thought it was going to attack him.
The plaintiffs' suit was dismissed by the Court of Claims in 1990, but
the Appellate Division reinstated it a year later, holding that the
state was liable. The case went to the Court of Claims again for the
purpose of awarding damages.
When Wyatt was shot, he was 43 years old and worked as a specialist
clerk on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
In the ruling this week, Blinder said that Wyatt's recovery had been an
ordeal that included abdominal surgery, partial disability of his right
hip and leg and constant pain that caused him to make repeated mistakes
and has hampered his career.
``What he lost was the opportunity for dramatic advancement,'' the
judge wrote.
Plunkett, 35, was a stockbroker at the time he was shot in the left
hip. The judge wrote that Plunkett spent agonizing weeks in the
hospital and was left with a shortened leg that has curtailed his
previously athletic way of life.
Robinson is being sued separately in state Supreme Court, according to
the plaintiffs' lawyers, Richard Dienst and Barry Washor for Wyatt and
Lawrence Epstein for Plunkett.
Dienst said he understood that Robinson was still working for the
correction agency. Robinson could not be reached for comment, nor could
officials who could confirm his employment.
