Congress Debates Coolness Of Rush
Continuing its long-running debate on the subject Monday, members of
Congress argued the merits of Canadian power trio Rush. "'The philosopher
and the plowman, each must play his part'?"  asked House Majority Leader
Dick Armey (R-TX). "C'mon. Neil Peart must be the most pretentious lyricist
in arena-rock history. Gentlemen, forget these bloated, overrated '70s
dinosaurs." Countered longtime Rush loyalist Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR):
"Keep talking, man, the tunes say it all: 'Passage To Bangkok'? 'By-Tor And
The Snow Dog'? That part in 'Red Barchetta' where [Rush bassist/vocalist]
Geddy [Lee] sings about the gleaming alloy aircar shooting toward him two
lanes wide?  Look me in the eye and tell me that doesn't rock,
motherfucker!" The deliberations are expected to continue throughout the
week.
