People's Daily Lashes Out Lee Tung-hui's Remark
The reunification of China is an interior issue, the article says.
Taiwan has been part of Chinese territory for ages and has never been a
sovereign country. This basic fact can not be changed by anyone, it
says, and the reunification of the country could be peaceful under the
One China principle.
Under the principle, the position and level of Taiwan and the Mainland
in negotiations are equal, and the form, name and place of negotiation
can be flexible. Lee vainly hoped to deny the One China principle with
his "two-states" remark, but alienated himself from the Chinese nation
and from everything possible in peaceful negotiations.
The article warns Lee that anyone attempting to negate the One China
principle to divide the country will be a sinner in the eyes of the
Chinese people who will not offer such a person any position or conduct
any dialogue with him at any level.
Lee was up to his old tricks in making the "two-states" remark, but he
has forgotten two essential facts: that the Chinese people will make
every effort to safeguard the integrity and sovereignty of the country,
and that foreign countries have their own strategic interests that
precede all decision making.
The Chinese people as a whole will not allow Lee to gamble with the
interests of Taiwan compatriots and anyone who tries to get foreign
backing for his dirty tricks will come to a bad end, the article says.
The article finally advises Lee to take back his remark, return to the
One China position, and do what any Chinese honestly would do for the
country's reunification.
