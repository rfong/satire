Noah Out in First Round, Bruguera Struggles Through 
Charismatic French tennis star Yannick Noah was knocked out of the
first round of the dlrs 560,000 Swiss Open tennis tournament Tuesday -
his first appearance in ATP competition for four years.
The half-French, half Cameroon, 1983 French Open champion decided to
return to the tennis circuit after bowing out of full-time play in 1991
to concentrate on a career as a pop singer.
But he never entirely left the tennis scene, leading his country to
Davis Cup victory in 1991.
However his appearance on the clay courts at Gstaad was brief. He was
defeated by compatriot Cedric Pioline in 3-6, 6-7 (7-9), despite a set
point in the tie-break.
In other play Tuesday three time Swiss Open champion and third seed
Sergei Bruguera of Spain struggled to win his second round place,
losing the second set to American opponent Francisco Montana and
starting the third a break behind.
He finally retrieved the match 6-3, 1-6, 6-2.
And fourth seed, Switzerland's Marc Rosset lost his first set to Karel
Novacek, of the Czech Republic before stamping his mark on the game
2-6, 6-3, 6-4. cfh)
