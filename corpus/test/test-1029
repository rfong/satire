Chirac: Talks between Sino-French Leaders Deepen Understanding 
French President Jacques Chirac said that the free and in-depth talks
between him and visiting Chinese president have helped deepen mutual
understanding.
Chirac made the remarks while meeting with the press together with
Jiang after they held talks here Monday morning.
"China is a big country of Asia and France is a big country of Europe
and the integration of Europe is developing continuously," said Chirac.
"Asia and Europe are two important poles of the world and they have
played an important role in establishing a multipolar world," said
Chirac, adding that cooperation between the two continents and two
countries should thus be strengthened.
According to the French president, exchanges and cooperation between
French and Chinese leaders should be regular, especially in the
political field.
"Leaders of the two countries have attached great importance to
eliminating disputes through dialogues, and that explains why I invited
Jiang to my private residence and held such lengthy talks, " Chirac
said.
"Both President Jiang and I agree that through dialogues and exchanges,
we have achieved mutual understanding," he added.
