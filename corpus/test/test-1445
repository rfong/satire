Special Coin Features Rare Golden Monkey 
A special commemorative coin will be issued by the People's Bank of
China as of November 16 to publicize the country's efforts in
protecting the endangered golden monkey.
According to the bank, a total of six million coins will be issued to
the public, the second of its kind since six million coins were
released featuring the giant panda on June 15, 1993.
The coin, made of copper alloy, is 32 mm in diameter and valued at five
yuan (about 60 US cents). It is legal tender.
This is part of the country's drive to further enhance and publicize
its protection of animals which are on the verge of extinction.
The golden monkey is on the state's top protection list, next only to
the giant panda.
