Radio Uganda Staff Suspended For Corruption 
A number of Radio Uganda staff members have been suspended from office
for corruption, Radio Uganda sources told Xinhua here today.
According to the sources, the Ugandan Ministry of Information recently
ordered the work suspension of all junior staff who read personal
announcements in the commercial section of Radio Uganda.
The reason for the suspension is the increasing corruption in the
department, where losses of revenue have reached an alarming level, the
sources said.
The suspended staff members were said to have embezzled more than half
of the public earnings.
With the suspension taking effect, Radio Uganda acting chief commercial
manager, Paul Olungi, has to take over the work to read the
announcements himself.
The situation will return to nalmal within a month, the sources said.
Not long ago, the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Information,
Nathan Odoi, told the Public Accounts Committee that staff in Radio
Uganda and Uganda Television were corrupt and the problem must be
redressed.
