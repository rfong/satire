Oklahoma blast toll climbs to 136 
The death toll from the Oklahoma City blast climbed to 136 early Monday
as rescue workers searched for survivors in the rubble of the federal
building destroyed almost two weeks ago.
Forty-nine people were still missing, a spokesman for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told AFP in a telephone interview.
Six more people were confirmed dead, bringing the official toll to 136,
he said.
Search operations were suspended for roughly three hours overnight
because of thunderstorms, the FEMA spokesman said, but work was ongoing
early Monday under overcast skies.
Late Sunday, Governor Frank Keating said the state soon may use heavy
machinery to clear the site of the April 19 carbomb blast as hope dims
for finding survivors.
"The decision's been made to use machinery," the governor said after
meeting officials from rescue and fire services. "It could be in the
next day or so."
"You reach a point where you don't jeopardize human beings in order to
extract the dead," he said, adding: "The building is in a lot worse
shape than we thought it was."
Risks of a cave-in have seriously slowed down the search in the part of
the building where a day nursery and social security offices were
located.
Rescuers fear a large number of victims may be buried there.
