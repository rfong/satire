Australian Stocks Close Firmer As Big Caps Bounce 
Strong buying interest in large capitalization stocks inspired by the
success of News Corp's 1.76- billion-U.S.-dollar share offer in Fox
Entertainment in the U.S. helped the Australian share market close
firmer Wednesday.
The all ordinaries index climbed just under 1.5 percent, or 38.3 points
to close at its peak for the day of 2,720.7.
The rise was strongest in non-resource stocks with the all industrials
index up 77.0 points to 4,764.2 while the all resources index added 5.1
points to 1,075.2.
Volume was strong with national turnover a healthy 348.5 million shares
traded worth 1.129 billion Australian dollars (711.23 million U.S.
dollars) with 624 shares rising, 475 falling and 397 steady.
News Corp's ordinary shares jumped 4.7 percent, or 51 cents, to 11.30
Australian dollars, while its preferred shares climbed 42 to 10.08
Australian dollars.
Henderson Charlton Jones dealer Michael Blake said News Corp was firmer
largely due to positive news about the Fox Entertainment Group Inc
float in the United States.
He said rises among other key industrials such as Lend Lease and
Brambles were also keeping the market firm.
The local bourse drew little direction from the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in New York which closed down 33.98 points at 8,863.98
overnight.
Westpac rose 31 cents after it delivered a 1.5-percent drop in net
profit after an abnormal loss in line with expectations.
The other banking majors' strength also contributed to a 1.93-percent
jump in the banking sub index to 5,976.0 points.
National Australia rose 49 cents, Commonwealth rose 46.9 and ANZ gained
14 cents on turnover of 7.1 million shares.
The only major industrial to buck the positive trend was Telstra, which
drifted four cents on strong volume of 11.82 million shares.
Elsewhere in the industrial sector, Lend Lease stacked on 58.5 cents
and Brambles Industries soared 69.
Resource majors were generally much softer performers.
BHP gained a modest two cents, while Rio Tinto added 24 after a weak
start while fellow diversified miner WMC lost three cents.
The gold index firmed 14.8 points to 1,180.8 as bullion gained 1.20
U.S. dollars to 293.10 per ounce in Sydney trading.
