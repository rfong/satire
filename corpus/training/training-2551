Summit on Bosnia Starts in Rome 
The presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia and Western mediators
began an emergency summit here this afternoon to review the Dayton
peace accord.
The summit was opened by Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli of Italy, the
current holder of the rotating European Union presidency.
"There are bumps in the road we've encountered. We hope to smooth them
out," U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters before the
start of the summit.
The agenda during the two-day summit would include the breakdown in
relations between Bosnian Serbs and NATO, the exchange of prisoners and
the growing fractures in Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation, according to
U.S. officials.
Besides Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, President Franjo Tudjman
of Croatia, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Holbrooke, General
George Joulwan, NATO's Supreme Commander Allied Powers Europe, and NATO
Bosnian commander Admiral Leighton Smith also sat around the conference
table together with officials of the Contact Group.
