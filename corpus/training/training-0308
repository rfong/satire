Mongolian Parliamentary Elections Begin 
More than 1.2 million registered Mongolian voters began streaming to
some 1,600 polling stations across the country Sunday morning to cast
their ballots in the country's third parliamentary elections.
A total of 579 candidates representing 13 political parties and three
blocs, as 24 well 24 independents, are contesting 76 seats in the State
Great Khural, the parliament.
In rural areas, some herdsmen have to travel up to 100 kilometers to
reach the nearest station before the poll ends at 10 p.m. (1400 GMT).
The polling stations were opened at 7 a.m. (2300 GMT Saturday).
Preliminary results are expected to be released Monday afternoon and
the official results will be announced some 10 days later.
The latest opinion poll has shown that the opposition Mongolian
People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) is expected to win 51 percent of
the vote, far ahead of the ruling coalition's major partners -- the
Mongolian National Democratic Party and the Mongolian Social Democratic
Party.
The MPRP, the country's largest opposition, won 25 seats in last
parliamentary elections four years ago, compared with a 50- seat
majority held by the ruling four-party coalition.
