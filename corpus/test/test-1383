Clashes Break Out In Chechnya, Peace Talks Rejected 
Russia's top military official said Monday that no peace can come from
negotiations with Chechen rebels, declaring that Moscow will only
settle for their surrender.
Coming a day after a tentative truce expired, the comments by Defense
Minister Pavel Grachev in Moscow further dimmed any hopes that the war
he once said could be settled in two hours would end any time soon.
Sporadic shelling and small-arms fire erupted in the Chechen capital
Grozny, and Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev would ``last for another
50 years.''
Grachev, visiting an armor testing range outside Moscow, said Chechen
military commanders ``are willing to talk about a cease-fire. But our
talks with them are short -- no cease-fire whatsoever, just an
ultimatum about surrendering the weapons.''
The warring sides in the breakaway republic reported scattered clashes
but no large-scale military activities Monday. Earlier, they had
accused each other of breaching the shaky cease-fire, which began last
Wednesday.
Boris Agapov, vice president of neighboring Ingushetia and a mediator
in past peace talks, said he had phone conversations with both sides
but was not immediately able to arrange a new round of negotiations.
The Russian military command in Chechnya did not sound like it was
ready to compromise over the 10-week-old war. It appealed to Chechen
civilians, urging them to negotiate with federal forces and expel rebel
fighters from their settlements.
It promised to spare villages and towns that would offer no resistance
but reiterated that it plans to take ``adequate measures'' after
exhausting all possibilities to negotiate.
Dudayev, meanwhile, repeated his call for negotiations with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, saying he never expected talks at the military
level to succeed.
``Commanders are never able to solve problems,'' he told the Estonian
newspaper Postimees, the Interfax news agency reported.
Dudayev also denied reports his son Avlur was killed, saying he was
only wounded and that his entire family now lives in the mountains. But
Russian officials said Dudayev's elder brother Bekmurza was detained
last Thursday in Grozny, the Chechen capital, and is now being held in
Moscow.
As the cease-fire ran out, heavy explosions could be heard south of the
shattered capital. Russian Interior Ministry troops with several
armored vehicles had dug in overnight near the village of Samashky,
west of Grozny.
Some firefights occurred in the area outside Grozny, according to
Chechen fighters interviewed on a stretch of empty road near the
deserted village of Alkhan-Yurt.
As they spoke, an artillery round smacked into the dense woods behind
them, startling a group of women refugees. Like a handful of others,
they went to Grozny to see their apartments, but were returning
empty-handed.
``They're firing at everything -- it was too dangerous to go back,''
said one refugee, 45-year-old Tamara.
Lyoma Abzuyev, 48, and his 41-year-old wife Bela risked a brief trip to
Grozny's Chernorechye district, where pro-Dudayev fighters still hold
out, to collect the last of their belongings.
In a street scarred by shell and rocket attacks, they suddenly burst
out laughing. After the nail-biting journey, they realized they had
forgotten their keys.
As Lyoma broke the door down, they found their belongings lying strewn
across the furniture in the small, musty flat.
``There's no end in sight for the war. They want us to hand in our guns
and live as prisoners,'' said Lyoma. His four brothers are missing and
Bela's brother was killed in a bomb attack.
``We had to bury what we could -- arms, legs, whatever was left of
them,'' she said with angry sobs.
A group of Chechen fighters in Chernorechye breakfasted around an open
fire, unperturbed by the short, hollow thud of outgoing mortar fire and
occasional automatic rounds.
In Moscow, a parliamentary committee formed earlier this year held its
first open hearings on the Chechen conflict. It listened to testimony
from an odd assembly of noted hard-liners and liberals, who -- for
varying reasons -- attacked Yeltsin and his government.
The former speaker of Chechnya's parliament predicted that the war
would bring an end to Russian democracy.
``As the process of the collapse of Communism began in (the Soviet war
in) Afghanistan, so is the funeral of Russian democracy going on in
Chechnya,'' Yusuf Soslanbekov said.
