Edwards said: "The secret of my records? Keeping the speed during the
run-ups and take-offs.
"To achieve an 18m jump on the first try was a surprise, of course. It
helped me to relax. Somebody told me this was the Beamon jump at sea
level."
Wellman, surprisingly, said: "I still thought that I could beat
Jonathan all the way to the last round. Still, I'm happy."
Romain added: "I had no problems focusing after Edwards' world records
-- it just gave me more energy."
