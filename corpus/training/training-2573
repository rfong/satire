Nepal, Britain to Promote Economic Ties 
Nepali Prime Minister G.P. Koirala and visiting British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook stressed here Friday the need to further
consolidate the existing friendly relations between Nepal and Britain
by expanding trade and investment.
During his meeting with Cook, Koirala called for more trade and
investment from Britain to help with Nepal's development and strengthen
the existing friendly and cordial bilateral relations between the two
kingdoms.
"The Nepali government has taken liberal economic policies and
investment friendly decisions for foreign investors," said Koirala. "If
there is any lacuna, the government is ready to take another look at
those rules and provisions," he added.
The prime minister expressed gratitude to the British government for
the development assistance extended to Nepal and hoped the support
would continue.
Cook agreed that the good relations between Nepal and Britain should be
expanded at the economic dimension through trade and investment.
He said Britain is commited to developing the trade and commercial
links with Nepal, adding that Britain wishes to see Nepal 's own
business and commerce thrive and develop so that trade will transcend
aid as the basis for Nepal's development.
According to reports, Britain is one of the largest bilateral donors to
Nepal, and its annual aid to the country totals 19 million U.S.
dollars.
On the same day, Cook held talks with Nepali Foreign Minister Chakra
Bastola and discussed ways to expand economic cooperation, promote
bilateral trade and encourage more British investment in Nepal.
The develop programs they discussed included construction of roads,
bridges and other projects. The two foreign ministers also discussed
some issues of mutual concern.
Cook, who arrived here Thursday for a two-day official visit, is the
first-ever British foreign secretary to visit Nepal after the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
