Berlusconi pledges democracy, admits to "concerns" over cabinet by
Jean-Louis de la Vaissiere
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi pledged Monday that his administration
would adhere to Italy's democratic structures, and admitted to
"legitimate concerns" over the presence of neo-fascists in the cabinet.
Presenting his government program in a speech to the Senate, the new
premier acknowledged what he called "legitimate concerns," notably
voiced abroad, over having five members of the neo-fascist National
Alliance in his government.
But he warned opposition parliamentarians against voting his team out
of office.
"This government is without a shadow of a doubt rooted within the
constitutional charter" which has defined Italy's democratic structures
since 1948, he said.
The three-party right-wing coalition which won March general elections
and from which the cabinet has been drawn had "a common and explicit
perspective in favour of civil liberties and the unity of the country."
Berlusconi hit out at criticism of his adminstration, citing the leader
of the ex-communist Party of the Democratic Left, Achille Occhetto.
"To define the government as a government which humiliates Italy is not
a good way to start. It is a gratuitous insult to the honour of the
country," he said.
The media magnate turned politican stressed that "the presence of the
National Alliance in the government can not be a pretext to withhold
legitimacy" from the new administration.
On the economy, Berlusconi reiterated campaign pledges to make job
creation one of his top goals said he wanted to speed up privatization
of state-owned firms.
On foreign policy he said Italy would remain comitted to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and to economic cooperation within the
European Union.
He warned opposition parliamentarians against the temptation "to
prevent the country from being governed" and thereby set in motion "a
vicious circle of non-communication."
Berlusconi, who announced his government last week, must win backing
for his government from both chambers of parliament.
The Senate, where he lacks a majority, is due to hold its vote of
confidence Wednesday. Berlusconi's coalition has an absolute majority
in the lower chamber.
Opposition leaders said they were not impressed by Berlusconi's
program.
"There was not a single specific proposal," Cesare Salvi, leader of the
leftist Progressive Alliance party.
On the neo-fascists, Salvi criticized Berlusconi for failing to condemn
a rally Saturday by hundreds of skinheads in the northern city of
Vincenza.
The Senate has 326 seats, and by Monday afternoon the premier could
count on certain support from only 154 senators, not including speaker
Carlo Scognamiglio, a Berlusconi ally who as leader of the chamber
traditionally takes no part in the vote.
The coalition which won the election comprises Berlusconi's Forza
Italia, the federalist Northern League of Umberto Bossi and the
National Alliance of neo-fascist Gianfranco Fini.
Berlusconi suffered a setback Monday with the defection of a Northern
League senator.
Gianfranco Miglio, senator and Northern League policy-maker, announced
he was leaving the federalist party and said he would vote against
Berlusconi's government.
Analysts attributed his defection to anger at not being nominated to
head the ministry of institutional reform in the incoming government.
Bossi said Monday in the newspaper La Stampa that Berlusconi had
rejected Miglio for the post in the light of the senator's verbal
hostility towards southern Italians.
Anticipating his departure, Bossi added: "The League is a mountain
(from which) the noise of a stone falling can hardly be heard."
Bossi and Fini have warned the senators that if they fail to deliver
the confidence vote fresh elections would be staged next month.
