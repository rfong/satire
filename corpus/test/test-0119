Rwandan refugee stoned to death 
A Rwandan refugee was Tuesday stoned to death in Kituko refugee camp
west of here, bringing to six the number of Hutus killed in acts of mob
and random violence in the past week in the six powderkeg camps dotted
around this border town, UN spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs said.
She said details of the stoning were still sketchy but said it was a
sign of rising tension in the camps, which house more than 800,000
Hutus who fled to Zaire in July after a three-month orgy of ethnic
bloodletting which began with the death in a suspicious plane crash of
Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6.
On Sunday night, two refugees were killed when unknown attackers flung
a hand grenade into in a tavern in Mugunga camp, adjoining Kituko,
which houses troops of the defeated Hutu army.
A doctor for Care Deutschland, who helped evacuate the 16 people
injured in the explosion, told AFP that one man died in the blast while
another man died later in the field hospital where first aid was being
applied to the victims.
He said a child lost both feet while lobotomies had to be performed on
two other refugees.
Sachs blamed boredom, frustration and increasing militancy in the
teeming camps for the increasing violence.
She believed the number of violent deaths being reported were "just the
tip of the iceberg," pointing out that foreign aid workers cleared out
of the camps at night.
"These incidents emphasise the urgent need for the deployment of an
international peacekeeping force in the camps," Sachs said.
