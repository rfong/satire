Manchester United defender poised for move to Portsmouth 
Manchester United defender Paul Parker was poised Thursday to move to
first division Portsmouth.
Parker, who has been linked with moves to Premiership-newcomers Derby
County and French first division side Marseille during the summer,
trained with Portsmouth on Wednesday.
Now Fratton Park boss Terry Fenwick hopes that his former team-mate,
now 32, can be persuaded to step down from the Premiership.
"Paul and I go back a long way," said Fenwick. "We were at QPR together
and so I'm hoping we can do a deal."
Fenwick is also looking to secure work permits for Yugoslavs Radmilo
Mihajlovic and Pedrag Spasic, currently on trial with Portsmouth.
