World Bank Approves Credit to Pakistan 
The World Bank has approved a credit of 56 million US dollars to
Pakistan for a private sector ground water development project in
Punjab province, according to the official Associated Press of Pakistan
today.
The project will increase the productivity of irrigation and drainage
systems and raise the incomes of farmers by mobilizing farmers to
operate and maintain ground water irrigation.
The credit, approved on Friday, will be provided by the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary lending
arm.
A senior official of the bank expressed the hope that the project will
reduce water costs and enhance agricultural production over 1 million
hectares of canal commandment areas in Punjab province.
It will benefit some 380,000 farm families, of which about 80 percent
are small farmers.
"The project adopts a new approach which redefines development in
Punjab," Masood Ahmed, senior irrigation engineer in the Agriculture
Operations Division for Pakistan at the World Bank was quoted as
saying.
The total cost of the project is estimated at 105 million dollars, of
which the IDA will finance about 56 million dollars, farmers about 32
million dollars for installing tube wells and improving the surface
irrigation system, and the Pakistan government about 17 million
dollars.
