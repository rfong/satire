Moving west-northwest at about 24 kilometers (15 miles) per hour, Bertha
struck the Virgin Islands Monday, causing trees to uproot and tearing the
roof off a school but there were no reports of injuries, said Ralph Johnson
of the Emergency Management Agency.
Officials there were thankful the storm did not cause more damage.
Residents of the Virgin Islands were still trying to recover from a
powerful hurricane last year that destroyed or damaged 45 percent of
the buildings on the islands. Buildings that had only been partly
rebuilt were especially vulnerable.
After Puerto Rico, Bertha was expected to hit the Dominican Republic on
the island of Hispaniola, where the population was put on "maximum
alert" and tourists at coastal hotels were being ordered to leave the
area, officials said.
Bertha was expected to strike the northern Dominican Republic at about
midnight (0400 GMT) Tuesday, according to officials with the Dominican
National Meteorological Office.
After hitting the Dominican Republic, Bertha could threaten the US
mainland, according to US National Weather Service meteorologist Kevin
McCarthy.
"The good news is this storm is relatively quick," meaning the weather
system's worst conditions will not occur over an extended period of
time, McCarthy said.
But after hitting Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and likely the
Bahamas, "Then it will threaten the southeastern US someplace," he
said.
"The track right now brings it towards south Florida but there's some
uncertainty," McCarthy said, noting it could veer toward the Gulf of
Mexico instead.
