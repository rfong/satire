More Foreigners Praised in Shanghai 
Six more foreigners were awarded prizes recently for their efforts in
helping with the economic and social development of Shanghai, the
largest economic center of China.
The six foreigners from Belgium, the Great Britain and Japan are all
businessmen working in Shanghai. They brought to 30 the total number of
those foreigners who have won the prize over the past three years.
The prize, an honorary prize named after the city flower of Shanghai,
White Yulan Magnolia, was launched by the municipal government in 1992
to honor outstanding foreign experts for their outstanding
contributions to Shanghai's social and economic development.
Similar prizes have been established for foreigners working in other
major Chinese cities, sources said.
