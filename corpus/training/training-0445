Palestinian shot dead after stabbing settler 
An Israeli soldier shot a Palestinian dead on the Gaza Strip Saturday
after the Palestinian stabbed a teenage Jewish settler, military
officials said.
The attack took place near the settlement of Neve Dekalim in the south
of the Strip.
Officials said the 17-year-old settler had been transferred by
helicopter to a hospital. His condition was serious, they said.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was expected to complain about continued
attacks on Israelis when he meets Palestine Liberation Organisation
chief Yasser Arafat at the Erez checkpoint into the Strip later in the
day.
