Coal Mine Safety Paramount 
Following the deaths of 159 people in coal mine accidents in the last
two months, China's State Administration of Coal Industry has stressed
the need for safety to be a top priority across the country.
The administration has asked managements to take immediate action to
prevent possible accidents and to shut down unsafe mines.
"Efforts should be mainly focused on the prevention of gas explosions
which are common causes of accidents in mines," the administration
said.
The accidents happened in Henan, Zhejiang, Liaoning provinces and the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and came to the attention of Premier
Zhu Rongji and Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo, who urged coal producers to be
more vigilant and improve safety.
