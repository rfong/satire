UAE people remain big spenders despite low oil prices 
United Arab Emirates (UAE) inhabitants are spending a record amount of
money on goods and services despite government austerity measures
prompted by low oil prices, an official report said Saturday.
Private consumption, which covers spending by individuals on consumer
goods and services, surged by 11.7 percent to a record 71.2 billion
dirhams (19.4 billion dollars) in 1994 from 63.7 billion dirhams (17.35
billion dollars) in 1993, according to the planning ministry report.
The report showed private consumption had steadily increased over the
past few years and the growth was faster than that of the population.
In contrast, government consumption rose by only 4.2 percent to 24.5
billion dirhams (6.67 billion dollars) in 1994 from 23.5 billion
dirhams (6.4 billion dollars) in 1993. Similar growth was recorded in
previous years.
The report expected final consumption, which includes government and
private consumption, to increase to 107 billion dirhams (29.1 billion
dollars) in 1995.
This will be coupled with a projected rise in imports to 85 billion
dirhams (23.1 billion dollars) from 80 billion dirhams (21.8 billion
dollars) in 1994.
The individual's share of final consumption stood as high as 11,700
dollars in 1994 and the share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at
around 16,500 dollars.
This indicates the country's nearly two million people spent an average
two thirds of their income on goods and services.
Bankers attributed the high spending to a sharp growth in construction,
trade, banking, insurance and other services sectors. They also cited
an expansion in the private sector as a result of government incentives
to boost its role in the domestic economy following the decline in
crude prices.
Such a decline has forced the UAE, a key OPEC producer, to slash
general expenditure over the past decade to tackle a persistent budget
deficit.
According to the report, total revenues plummeted to 39.1 billion
dirhams (10.65 billion dollars) in 1993 from 47.8 billion dirhams
(13.02 billion dollars) in 1991 while spending was slashed to 45.2
billion dirhams (12.31 billion dollars) from 56.8 billion dirhams
(15.47 billion dollars).
Despite the cut, the deficit persisted in 1993, standing at around 1.66
billion dollars.
