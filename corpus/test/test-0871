Vietnam Boosts Garment, Textile Exports 
Vietnam has made progress in its efforts to boost garment and textile
exports.
Vietnam's garment and textile industry earned 1 billion U.S. dollars
from exports in the first eight months of this year, a year-on-year
increase of 8.4 percent, according to a report of Vietnam News Agency
(VNA) on Wednesday.
Since the beginning of this year the industry has reduced the average
cost of production by 20 percent to raise the competitiveness of its
products. The industry plans to increase its export turnover to more
than 1.5 billion dollars in 1999.
Vietnam earned 1.38 billion dollars from garment and textile exports
last year as it increased labor productivity more than three fold
compared with 1992.
Although the labor productivity of Vietnam's garment and textile
industry has improved, its average labor cost per product is still
higher than that in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea.
The average wage of Vietnamese textile and garment workers increased
from 200 dollars a year in 1990 to 550 dollars in 1996 and 690 dollars
in 1998, according to the U.N. Industrial Development Organization.
Vietnam's garment and textile industry now is facing difficulties in
narrowing the gap of development between the garment and textile
sectors. The export turnover of the garment sector in 1998 increased 13
times over 1990 while that of the textile sector went up only 6
times.he weaving machines have been renewed and the rest are
out-of-date pieces of equipment that have been used for at least 25
years, according to the Vietnam Garment and Textile Corporation.
To improve the situation and reach the 1999 export target, VNA
reported, Vietnam's garment and textile enterprises should further
improve their products' quality and production efficiency by improving
the production process and improving management practices. They should
also promote marketing and diversify the designs of their products.
