British experts unearth Christian presence on Gulf island 
British archaeologists excavating on a small Gulf island have unearthed
evidence of Christian civilisation before the advent of Islam, a member
of the team said Monday.
The excavations on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) island of Sir Bani
Yas revealed a large complex with at least one courtyard and no less
than 15 separate rooms, said chief archaeologist Geoffrey King.
He told the daily Emirates News that the complex included an area used
for cooking and other rooms, many with finely plastered walls and
doorways.
"As a result of earlier work, it had become clear to us that we were
dealing with buildings of considerable quality and importance, with
docoration deriving ultimately from the classical and late antique
world," he said.
"The role of at least one building on the site was clarified by the
discovery of three finely carved crosses that indicate the existence of
a Christian community on Sir Bani Yas on the eve of the coming of
Islam" in the 7th century.
King has headed a team excavating on Sir Bani Yas and other UAE islands
over the past two years at the request of President Sheikh Zayed ibn
Sultan al-Nahayan.
"The presence of Christians on Sir Bani Yas prior to Islam was
completely unexpected," the renowned archaeologist said.
"The length of the survival of this Christian community on Sir Bani
Yaas has yet to be determined.
"But the archaeological evidence suggests the settlement was not
deliberately destroyed, evidence of the traditional tolerance of Islam
for Christians as 'People of the Book.'"
