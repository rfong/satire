WFP nears midpoint in food aid appeal for North Korea 
The UN World Food Program said Friday it had raised more than 40
percent of its 41.6 million dollar food aid appeal for North Korea.
Mike Ross, spokesman for WFP North America, said the WFP estimates
North Korea may run out of food by May, and that the "most alarmist"
nongovernmental organizations say it could in March.
Australia recently pledged 2.5 million Australian dollars (roughly 1.9
million US) and New Zealand 100,000 New Zealand dollars (70,000 US), he
said.
Ross said that a total of 18 million dollars has been pledged in the
yearlong appeal so far, or 43 percent of the goal, he told AFP.
"It's not bad" for this early stage of the appeal, he said.
The WFP announced in early February an emergency appeal to provide
North Korea with 100,000 tonnes of food, enough to feed 1.7 million
North Koreans including 600,000 children under five who are threatened
by famine.
The United States was the first to answer it, pledging 10 million
dollars, followed by South Korea, with six million.
North Korea has been struggling with food shortages due to massive
flooding that has wiped out harvests over the past two years and
sparked fears of a famine of the scale that devastated Ethiopia in the
mid-1980s.
The North Koreans themselves predict the crisis will come in June, he
said, but "most people expect that they will run out sooner than that."
Catherine Bertini, executive director of the Rome-based UN agency, will
head a delegation of WFP officials visiting North Korea on March 15-18,
Ross said.
The team will visit the WFP office in Pyongyang and hopes to view
flood-affected areas, food distribution sites and meet with North
Korean officials.
