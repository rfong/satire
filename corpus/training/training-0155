Anti-Peace Rally Banned, Organizers Scuffle with Police 
Reversing itself for a second time in two weeks, the government banned
a demonstration Monday by opponents of the peace treaty with Israel.
The demonstration had been organized by 11 leftist and Muslim
fundamentalist groups opposed to last year's Jordan-Israel treaty and
the normalization of relations.
The government, which had approved the protest last week after banning
it earlier, gave no reason for the decision.
Hundreds of demonstrators defied the ban and gathered at a downtown
conference center in the Jordanian capital to denoucnce the government.
Police prevented the demonstrators from entering the building and beat
at least one protester, Ali Abu Sukar, deputy chief of the Engineer's
Association.
Organizers said they believed the government was irked by an eight-page
coalition document that calls for a boycott in all dealings with the
``Jewish enemy.''
They also decried the ban as a violation of their rights.
``This is a disgrace for democracy which the government boasts about,''
said Zayadeen, secretary-general of the Jordanian Communist Party,
referring to democratic reforms that began in 1989 and led to the
reemergence of a multiparty system.
