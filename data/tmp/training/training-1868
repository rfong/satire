The/DT new/JJ notes/NNS ,/, unveiled/VBN in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS in/IN September/NNP ,/, are/VBP due/JJ here/RB at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT month/NN or/CC early/RB in/IN February/NNP ,/, officially/RB to/TO help/VB combat/VB the/DT circulation/NN of/IN forgeries/NNS ./.

In/IN a/DT bid/NN to/TO avert/VB turmoil/NN and/CC abuses/NNS ,/, the/DT central/JJ bank/NN has/VBZ ruled/VBN in/IN agreement/NN with/IN eight/CD major/JJ commercial/JJ banks/NNS that/IN a/DT commission/NN of/IN two/CD percent/NN and/CC no/RB more/JJR will/MD be/VB charged/VBN for/IN exchanging/VBG current/JJ 100/CD dollar/NN notes/NNS for/IN the/DT new/JJ ones/NNS ./.

Bank/NNP deputy/NN chairman/NN Alexander/NNP Khandruyev/NNP calculated/VBD that/IN individual/JJ Russians/NNPS held/VBD more/JJR than/IN 12/CD million/CD dollars/NNS in/IN all/DT ./.

``/`` We/PRP have/VBP to/TO anticipate/VB the/DT Russian/JJ psychology/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP explained/VBD ./.

``/`` They/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO come/VB rushing/VBG to/TO swap/VB their/PRP$ old/JJ notes/NNS for/IN the/DT new/JJ ones/NNS ./. ''/''

Russians/NNPS traditionally/RB hoard/VBP their/PRP$ savings/NNS in/IN the/DT proverbial/JJ woolen/NN stocking/NN rather/RB than/IN in/IN a/DT bank/NN account/NN ./.
