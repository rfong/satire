Cyprus Expects PKK Leader not to be Extradited 
Cyprus expects that Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK), will not be extradited to Turkey, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said here Monday.
Speaking at his press briefing, the spokesman said European Union (EU)
considers human rights as the essence of its principles and is bound by
its own decision in Luxembourg on human rights violations in Turkey.
The EU has urged Turkey to improve its human rights record, to try and
solve the Kurdish problem, ameliorate its relations with Greece and
contribute to peace efforts in Cyprus before it joins the list of
candidate countries for EU accession negotiations.
"Given this and the fact that Turkey violates human rights repeatedly,
we expect that the Kurdish leader will not be extradited," Stylianides
said.
Ocalan was detained by Italian police Thursday night upon his arrival
in Rome aboard a Russian Airlines passenger plane from Moscow.
The spokesman also said that the Cypriot government "backs a political
solution to the Kurdish problem."
Meanwhile, Cypriot House Speaker Spyros Kyprianou Sunday sent a letter
to his Italian counterpart Luciano Violante, saying that he had been
informed with great concern of Ocalan's detention by the Italian
authorities.
Kyprianou urged Violante to use all his influence on the Italian
government to set free Ocalan and satisfy his request for political
asylum.
The PKK led by Ocalan has been fighting a separatist war for
independence in southeast Turkey since 1984.
