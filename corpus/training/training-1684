Tagliabue Says He Awaits Rams' Proposal 
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue sounded as if he expected the Rams to
submit a proposal soon regarding a possible move to St. Louis.
Tagliabue made his remarks in a press conference before the Raiders'
24-17 victory over the San Diego Chargers at Jack Murphy Stadium.
Although Tagliabue said he had not spoken with Rams executive vice
president John Shaw recently, he later hinted at what will transpire
when asked if Los Angeles would soon have only one pro football team.
``That's something we'll evaluate when we get an application from the
Rams,'' Tagliabue said.
The key word in the statement being ``when'' instead of ``if.''
``(Shaw will) present to us a conclusion of his own analysis, whether
it is to transfer or stay in Anaheim,'' Tagliabue added. ``If he
decides to submit something, he said he would do it under NFL
procedures.''
Tagliabue said he believed the league could prevent the Rams' possible
move if the ``application is not justified.''
However, NFL approval is considered a formality. The Raiders moved to
Los Angeles without it.
Tagliabue also continued his criticism of the Coliseum and said he met
in the past two weeks with Mayor Richard Riordan, Coliseum Commission
representatives and businessmen regarding a new stadium in Los Angeles.
He said the Coliseum does not merit consideration for hosting a Super
Bowl.
``I think there are problems with the Coliseum,'' he said. ``I don't
know if they're solvable or not. It's not a state-of-the-art
facility.''
Tagliabue said there has been discussion of sites for a new stadium but
refused to divulge them. He also has spoken with Raiders owner Al Davis
about the team's future in Los Angeles.
``I've had some conversations with Al on a pretty regular basis. He's
trying to see what can be accomplished in L.A.,'' Tagliabue said.
The commissioner said the NFL is discussing a rebate with the Fox
television network if the Rams, an NFC team, leave Southern California
even though the network's $1.6 billion TV contract does not require
one.
When asked if the Chargers would one day be Southern California's only
pro football team, Tagliabue said ``it is extremely unlikely. We will
have good strong representation in Southern California.''
Bender entered the contest in the first quarter, the earliest he's
played in a game, caught two passes for 14 yards and made several key
blocks.
``They said I'd get in there early,'' Bender said. ``I was more nervous
on the sideline before I went in there.''
Bender, who lives in Burbank, was signed by the Raiders as a free
agent.
``I caught more passes tonight than I did at 'SC,'' he said.
``Coming into the game, we knew Tom (Rathman) and Harvey (Williams) ...
were going to need a breather.
``When Wes and I came in, the guys calmed us down tremendously.''
``This is the third time I tried to make the team,'' said White, who
was activated in the eighth game. ``I think this game showed them. Once
they felt I showed my solid nerves in the game's pressure situations,
they felt, `Hey, this guy's ready.'''
