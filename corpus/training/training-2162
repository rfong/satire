Chris Whitney, a journeyman reserve for Washington, sank a
three-pointer to conclude a career-best 19-point effort and keep the
Bullets within reach with four seconds to play.
Brian Shaw added a final free throw for the Magic, which won only after
Bullet Tim Legler's three-pointer rolled off the back of the rim at the
buzzer.
"They hung in there, but we took over in over-time," O'Neal said. "As
far as Gheorghe goes, I was just able to take it to him and get past
him and go in for the dunk."
Orlando concluded a cross-country stretch of seven games in 11 days,
six of them on the road. They are likely to be seeded second in the
Eastern Conference playoffs behind the Chicago Bulls.
"Chicago is so far ahead nobody can catch them," Hardaway said. "Right
now we just want to rest. Then we want to work on winning on the road
as well as at home. That gives us a bigger challenge. Nothing is going
to come easy for us."
Tyson, who beat Frank Bruno six days ago in Las Vegas for the
heavyweight crown, missed the most exciting moments of the game.
He departed with 4:40 remaining in regulation time, missing eight
points and two blocks by O'Neal in the final 3:47. That pulled Orlando
from a five-point deficit when Tyson left into a tie at 101 entering
over-time.
Tyson was escorted into the arena by way of guarded stairs after the
game was four minutes old. Ushers and bodyguard kept the crowd at bay.
