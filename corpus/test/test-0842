Aid Convoys Move Toward Sarajevo Despite Harassment
Peacekeepers struggled Wednesday with the grim reality of heavy
fighting and Serb limits on their movement as frustrated NATO brass
pushed for changes in the U.N. Bosnia mission.
NATO planning to help strengthen, or alternately, to end the 2
1/2-year-old mission was likely to bump into the United Nations' own
reluctance to drastically change what increasingly appears an untenable
mission.
Two U.N. convoys rolled toward Sarajevo to distribute humanitarian aid,
a basic aim of the U.N. mission. Bosnian Serbs briefly shut down the
main route into the Bosnian capital Wednesday and also stopped the
convoys outside the city for inspection.
But officials hoped they would arrive at the Sarajevo airport before
the end of the day.
Peter Kessler, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
said two convoys with 239 tons of food were sent following one that
arrived Tuesday with 111 tons of aid. Land convoys are necessary
because Sarajevo's airlift has been suspended since Nov. 21.
There was more fighting just southwest of Sarajevo around Mount Igman,
where Bosnian government forces apparently were trying to threaten a
Serb supply route, and in far western Bosnia where Serbs were
reportedly counter-attacking against advancing Croat forces.
In northwest Bosnia, where combined forces of Serbs from Croatia and
Bosnia and renegade Muslims are battling Muslim-led government forces,
the United Nations reported heavy artillery and mortar fire around the
town of Bihac.
Two mortars hit the center of Bihac town, a U.N.-declared ``safe
area.'' One mortar hit a house, killing one person and wounding
another, said U.N. spokeswoman Claire Grimes in Zagreb, Croatia.
Heavy fighting was reported to the north of Bihac around Velika
Kladusa, where attackers were trying to seize the road south out of the
town, U.N. reports said.
The road passes near a logistics camp of a beleaguered Bangladeshi
battalion. On Monday, in what the United Nations termed a deliberate
attack by either Croatian Serbs or renegade Muslims, one Bangladeshi
was killed and four were wounded.
The U.N. command in Sarajevo turned down a request by the local
Bangladeshi commander for NATO air support during the Monday attack, in
an illustration of the limitations of the United Nations mission. U.N.
officials cited poor visibility and the danger of air attacks in a
built-up area.
The decision also led to new tensions with NATO officials, who
expressed frustration with the U.N. command's cautious approach.
In Brussels on Wednesday, NATO defense ministers called an emergency
meeting of top generals to discuss approaches to toughening the U.N.
response in Bosnia.
But it was unclear that they would be able to overcome U.N. resistance
to a tougher stance. The United Nations, not NATO, has control over the
mission, and the cautious approach of Japanese diplomat Yasushi Akashi
and other top U.N. officials in former Yugoslavia have been a
consistent irritant for NATO.
NATO airstrikes were called in three times three weeks ago against Serb
targets in the Bihac area. They did nothing to stop the Serbs, and led
them to vastly increase pressure on the U.N. mission.
They detained hundreds of peacekeepers and denied freedom of movement
to U.N. operations. Bosnian Serbs said they would not let up until
there was no more threat of airstrikes.
The Bosnian Serbs have eased the pressure slightly in the past week,
freeing most of the peacekeepers and allowing movement of some convoys.
That apparently is a reflection of a desire not to pressure the U.N.
mission so hard as to make a withdrawal likely.
Akashi met Wednesday with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in his
headquarters in Pale, just outside Sarajevo, on Wednesday. There was no
immediate report on the talks.
