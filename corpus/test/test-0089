European Commission Approves Reform Strategy 
The European Commission approved Wednesday an ambitious plan to
modernize its financial management and control, its strategic planning
and its personnel policy.
The plan, hailed by the commission as the most far-reaching in its
40-year history, won approval from all the 20 members of the
commission, the executive body of the European Union.
The commission said that the objective of the reform plan is to equip
the commission with the capability to fulfill its role with maximum
effectiveness in meeting the challenges facing the 15- nation bloc.
Romano Prodi, the commission president, said, "The objective of reform
is to provide the commission with an administration which is a model of
excellence, an administration which is also exemplary in its use of
information technology, working toward a paperless commission."
The reform plan was adopted after long consultations with the
commission staff of more than 16,000 via trade unions, the European
Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.
The commission also planned to cultivate a commission culture based on
service through the establishment of ethical standards and code of good
administrative behavior.
Prodi's commission took over last September after the previous
commission stepped down ensuing a scandal of misuse of public funds.
The new commission promised to reform and the reform plan was the
result of this undertaking. Prodi said that the commission is still to
perform the reform and the results of reform will be there after some
time for all to see.
Neil Kinnock, commission vice-president in charge of administrative
reform, told the press after answering questions at the European
Parliament that with the adoption of the reform plan, the commission
had reached the end of a process of reflection, preparation and
consultation.
"Now we (the commission) are at the beginning of the demanding period
of implementation as we further develop the reform and put it into
practice," he added.
