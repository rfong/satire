IOC Evaluation Commission Arrives in Greece 
The International Olympic Committe's evaluation commission arrived here
today to begin its examination of Athens' bid to host the 2004 games.
Led by German president of the committee Thomas Bach, the 19-member
commission met today with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis who
expressed his government's full support for the capital's bid for the
2004 Olympic games.
The evaluation commission will examine the Athens bid in detail during
a four-day visit. They will also inspect athletic and other facilities
as part of the effort to narrow the field of 11 bidders to four or five
finalists by next spring with a final decision on awarding the bid by
September 1997.
