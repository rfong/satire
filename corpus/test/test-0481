Canada Takes First at World Juniors with 6-4 Win over Finland 
Marty Murray had one goal and three assists to lead Canada to a 6-4 win
over Finland on Sunday and first place in the World Junior Ice Hockey
Championship.
Canada, with a 5-0 record, leads Sweden and Russia, tied for second at
4-1, after the Russians defeated the Swedes 6-4 in Calgary Sunday.
Murray's goal at 2:36 of the third period allowed Canada to hold on
after giving up two late goals in the final seconds of the second
period.
Alexandre Daigle put the game out of reach with his third goal of the
tournament at 4:58 of the third period.
Canada held a 4-1 lead, until the final 25 seconds of the second
period. On a four-on-two break, Janne Niinimaa broke in across the
Canadian blue-line and ripped a hard shot past Canadian goaltender Dan
Cloutier at 19:35.
Just 12 seconds later, Jussi Tarvainen, an Edmonton Oiler draft pick,
let a wrist shot go from inside the blue-line that missed, but
deflected back on to his stick. With Cloutier out of position,
Tarvainen pushed the shot in.
Canada went up 3-0 on scores by Larry Courville, Bryan McCabe and Todd
Harvey.
Petri Kokko relit the Finnish fires at 5:32 in the second when his low
point shot beat Canadian goaltender Dan Cloutier, with Canada playing a
man short.
Eric Daze restored Canada's three-goal lead when he took a pass from
Murray and rifled a wrist shot past goaltender Jussi Markkenen at 13:50
on the power play.
Finland's fourth goal came on a penalty shot after Veli-Pekka Nutikka
was hauled down on a breakaway by McCabe.
In the second game, the United States beat winless Germany 5-3 to
improve to 2-3. Deron Quint had two goals and Adam Deadmarsh, Shawn
Bates and Sean Haggerty also scored for the United States.
Earlier in Calgary, Alexander Kharlamov scored a short-handed goal
early in the third period to spark Russia to its win over Sweden.
With the score 4-4 and Russia saddled with an interference penalty,
Kharlamov blocked a shot at the blue line, took the puck and outraced
two Swedish defensemen before firing it home.
Sergei Vychedkevitch added a power-play goal.
Rouslan Batychine, with a goal and two assists, Vadim Charifianov, Ilja
Vorobiev and Vitali Yachemnev also scored for the Russians.
Dick Tarnstrom led Sweden by scoring his first two goals of the
tournament while Anders Eriksson collected three assists. Anders
Soderberg, with his fifth goal of the tournmanet, and Niklas Sundstrom
also scored.
Trailing 5-4 early in the third period, Sweden's Peter Strom had a
chance to tie the score. Strom led a three-on-none breakaway but hit
the post with his shot.
In Sunday's other game, the Czech Republic beat Ukraine 10-1 at Red
Deer.
