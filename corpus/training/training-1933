Guido Tognoni, FIFA's top press officer, confirmed officially Maradona
had tested positive.
In 1986 the Spanish player Ramon Caldere was suspended for one match
after a Mexican doctor prescribed a medicine for diaorrhea which
contained a banned drug.
But Tognoni said FIFA had to take into account Maradona's drugs record.
