PNA Asks for Jordanian Actions Against Hamas Leaders 
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Information Minister Yasser Abed
Rabbo is due to travel to Amman today to ask Jordan to take actions
against Hamas leaders in the kingdom, Israel Radio reported.
In Amman, he is expected to meet with Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Information Khalid Karaki, demanding that Jordan take
more actions than warnings against Hamas spokespersons who issued
statements and declarations from Jordan.
After last week's suicide attacks in the Gaza Strip, which killed eight
people, the PNA asked Jordan to crack down on the Jordan-based Hamas
activists.
Jordan has agreed to the PNA request and sent warnings to Hamas leaders
in the country not to use Jordanian territories as a base of violent
attacks against Israelis.
