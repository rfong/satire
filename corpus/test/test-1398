Former Yugoslav president claims hard-line Milosevic will wreck government 
A former close ally of Slobodan Milosevic warned in a press interview
Friday that the Serbian head of state should accept election defeat or
risk wrecking the Belgrade government.
Borisav Yovic, former Yugoslav president and a senior Serbian
Socialist, told The Guardian that Milosevic's party would turn against
him unless he accepted election defeat and reduced the political
influence of his wife, Mirjana Markovic.
The interview was published amid reports in Belgrade of a possible
compromise over disputed local election results that have caused more
than two months of street protests there.
Jovic, one of the president's closest wartime associates, was bitterly
critical of Milosevic and his wife Mirjana Markovic, and predicted a
break-up of the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) and a political shakeup.
He implored Milosevic to recognize the election results or seek
compromise with the Zajedno opposition coalition.
"I don't believe he is psychologically capable of even realising his
mistake and correcting it," he said.
"If someone thinks they can do anything against the regulations of his
party, against the constitution and the law, that is a very serious
situation."
"I haven't met a single person who supports these policies, whether
they're a leader, or a member, or not even in the Socialist Party,"
said Jovic, adding that the iron fist with which Milosevic ruled his
party meant any party leader voicing doubt or criticism would "be
instantly dismissed."
Unless the president relented, warned Jovic, he risked witnessing "a
mass defection to a new 'democratic left' party" capable of outpolling
the Socialists in a future election.
Jovic said the police would turn on Milosevic if he tried to use them
against street demonstrators, saying, "Why should the police fight
against ordinary people? They are thinking people too."
Jovic, who was chairman of Yugoslavia's collective presidency for a
year from May 1990, said he had not decided whether he would lead such
a party, saying he was in poor health with kidney problems.
Jovic, in his memoirs, "The Last Days of the Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia," says he and Milosevic forged a close partnership during
the war, plotting military and political strategy together.
But the bond was ruptured when Jovic complained about the rising power
of Milosevic's wife and her party, the Yugoslav United Left.
And on returning from the Dayton, Ohio, peace talks in 1995, Milosevic
dismissed him at a 17-minute party meeting which Jovic still claims was
unconstitutional.
