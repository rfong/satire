Resumption of Diplomatic Ties with U.S. Possible, Says Iranian Ambassador 
Iranian Ambassador to France Al Reza Moaiyeri said Tuesday that it
would be possible to resume diplomatic relations between Iran and the
United States.
"We have condemned the attacks against the United States though we do
not have diplomatic relations with the U.S. government..." said
Moaiyeri in Brest, a port city in Western France where he is heading an
Iranian delegation for economic exchanges.
"The United States supports the normalization of its relations with
Iran but it takes time to re-establish these relations. There will be
conditions," said the ambassador without elaborating.
Washington broke off diplomatic ties with Tehran after militant Iranian
students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and held
52 American hostages for 444 days.
In 1998, Iran's reformist President Mohammad Khatami called for "a
crack in the wall of mistrust" between Iran and the United States and
proposed people-to-people contact and cultural and sports exchanges to
help warm up relations.
Iran was listed by the U.S. State Department as chief sponsor of
terrorism for years. However, Washington welcomed Iran's recent
condemnation of September 11 terrorist attacks, expressing the
willingness to explore the possibility of Iran's joining the broad
international coalition.
Iran supports Afghanistan's opposition Northern Alliance, which has
been fighting the incumbent Taliban regime. Taliban openly supports
Osama bin Laden, whom the U.S. terms as the prime suspect behind the
terror attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon
in Washington.
