DPRK: 21st Century Should Be One of Independence 
The 21st century should be a century of independence in which
dominationism and high-handedness are eliminated and sovereignty of all
states equally respected, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) stressed here Saturday.
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the United Nations
General Assembly, DPRK Minister for Foreign Affairs Paek Nam Sun said
that in order to bring about a new century of independence and durable
peace, a just international order never tolerating high-handness and
arbitrariness should be established.
To this end, the principles of respect for sovereignty should be
strictly adhered to as the supreme principle in international
relations, and the assertion that disarmament, human rights and
humanitarian issues should be placed above sovereignty should be firmly
denounced as a dangerous attempt to justify high-handness and
arbitrariness, the minister said.
"Disputes cannot be settleed properly by means of high-handness and
arbitrariness such as sanctions and the use of force. They should be
resolved through dialogues and negotiations on all accounts," Paek Nam
Sun said.
"What is important in establishing a just international order is to
ensure fairness in the formulation and application of international
treaties relating to disarmament, human rights and so forth. In
particular, the double standard of abusing international law as a
pretext for interference in the internal affairs of and use of force
against sovereign states should be strictly rejected," he added.
