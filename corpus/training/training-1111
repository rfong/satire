France to develop naval cruise missile 
France is to press ahead with developing a new cruise missile to be
deployed by the country's navy from 2011, the defense ministry said
Thursday.
"By the end of February the ministry will sign the feasibility order
authorising the development of a prototype. The programme is on track,"
said spokesman Jean-Francois Bureau.
The ministry is planning on a total of 250 missiles, at a cost of 785
million euros (691 million dollars). Multi-mission frigates will be
equipped with them from 2011 and Barracuda submarines from 2015, he
said.
The missiles will be developed by the European group MBDA, which
belongs jointly to BAE Systems of Britain, the European constructor
EADS and the Italian Finmeccanica.
MBDA has already developed the air-to-ground cruise missiles Apache and
Scalp-EG, which are due to come into service with the French air force
in the next two years.
