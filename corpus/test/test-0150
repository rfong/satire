College Football Coach Sues Own School for Legal Fees 
Coach Dennis Erickson has filed a lawsuit against the University of
Miami, asking the school to pay for his legal fees from the Bryan
Fortay case.
The fees stem from Fortay's dlrs 10 million lawsuit against the
university, alleging the school reneged on an oral contract that he
would be the starting quarterback.
Fortay's lawsuit also charges the university was negligent in hiring
former academic adviser Tony Russell, who is now serving a prison
sentence for his role in a Pell Grant scandal.
Although most of the counts in the original lawsuit were thrown out, a
federal judge has ruled that Fortay's lawsuit could proceed on two and
possibly three counts. That allowed Fortay to refile the breach of
contract portion of the case.
Erickson filed his lawsuit Dec. 30 in Dade Circuit Court.
University General Counsel Robert Blake would only say that the amount
of money Erickson is seeking is ``substantial.''
Erickson was on the road recruiting and couldn't be reached for
comment. No one answered at the office of his attorney, Robert Dickman,
Thursday evening, and his home number is unpublished.
According to Blake, Erickson was offered legal representation with the
firm of Podhurst Orseck Josephsberg, which represents UM in the Fortay
case. Those fees are being paid for by the Federal Insurance Company.
But Erickson, Blake says, wanted his own attorney and retained Dickman
to represent him. Now Erickson wants to be reimbursed by the school for
the fees he paid Dickman.
Blake said he expects the matter to be settled out of court in the next
few weeks.
Erickson, who has two national championships at Miami (1989 and '91),
could be headed to the National Football League. He will be meeting
with the owners of the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos.
