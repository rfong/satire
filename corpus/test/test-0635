EU to Help Reform Steel Industry in Central, Eastern Europe 
The European Commission, executive body of the European Union (EU),
reiterated Tuesday its intention to help restructure the steel industry
in central and eastern European nations.
Saying that the industry was in a precarious state, the commission
proposed to help directly in the reform, or act as a catalyst to
stimulate investment from international financial institutions and
private sectors.
The commission also pledged to boost the industry's competitiveness and
promote dialogue between central and eastern European countries and the
EU.
To ensure that the restructuring is a success, those countries will
have to comply with agreements and priorities specified in the
accession partnership programs, the commission said.
Those nations should also adopt a sound and comprehensive steel
restructuring program and strictly observe state aid rules, it added.
Commission officials say the restructuring is necessary to address
problems of over-capacity and lack of competition in central and
eastern Europe, but the costs are high.
The officials estimate a need for 10 billion U.S. dollars between 1994
and 2002 to pay for the social, regional and industrial aspects of
restructuring.
