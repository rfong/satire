S.Africa Ratifies Chemical Weapons Convention 
South Africa has become the 37th country to ratify the convention on
the prohibition, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons,
the document commonly known as "the Chemical Weapons Convention".
According to a South African Foreign Ministry statement issued here
today, the ratification underlines South Africa's commitment to the
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
This is the first official statement on the issue since South Africa
ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention on September 13 this year.
The convention has been signed by 159 states and the process of
ratification is still underway.
Implementation of the convention will be supervised by an organization
for the prohibition of chemical weapons to be established in a year or
two in the Hague, Netherlands.
A preparatory commission, composed of the convention's 159 signatory
states, has been at work in the Hague since January 1993.
