Cyprus Bans Poisonous PVC Toys 
Cyprus has banned the sale of baby toys made of PVC (polyvinyl
chloride) that has been softened by chemicals known as phthalates, the
Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
Cyprus' Commerce and Industry Minister Nicos Rolandis announced the ban
on Friday, which was effective immediately.
The ban made Cyprus the first European Union (EU) applicant state to
ban the toys.
According to the report, these toys leak yet-undetermined amounts of
the toxic phthalates into babies' saliva if they are chewed over a
period of time.
The EU has been mulling banning the toys "for quite some time," but
only eight of its 15 members wanted an outright ban on them, Rolandis
said.
"We are in the process of withdrawing them from the shelves of shops.
The stores have to remove them immediately," he said.
Rolandis said his ministry also contacted importers, who agreed
immediately to remove the toys from warehouse stocks, and also issued
warnings to all retailers.
