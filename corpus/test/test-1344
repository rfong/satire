Dole in "excellent health": medical report 
Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole, who turns 73 Monday, passed
his latest physical examination with flying colors and is in "excellent
health," his physician said Sunday.
Dole showed no evidence of recurring prostate cancer, said John Eisold,
the attending physician of the US Congress. The former Kansas senator
had his cancerous prostate gland removed in 1991.
In a letter released with a detailed report on the candidate's physical
examination in June, including laboratory and electroencepholograph
results, Eisold told Dole "overall, you remain in excellent health."
He noted that Dole's cholesterol level had fallen 28 points to 154,
reflecting "superb control with medication, diet and exercise."
The trim, 1.8-meter (six-foot-) tall World War II veteran also could
probably enjoy a slice of birthday cake with little worry. The doctor
said his weight was unchanged at 80.1 kilograms (178 pounds) from a
year ago.
Included with the report was a similarly detailed one from 1995. It was
the second consecutive year Dole has released a comprehensive medical
report detailing his medical history and the results of his most recent
physical examination.
The health records are "setting a standard for disclosure in the 1996
presidential campaign," Dole's campaign organization said in a
statement.
They include information on his mild color blindness -- "no clinical
impairment," his regimen of regular aerobic exercise and a healthy
diet, and bouts of asymptomatic upset stomach since 1987 that he
controls with over-the-counter medication.
Dole's birthday Monday reminds voters just three and a half months
before the November 5 election of the 23-year age gap separating him
and his rival President Bill Clinton, who turns 50 in August.
If elected, Dole would be the oldest US president to take office for a
first term.
Public opinion polls show that Dole's age is an issue with voters, who
have given Clinton about a 20-point lead.
Concern seems most acute among Dole's contemporaries, who could be hard
hit by Republicans' plan to reduce federal medical benefits for them.
A recent Los Angeles Times poll of voters over 65 showed Dole trailing
nearly 30 points behind Clinton, who has vowed to protect their social
safety net from the Republican ax.
Dole is planning to mark his birthday publicly with a charity event at
a soup kitchen in Washington and a visit to his hometown in Russell,
Kansas.
