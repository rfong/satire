Darts/JJ players/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN keen/JJ interest/NN in/IN the/DT ``/`` Pub/NNPS Tennis/NNP ''/'' game/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB like/IN darts/NN ,/, but/CC bigger/JJR ,/, and/CC no/DT numbers/NNS ./. ''/''

Tennis/NNS is/VBZ an/DT absolute/JJ doddle/NN in/IN comparison/NN ./.

All/DT I/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB is/VBZ whack/VB the/DT ball/NN into/IN the/DT huge/JJ area/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT net/JJ ,/, much/RB easier/JJR than/IN getting/VBG a/DT pin/NN with/IN wings/NNS to/TO fit/VB in/IN a/DT 1/CD inch/NN square/NN on/IN a/DT darts/NN board/NN from/IN 6ft/NN away/RB I/PRP can/MD tell/VB you/PRP ./.
