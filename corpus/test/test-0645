Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China, left here today for Vancouver to attend the
meetings of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
scheduled for November 24-25.
Before his departure, Tung told reporters at the airport that this is
the first time for HKSAR to attend such an important event in the
region by the name of "Hong Kong, China" under the concept of "one
country, two systems."

Hong Kong's situation after the handover.

future economic and trade cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

Hong Kong is very bright despite the affect of the recent financial
turbulence.

Chile, Hong Kong (China), Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore,
