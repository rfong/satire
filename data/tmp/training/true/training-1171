WASHINGTON/NNP -/: A/DT United/NNP States/NNPS even/RB more/RBR introverted/JJ than/IN during/IN the/DT past/JJ two/CD years/NNS is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS immediate/JJ result/NN of/IN the/DT Republican/JJ capture/NN of/IN Congress/NNP ./.

The/DT midterm/NN elections/NNS confirm/VBP the/DT verdict/NN of/IN the/DT 1992/CD presidential/JJ election/NN :/: success/NN abroad/RB ,/, be/VB it/PRP in/IN Iraq/NNP or/CC Haiti/NNP ,/, is/VBZ scarcely/RB worth/JJ a/DT vote/NN at/IN the/DT polls/NNS ./.

If/IN President/NNP Bill/NNP Clinton/NNP plans/VBZ to/TO make/VB up/RP for/IN his/PRP$ loss/NN of/IN control/NN over/IN the/DT domestic/JJ agenda/NN by/IN a/DT flurry/NN of/IN activity/NN overseas/RB he/PRP will/MD have/VB his/PRP$ work/NN cut/VB out/RP ./.

With/IN the/DT possible/JJ exception/NN of/IN a/DT second/JJ round/NN with/IN Saddam/NNP Hussein/NNP ,/, voters/NNS want/VBP to/TO keep/VB American/JJ involvement/NN in/IN other/JJ countries/NNS to/TO a/DT minimum/NN ./.

The/DT same/JJ mood/NN pervades/VBZ Washington/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB that/IN the/DT end/NN to/TO American/JJ participation/NN in/IN implementing/VBG the/DT arms/NNS embargo/NN on/IN Bosnia/NNP was/VBD unexpected/JJ ./.

But/CC by/IN casually/RB leaking/VBG the/DT details/NNS to/TO the/DT U.S./NNP press/NN last/JJ week/NN before/IN briefing/NN European/JJ ministers/NNS ,/, the/DT administration/NN underlined/VBD the/DT priority/NN it/PRP gives/VBZ to/TO domestic/JJ affairs/NNS ./.

Among/IN Republicans/NNPS there/EX are/VBP signs/NNS of/IN the/DT same/JJ flip/JJ tone/NN ,/, with/IN Senator/NNP Robert/NNP Dole/NNP recommending/VBG U.S./NNP troops/NNS leave/VB Haiti/NNP by/IN Thanksgiving/NNP next/JJ week/NN ./.

After/IN a/DT defeat/NN as/IN thumping/VBG as/IN that/DT suffered/VBD by/IN President/NNP Clinton/NNP last/JJ week/NN it/PRP may/MD be/VB too/RB much/JJ to/TO expect/VB anybody/NN in/IN the/DT administration/NN to/TO care/VB about/IN the/DT ripples/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ causing/VBG abroad/RB ./.

The/DT Republicans/NNPS also/RB are/VBP high/JJ on/IN the/DT euphoria/NN of/IN victory/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT defeated/JJ supporters/NNS of/IN the/DT military/JJ regime/NN in/IN Haiti/NNP ,/, still/RB the/DT largest/JJS armed/JJ force/NN in/IN the/DT country/NN if/IN the/DT U.S./NNP troops/NNS are/VBP removed/VBN ,/, may/MD well/RB take/VB Dole/NNP 's/POS recommendation/NN as/IN a/DT sign/NN that/IN they/PRP should/MD keep/VB their/PRP$ weapons/NNS oiled/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ real/JJ clash/NN between/IN Clinton/NNP and/CC the/DT new/JJ order/NN in/IN Congress/NNP is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO come/VB over/RP the/DT GATT/NNP world/NN trade/NN talks/NNS ./.

In/IN a/DT letter/NN to/TO the/DT President/NNP ,/, the/DT incoming/JJ chairman/NN of/IN the/DT Senate/NNP Foreign/NNP Relations/NNPS Committee/NNP ,/, Senator/NNP Jesse/NNP Helms/NNP ,/, asked/VBD him/PRP to/TO delay/VB a/DT vote/NN on/IN the/DT pact/NN until/IN next/JJ year/NN ./.

``/`` If/IN you/PRP will/MD agree/VB to/TO this/DT ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Helms/NNP ,/, ``/`` I/PRP can/MD assure/VB you/PRP that/IN it/PRP will/MD have/VB an/DT exceedingly/RB positive/JJ effect/NN on/IN my/PRP$ making/VBG certain/JJ that/IN the/DT administration/NN 's/POS position/NN on/IN all/DT foreign/JJ policy/NN matters/NNS during/IN the/DT 104th/JJ Congress/NNP will/MD be/VB considered/VBN fairly/RB and/CC fully/RB ./. ''/''

Threats/NNS do/VBP not/RB come/VB much/JJ blunter/NN than/IN this/DT ./.

But/CC Clinton/NNP can/MD not/RB really/RB afford/VB to/TO delay/VB ./.

The/DT agreement/NN ,/, between/IN 123/CD countries/NNS ,/, took/VBD 12/CD years/NNS to/TO negotiate/VB and/CC any/DT changes/NNS would/MD kill/VB the/DT pact/NN ./.

The/DT White/NNP House/NNP may/MD also/RB consider/VB it/PRP in/IN its/PRP$ interests/NNS to/TO push/VB ahead/RB with/IN GATT/NNP because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN on/IN which/WDT Republicans/NNPS are/VBP so/RB plainly/RB divided/VBN ./.

The/DT new/JJ Speaker/NNP of/IN the/DT House/NNP ,/, Newt/NNP Gingrich/NNP ,/, favors/VBZ it/PRP ,/, while/IN Dole/NNP ,/, the/DT majority/NN leader/NN in/IN the/DT Senate/NNP ,/, is/VBZ on/IN the/DT fence/NN ./.

Nothing/NN would/MD raise/VB Clinton/NNP 's/POS spirits/NNS more/JJR than/IN a/DT serious/JJ Republican/JJ split/NN ./.

The/DT Republicans/NNPS may/MD also/RB be/VB divided/VBN on/IN how/WRB far/RB to/TO try/VB to/TO change/VB Clinton/NNP 's/POS supportive/JJ policy/NN on/IN Russia/NNP ./.

President/NNP Boris/NNP Yeltsin/NNP has/VBZ already/RB said/VBD he/PRP fears/VBZ U.S.-Russian/JJ relations/NNS may/MD deteriorate/VB ./.

The/DT priority/NN given/VBN to/TO Russia/NNP by/IN Strobe/NNP Talbot/NNP ,/, the/DT Deputy/NNP Secretary/NNP of/IN State/NNP ,/, will/MD be/VB hard/JJ to/TO maintain/VB ./.

In/IN the/DT distribution/NN of/IN aid/NN ,/, Helms/NNP and/CC the/DT Republicans/NNPS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO push/VB for/IN more/JJR money/NN for/IN the/DT non-Russian/JJ republics/NNS and/CC less/JJR for/IN the/DT Russians/NNPS ./.

They/PRP may/MD also/RB be/VB more/RBR antagonistic/JJ to/TO Moscow/NNP over/IN territorial/JJ disputes/NNS ,/, notably/RB over/IN control/NN of/IN the/DT Caspian/NNP oil/NN fields/NNS ./.

At/IN the/DT center/NN of/IN Republican/NNP strategy/NN is/VBZ a/DT determination/NN not/RB to/TO let/VB Clinton/NNP win/VB any/DT victories/NNS that/WDT may/MD strengthen/VB his/PRP$ hand/NN in/IN the/DT run-up/NN to/TO the/DT 1996/CD presidential/JJ election/NN ./.

His/PRP$ successes/NNS in/IN Haiti/NNP ,/, North/NNP Korea/NNP and/CC Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP in/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ months/NNS did/VBD him/PRP little/RB good/JJ in/IN the/DT polling/NN booth/NN but/CC they/PRP would/MD probably/RB have/VB been/VBN impossible/JJ without/IN a/DT Democratic/NNP Congress/NNP ./.

Policy/NNP on/IN Bosnia/NNP may/MD not/RB ,/, at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, change/VB that/RB much/RB ./.

But/CC it/PRP will/MD be/VB more/RBR difficult/JJ for/IN Clinton/NNP to/TO fudge/VB ,/, by/IN gestures/NNS of/IN solidarity/NN with/IN the/DT Bosnians/NNPS that/WDT change/VBP nothing/NN ./.

And/CC if/IN anything/NN goes/VBZ wrong/JJ ,/, Republicans/NNPS will/MD want/VB him/PRP to/TO carry/VB the/DT blame/NN ./.

Nor/CC is/VBZ it/PRP just/RB Republicans/NNPS nipping/VBG at/IN his/PRP$ heels/NNS that/WDT will/MD cramp/VB Clinton/NNP 's/POS never/RB very/JJ expansive/JJ style/NN ./.

The/DT extent/NN of/IN his/PRP$ electoral/JJ defeat/NN is/VBZ so/RB great/JJ that/IN he/PRP will/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT lame/JJ duck/NN president/NN by/IN the/DT leaders/NNS of/IN every/DT country/NN with/IN which/WDT he/PRP deals/VBZ ./.

He/PRP will/MD find/VB it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO make/VB policy/NN decisions/NNS look/VB convincing/JJ where/WRB they/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB bipartisan/JJ support/NN ./.

If/IN Clinton/NNP really/RB had/VBD carried/VBN out/RP a/DT distinctively/RB liberal/JJ foreign/JJ policy/NN in/IN the/DT past/JJ two/CD years/NNS ,/, as/IN the/DT Republicans/NNPS alleged/VBD in/IN the/DT election/NN campaign/NN ,/, then/RB he/PRP would/MD now/RB be/VB in/IN real/JJ trouble/NN ./.

But/CC his/PRP$ radicalism/NN was/VBD always/RB overstated/VBN both/DT by/IN himself/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ opponents/NNS ./.

The/DT Republicans/NNPS may/MD want/VB to/TO smother/VB any/DT signs/NNS of/IN Clinton/NNP taking/VBG the/DT initiative/NN in/IN foreign/JJ affairs/NNS in/IN the/DT next/JJ two/CD years/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX was/VBD little/JJ sign/NN of/IN his/PRP$ doing/VBG so/RB anyway/RB ./.
