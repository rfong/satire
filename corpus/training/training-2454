Bonn Adviser: Kosovar Serbs Must Have Equal Rights
A senior adviser to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Thursday said
the Serbs in Kosovo must be treated equally as the Albanians and they must
enjoy same rights in the same region.
Michael Steiner, Schroeder's consultant for foreign affairs, gave the
speech to a Berlin radio one day before the Chancellor's visit to
Kosovo.
"The critical point of the mission is just what the (German) federal
government has expected from the very beginning--it also involves those
who have been the majority but now are minority," said Steiner.
The Serbs living in Kosovo, or having lived there, must "naturally
obtain their human rights," he stressed, adding:" all those who had to
flee must be able to return now."
Accompanied by Steiner, Schroeder is due to visit the war-torn region,
where thousands of Serbs were reportedly fleeing after Yugoslav forces
retreated.
Schroeder's Kosovo schedule will include talks with Kosovar Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova and the rebelling UCK commander Hashim Thaci. The
visit is aimed to make preparation for the Balkan summit on July 30.
