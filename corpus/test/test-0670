Authorities Count Costs As Final Flood Evacuees Return Home 
As the last of 250,000 flood evacuees headed home Monday, Dutch
authorities were left holding a whopping bill for a disaster that
didn't happen.
The big money will go to renovate hundreds of kilometers (miles) of
earthen medieval dikes that threatened to let go and flood vast
low-lying areas in the southeast.
Economics Ministry spokesman Jan van Diepen refused to give even a
general figure for overall damage. But various estimates have put the
cost of dike repair alone at hundreds of millions of dollars.
Last week, emergency teams fought desperate sandbag battles to buttress
the soaked and weakened dikes brimming with flood waters streaming down
the Maas and Waal rivers from Germany, Belgium and France.
The threat that the dikes would give way forced the largest evacuation
in Dutch history: a quarter of a million people in this nation of 15.5
million.
Residents of the last two threatened villages started returning Monday
morning after dike watchers Sunday declared the river dams near
Gorinchem-Oost and Boven-Hardinxveld to be safe.
Packed cars dragging furniture-filled trailers hit the highways along
with farmers taking evacuated livestock home.
Anja Kolderijn, 27, was busy clearing empty bird cages out of her
apartment in Culemborg. They'd been stored there by the pet shop below
her during the flood threat.
``It's just great to be home and stop being a burden on other people,''
said Kolderijn, who stayed with a friend. ``There was a great feeling
of relief to get back and see everything dry.''
Every household forced to join the exodus will get $290 from the
government. But for those shoveling the mud out of their homes, that
won't make much of a dent.
Because the Netherlands is flood-prone, with half of its land below sea
level, there is no flood insurance.
Dike repair is a contentious issue in the Netherlands. Residents say
the dikes have been allowed to deteriorate because of red tape and
environmentalist opposition to repairs that might scar the landscape.
Although none of the 530 kilometers (330 miles) of dikes crumbled under
the onslaught of the Maas and Waal rivers, many now bear deep new
battle scars.
Waterways Minister Annemarie Jorritsma has already speeded up a
long-term dike repair schedule. Government ministers are holding an
emergency meeting Tuesday to determine whether new laws are needed to
expedite wholesale renovation of the region's dike system.
Meanwhile, angry business groups pleaded with the government Monday for
more compensation for businesses hurt by the floods.
Prime Minister Wim Kok has pledged that no business will go bankrupt
because of the flooding.
``That is what they say, but what they want to do with this statement
is very unclear,'' said Peter van Geffen, spokesman for the chambers of
commerce in Gelderland province.
He estimated that, in lost business alone, the evacuation cost 15,000
Gelderland companies a total of $82 million each day for up to seven
days.
Damage and business losses in the southern Limburg province, where the
Maas river overflowed its banks, will push the final figure higher.
The government has agreed to pay businesses 65 percent to 90 percent of
their evacuation and water damage costs, minus a $1,200 deductible and
up to an as-yet undetermined ceiling. It says it will not compensate
for lost earnings.
Similar compensation would be paid to farmers.
