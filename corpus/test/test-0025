EU Approves DVD Patent Licensing Plan 
The European Union (EU) said Monday it had approved an agreement for
some companies that develop the digital versatile disc (DVD) technology
to pool their respective patents.
The agreement, consisting of a "Patent Pool" for patents covering
applications of DVD technology, allows interested manufacturers to
obtain a license for all necessary DVD patents rapidly, said the
European Commission, the EU's executive body.
The parties to the agreement are Hitachi Ltd., Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. Ltd, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Time Warner Inc and
Toshiba Corp.
A DVD is the same size as a compact disc, but with more than seven
times of its capacity. By using compression technology, a DVD disc can
store video and audio signals, as well as computer data and software
allowing a single DVD-Video disc to hold a two- hour feature film.
According to the European Commission, certain holders of essential
patents have agreed to license their patents through a single
non-exclusive and non-discriminatory license program to be administered
by Toshiba Corporation of Tokyo.
The companies submitted the agreement to the Commission in May 1999.
Through an in-depth investigation, the Commission's competition
services found that this patent pool would help promote technical and
economic progress by allowing quick and efficient introduction of the
DVD technology.
The agreement does not contain unnecessary or excessive restrictions on
competition, the Commission said in a statement.
