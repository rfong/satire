The/DT Netherlands/NNPS ,/, which/WDT recently/RB said/VBD it/PRP will/MD not/RB toughen/VB drugs/NNS laws/NNS ,/, opposes/VBZ the/DT draft/NN European/JJ ruling/NN which/WDT envisages/VBZ harmonising/VBG legislation/NN of/IN various/JJ EU/NNP member/NN states/NNS and/CC ensuring/VBG greater/JJR international/JJ cooperation/NN between/IN police/NN forces/NNS ,/, customs/NNS officers/NNS and/CC the/DT judiciary/NN ./.
