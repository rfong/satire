Heavy fighting rages as troops advance on Tamil stronghold
Fierce battles raged in northern Sri Lanka Monday as security forces
kept up an advance on the key rebel stronghold and the death toll in
this latest bout of violence rose to 115, the military said.
Security forces killed at least 75 guerrillas from the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and lost 29 of their own when advancing
through Tamil rebel-held territory in the northern Jaffna peninsula,
the military said.
More than 50 soldiers and about 150 LTTE fighters were also wounded in
the fierce battles overnight and early Monday, a military spokesman
said.
As fighting escalated in the Jaffna peninsula amid stiff rebel
resistance to the six-day-old army advance, the LTTE retaliated by
killing six more Sinhalese villagers in the island's southeast on
Monday, the spokesman said.
"Troops confronted terrorists at several places (in the peninsula).
Troops retaliated with small arms, mortar and artillery fire forcing
terrorists to flee with their casualties," the spokesman said.
He said that artillery fire "neutralised" LTTE mortar positions that
had been targetting the army advance.
Security forces Monday also killed five LTTE militants in an ambush in
eastern Sittandi region, officials said.
According to the military, the latest casualties brought to 647 the
total number killed since the army launched its offensive code-named
Rivirasa (Sunshine) in the Jaffna peninsula last Tuesday.
Of the total, 530 have died in the offensive with the remainder killed
in ethnic violence outside the peninsula, including an LTTE rocket
attack that devastated oil reserves in the capital.
Government forces have advanced at least three kilometers (two miles)
inside LTTE-held territory since launching the offensive from the main
Palaly military base located at the northern tip of the peninsula,
officials said.
However, the LTTE said in a statement from its London office that the
army advance in Jaffna peninsula was bogged down in the face of a
"ferocious counter-attack" by the guerrillas.
"The LTTE counter-attack has caused enormous casualties on the military
side. Exact figures are still not known. The fighting is continuing in
Atchchelu area (of the peninsula)," the LTTE statement said.
Military spokesman, Sarath Munasinghe denied the rebel claim and said
the army captured Atchchelu, a town eight kilometres (five miles) from
Jaffna, which the Tigers have vowed to defend to their last man.
The intensifed fighting between troops and the Tamil Tigers came as the
police accused the rebels of slaying six more Sinhalese civilians in
the island's southeast.
LTTE gunmen cut and beat the victims to death in the remote village of
Kotiyagala in the district of Monaragala, police said.
"The Tigers set fire to two shops and destroyed two houses. They have
killed six villagers in Kotiyagala and wounded seven others," a
spokesman for the nearby Monaragala police said.
Monday's massacre came just two days after the slaughter of 73
Sinhalese peasants in three villages across the island's eastern
region. The government blamed the attacks on the LTTE.
The military alleged that the LTTE was sowing terror among Sinhalese
peasants in a bid to blunt the Jaffna offensive by trying to force the
re-deployment of troops from the north to guard scores of vulnerable
villages in the east.
The military said that civilian massacres only hardened the resolve of
security forces to march into Jaffna town.
The LTTE is seeking to carve out an independent nation in the northern
and eastern regions called Eelam for Sri Lanka's two million minority
Tamils. More than 50,000 have been killed in the protracted ethnic war.
