French Open champion Thomas Muster won his 40th successive clay-court
match on Sunday after grabbing the title at the St Poelten Tennis

had an unexpected hard time to beat unseeded Bohdan Ulihrach of the
Czech Republic in three sets.
Muster took the first set easily with 6-3, but conceded the second 3-6.
He finally wrapped up the victory with 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 in the final.
Muster, ranked fourth in the world, has decided to skip Wimbledon
starting on Monday.
