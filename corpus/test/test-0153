Passengers Bravely Take Down Plane Showing Big Momma's House 2
The Federal Aviation Administration announced today that United Airlines
Flight 43, which crashed outside Parkersburg, WV last Thursday, was in fact
brought down by passengers who voluntarily sacrificed their lives in order
to prevent the screening of the in-flight movie selection, Big Momma's
House 2.
All 105 people onboard died in the crash.
"As we examine the passengers' cell-phone calls and  flight recordings,
we get a sense of the incredible courage displayed by these ordinary
men and women," said FAA Administrator Marion Blakey at a press
conference Monday, during which excerpts from the recordings were
played. "They acted in the only way they could to stop this unspeakable
horror starring Martin Lawrence as an FBI agent who goes undercover as
a nanny for a sexy murder suspect."
"These people are true American heroes," Blakey added.
Flight 43 left New York's LaGuardia Airport on schedule last Thursday
at 10:17 a.m. en route to Los Angeles with no indication of any
suspiciously bad entertainment activity aboard. Black-box evidence
indicates that, 40 minutes after takeoff, the crew walked through the
cabin and asked passengers to close their window screens. The audio
recording goes eerily quiet after a flight attendant can be heard
announcing that Big Momma's House 2 would be shown.
"It will be days, months perhaps, before we have a complete picture of
exactly what happened," said FAA crash investigator Matthew Roberts,
whose team was given the unpleasant job of analyzing Flight 43's last
moments. "But we know that the passengers somehow assembled toward the
rear of the cabin without attracting attention to themselves--which
couldn't have been easy, considering the tense silence that typically
accompanies a Big Momma's House film--and decided that they would
rather die than let anyone do this to them."
Around 11:00, business-class passenger Charles Rice left an emotional
message on the cell-phone voicemail of his fiancée, Kathi Kearney.
"Honey, it's me," Rice said in one of the excerpts. "I... God. Listen,
they've darkened the cabin, and they've started showing Big Momma's
House 2. The second one, I mean, and it... it's pretty bad. This might
not go well, honey. A bunch of us are going to try to stop them. I have
to go, we're going to go now. God, I am so sorry. You know I love you."
Although Roberts said they may never determine who acted first or how
the passengers organized their resistance to the brutally awful comedy,
it is believed that all onboard were united in their need to stop the
movie from being shown. In an amazing coincidence, at least one other
person aboard Flight 43 had actually survived a screening of the
original Big Momma's House on an international flight in 2001, which
may have given them impetus to act.
"It seems clear that, from the opening moments of the film, they knew
exactly how it had to end--either 99 minutes later as Martin Lawrence's
excruciating mugging brought it all to a heinous conclusion, or with
the deaths of everyone aboard," Roberts said. "We can only hope that we
would act with the same bravery and conscientiousness if presented with
the same situation."
Cabin recordings seem to indicate that a refreshment cart was used to
charge the attendant station at the front of the aircraft at a decisive
moment in the film in which a sexy potential villain asks Lawrence's
character for help removing her bra. Much of the recording is
incoherent, but Blakey played a 15-second segment in which some of the
flight attendants can be heard exhorting passengers to remain seated
while others seemed to be voicing second thoughts.
"Clearly, the passengers were facing well-trained hard-liners intent on
doing as much damage as they could," said Blakey, gesturing to the
charred, partially melted Big Momma's House 2 DVD case found in the
wreckage as evidence. "When they found the hospitality station locked
down and secured as per airline policy, the only choice they had left
was to infiltrate the cockpit."
One last garbled transmission was made from Flight 43 just before it
disappeared from air-traffic control's monitors. Though the FAA has not
released it publicly, Blakey confirmed that the passengers can be
clearly heard reciting the Lord's Prayer over the scream of the engines
and the high falsetto shriek of a female-impersonating Martin Lawrence.
Plans are already underway to honor the victims by presenting them with
the Presidential Medal Of Freedom, a $4 million memorial in the West
Virginia field where Flight 43 crashed, and a proposed Spring 2007
release of Flight 43, a big-budget action comedy-drama starring Chris
Tucker as Martin Lawrence.
