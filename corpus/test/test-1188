Macedonian parliament votes to change flag 
The Macedonian parliament voted Thursday to drop a disputed symbol from
its national flag as part of an agreement with Greece aimed at
normalizing relations between the Balkan neighbours.
Deputies voted by 110 votes to one, with four abstentions to modify the
former Yugoslav republic's emblem, removing a contested 16-pointed sun
symbol from the flag which had been at the heart of a four-year feud
between Skopje and Athens.
The parliamentary vote came as Macedonian television cited medical
sources as saying that President Kiro Gligorov, seriously injured
Tuesday in a carbomb attack, was in a slightly more comfortable
condition.
The television said Gligorov, 78, who required six hours of surgery to
remove shrapnel and two blood clots from his brain following the
attack, had passed a peaceful night and that doctors anticipated
advancing his treatment in consultation with foreign experts.
Another medical source, speaking under condition of anonymity, told AFP
that Gligorov was conscious and that none of his vital organs had been
affected.
"If everything goes well, the president should be able to leave the
hospital in a few weeks," the source said.
Gligorov, widely credited with holding the potentially explosive
Macedonian republic together as conflict spread across former
Yugoslavia, steered his country towards a UN-brokered agreement reached
with Greece last month, which required Skopje to change its flag and
constitution in return for Athens lifting an embargo against the
country.
Athens argued that both the ancient 16-pointed symbol -- the so-called
Sun of Vergina -- on the old flag and the name of Macedonia are part of
Greek history, and that Macedonia's use of both were tantamount to
territorial designs on the northern Greek province of the same name.
The overwhelming parliamentary approval Thursday removes the Sun of
Vergina symbol, introducing with immediate effect a new Macedonian flag
with a yellow orb on a red background.
The law is due to be ratified on Monday and talks between the two
neighbours will resume Tuesday ahead of the scheduled implementation on
October 14 of the interim agreement signed in New York on September 13.
Thereafter both sides will start to address the thorny issue of
Macedonia's name.
The parliament also used Thursday's session to condemn the attack
against Gligorov, which it called "a terrorist act aimed at getting rid
of the most prominent Macedonian personality working for peace and the
peaceful solution of disputes in the Balkans."
Greece stressed again Thursday that the attack would not affect the
interim agreement.
The bombing "will not influence the stability of the region nor
threaten" the former Yugoslav republic, Greek foreign ministry
spokesman Costas Bikas said.
Since the attack, Macedonian authorities have stepped up security
measures, particularly at the republic's borders with Greece and Serbia
and around the parliament and government buildings in Skopje.
Officials said Wednesday that police had questioned 150 people and
detained several, though no one had yet been arrested and no one has
claimed responsibility for the attack.
In London, the Home Office announced that Scotland Yard anti-terrorist
experts were heading to the Macedonian capital to assist Macedonian
authorities in probing the bomb attack.
Macedonian authorities asked Britain to assist in the probe, the
British government said, as Scotland Yard has a lot of experience in
investigating car bombs -- a method often used by the Irish Republican
Army during its campaign of violence against British rule in Northern
Ireland.
