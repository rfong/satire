Dole to crash Democrats' party in Chicago 
Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole will crash the Democrats'
party in Chicago, staging a campaign event on the eve of the August
26-29 gathering to nominate President Bill Clinton.
Dole spokeswoman Christina Martin said Friday that Dole will leave for
a weeklong vacation Sunday and will stop in Chicago, an unusual move
for an opposition candidate.
Clinton refused even to comment about the Republicans' convention in
San Diego last week saying he did not want to rain on their parade, but
his campaign staff set up camp near the convention hall to hold daily
briefings.
Dole's campaign, which likes surprises, would not say where Sunday's
event would be or what issue the former senate leader will address.
"That is yet to be announced," said Martin.
The three-time White House hopeful will travel from Illinois to the
northwest state of Oregon before heading south to Santa Barbara,
California, where he will spend his vacation in the hometown of former
president Ronald Reagan.
It is traditional for opponents to take a break from the campaign trail
during their rival's convention. Clinton and his family spent their
week off in the mountains of Wyoming.
On Friday Dole was campaigning in Georgia and Tennessee and on Saturday
he was to visit Florida and Louisiana, southern states considered key
in the November 5 elections.
Meanwhile, Clinton was preparing to announce approval for new
restrictions aimed at curbing tobacco sales, one of a number of popular
initiatiatives this week aimed at propelling him into the convention.
In a similar strategy, Dole narrowed Clinton's 20 point lead after he
unveiled a 15 percent tax cut and announced Jack Kemp as his vice
presidential running mate ahead of his nomination and is now some 11
points behind the president.
