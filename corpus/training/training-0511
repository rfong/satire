Albright to Visit Russia
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced today that she
would visit Russia next week to try to work out differences on a
proposed agreement between Russia and the Atlantic alliance.
Albright made the announcement when addressing the Senate Armed Service
Committee.
"I am going to be going to Moscow to have some additional meetings on
the subject, probably next week, because there are elements of the
agreement not decided upon," she said.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Moscow are
negotiating a document that will set up a future NATO-Russia
relationship.
