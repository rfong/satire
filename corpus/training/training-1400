S. Africa Warn Of Exchange Control Lifting 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned South Africa to go
slow on relaxing exchange controls, South Africa's Reserve Bank
Governor Chris Stals said.
Stals said people have found it hard to believe the IMF has advised
South Africa against a swift lifting.
The governor made the remark in his speech yesterday before key
policy-makers left for next month's IMF and World Bank annual general
meetings, the local daily "Business Day" reported.
South Africa began to relax exchange controls last year to attract
foreign investment.
The IMF, whose economic medicine normally means freeing markets,
changed its tack on exchange controls earlier this year.
Stals and Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg expected to discuss the
IMP's "likes and dislikes" on South Africa when they met IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus and other officials next month.
The main problems include the short-term nature of South Africa's
foreign capital inflows and lack of fixed investment by foreigners, the
snail's pace at which government's deficit is being reduced, the
minister said.
