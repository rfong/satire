Dollar trends down after Bundesbank rate decision 
The dollar got back on a downtrend Wednesday on the London foreign
exchange market after the German Bundesbank kept key interest rates
steady, even though the market had anticipated the decision.
The greenback stood in late afternoon at 1.3985 marks compared with
1.41 marks before the Bundesbank decision, which was announced at the
start of the noon-hour, and 1.4055 marks Tuesday evening in London.
Operators had not generally expected any reduction of the central
bank's key interest rates, but some had not ruled out a small cut in
the repo rate - which did not occur. It would have been aimed at
helping the German economy, which has been hurt by the mark's strength.
Keith Edmonds, an analyst at Industrial Bank of Japan, commented that
the market reacted badly to comments by Bundesbank officials that
seemed firmer than usual. Bank President Hans Tietmeyer noted the
difficulty of getting a correct view of the German economic situation
in view of a change in the way of calculating statistics - which now
take in the united country.
He said the situation should be clearer in September, which the market
took to rule out any rate cut in the meantime.
Edmonds said the dollar should now stabilize pending results of the
Group of Seven summit meeting starting on Thursday in Halifax, Canada.
Operators have continued to fear concerted central bank intervention
and hence have avoided large-scale dollar selling, said the analyst.
European currencies generally gained a bit against the masrk,
especially sterling, which benefited from the maintenance of the UK
inflation target of 1 to 4 percent a year, announced by the Treasury.
The lira firmed in what operators called a correction of the drop
caused early in the week by the results of Sunday's referendums in
Italy.
In late afternoon, the dollar was trading at 1.3985 marks (against
1.4055 Tuesday evening in London), 84.35 yen (84.30), 1.1535 Swiss
francs (1.1575), and 4.9050 French francs (4.9425).
Sterling stood at 1.6090 dollars (1.5953), 2.2502 marks (2.2421),
135.72 yen (134.48), 1.8560 Swiss francs (1.8465), and 7.8921 French
francs (7.8845).
Gold rose to 388.50 dollars an ounce against 387 on Tuesday.
The three-month Eurodollar dipped to 5.9375 percent compared with 6
percent, while the British three-month interbank rate was unchanged at
6.625 percent.
