British high commissioner to Harare placed under surveillance
The British high commissioner to Harare, Brian Donnelly, has been placed
under 24-hour surveillance for political activities incompatible with his
diplomatic status, state-run newspaper The Herald reported on Saturday.
The British Foreign Office immediately denied the allegations.
"Security agents have placed the British High Commissioner to Zitible
with his diplomatic duties," the paper said.
"Authoritative government sources said (to) the Herald that Mr Donnelly
was under open surveillance in the wake of revelations that he was
meddling in Zimbabwean politics.
"The high commissioner, said the sources, is also involved in
activities to undermine the legitimate government of President (Robert)
Mugabe," The Herald continued.
In London, the Foreign Office issued a statement declaring: "The
British High Commissioner is not involved, and has never been, in this
kind of activity."
"The allegations in the Zimbabawe press are baseless."
According to the newspaper, the decision to place Donnelly under
surveillance followed the arrest on June 3 of Sternford Moyo, t 48
hours under the country's new security law, accused of trying to
"subvert a constitutional government," according to polre civil rights.
Eleven journalists have also been arrested since President Robert
Mugabe's controversial re-election, which has been rejected by the
opposition, observers and western nations.
Britain, Zimbabwe's former ruler, is regularly accused by Mugabe's
government of interfering in the internal affairs of the southern
African country and supporting the opposition Movement for Democratic
Change (MDC).
Zimbabwe has also accused Britain of supporting white farmers whose
properties have been earmarked for compulsory acquisition by the
government in a bid to correct colonial land ownership imbalances.
