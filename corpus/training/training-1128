Shanghai Residents Purchase Suburban Housing 
Local consumers in Shanghai, the most populous and industrial
metropolis in China, are purchasing a growing number of houses and
apartments in suburban areas, according to local experts.
In the first two quarters of this year alone, sales of houses and
apartments in the outskirts of the Pudong New Area and the Xuhui,
Minhang and Jiading districts accounted for 85 percent and 75 percent
of the municipality's total housing sales.
The experts attributed the new trend to the improved transportation
conditions resulting from the completion of infrastructure such as
subways, bridges and other communication facilities built in recent
years, as well as relatively low housing prices in the area.
Moreover, new residential areas in Shanghai feature easy access to post
offices, schools, hospitals, shops and recreational facilities, as well
as an adequate green areas.
