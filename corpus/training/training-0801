Gansu Making Great Efforts in Afforestation 
The Gansu Corridor, northwest China, has witnessed good harvests in the
past two years, thanks to a decade-long tree-planting drive.
The corridor is situated in Gansu Province and part of the famous "Silk
Road", which played an important role in trade and interflow of culture
between China, Western Asia and Europe in ancient times. It has been
hit by its worst drought in the past 60 years.
Today a huge "green dragon" appeared in the region, and local
ecological conditions have improved and the barren lands are covered
with trees.
So far, the province has planted 330,000 hectares of forests to help
fix water and soil, with 240,000 ha. in the corridor as a windbreak,
which has protected 400,000 ha of farmland. Yesterday's "yellow dragon"
has turned into a large commodity grain producing base.
