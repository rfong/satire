Beijing Journalists Mourn Loss Of Colleagues In Embassy Attack 
More than 50 journalists from 20 news organizations and newspapers met
here today to mourn the loss of three journalists killed by the NATO
missile attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia last Friday.
A banner with the words "Strongly denounce the killing of Chinese
journalists by U.S.-led NATO attack" was hung across the front of the
meeting room and below it were flower arrangements with yellow
chrysanthemums and white silk containing elegiac couplets, from 550,000
journalists from across China.
Li Guo'An, the vice-president of the China Journalists Association,
said at the meeting that a dozen Chinese reporters have gone to the
front to cover Belgrade since NATO began the bombing in Yugoslavia a
month and a half ago. Their work in safeguarding justice and peace have
won the praise of Chinese and foreign readers, he said, and the killing
of the three journalists, Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying, was a
brutal infringement on Chinese sovereignty and a wanton trampling on
the basic norms of international relations and a gross violation of the
rights of journalists.
Other speakers included Zhang Baoshun, the deputy director of Xinhua
News Agency, Li Jingrui, the deputy editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily,
and people from People's Daily, Economic Daily, and China Central
Television.
Chinese People's University's journalism school also held a meeting
today to protest NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy. One student read
an open letter to foreign journalists in Beijing and a proposal to
students of journalist schools across China.
