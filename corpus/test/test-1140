Hong Kong's unemployment rate falls to its lowest in past months 
Unemployment in Hong Kong fell to a seasonally adjusted 2.9 percent in
the three months to July -- the lowest level in the past 14 months,
according to provisional figures released Monday.
The Census and Statistics Department attributed the drop to increased
hiring in the wholesale, retail, and import and export trades and
transport sectors, the Census and Statistics Department said.
The unemployment rates in the other major sectors remained generally
stable, the department said.
In the three months ending June 1996, total employment grew by 3.1
percent over a year earlier.
During the period April to June 1996, the number of unemployed people
who had previously held jobs was estimated at 86,200. Another 6,400
unemployed people were first time job seekers. The number of
underemployed people was estimated at 56,900.
