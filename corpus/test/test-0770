Skari secures World Cup title as Belmondo wins 30km event 
Olympic champion Bente Skari of Norway bagged the overall World Cup
cross country skiing women's title here Saturday, but it was Italy's
Stefania Belmondo who took the honours in the 30km freestyristina
Smigun with Italy's Gabriella Paruzzi at 28.6sec.
A 15th place finish was enough for 29-year-old Skari, winner of the
10km classic gold at the Winter Games last month, to secure the title
with 856 points.
The Norwegian has a 104 point advantage on her nearest challanger,
Czech racer Katerina Neumannova, who finished eighth here, but cannot
make up the ground in the final event of the season in Lillehammer,
Norway next Saturday.
