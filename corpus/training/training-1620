Liaoning Mobile Telecom Sector Reports Rapid Growth 
Official statistics show that the mobile telecommunications sector in
northeast China's Liaoning Province has expanded rapidly in recent
years.
The province has close to 1.43 million mobile phone subscribers and the
number continues to rise by some 60,000 subscribers monthly, according
to Zhai Ping, general manager of Liaoning Provincial Mobile Telecom Co.
Limited.
Zhai noted that Liaoning had a mere 622 mobile phone subscribers as
late as 1989. However, he went on to say the capacity of the province's
mobile telecom network currently approaches five million subscribers
and will increase by another 2. 26 million users by the end of this
year.
Shenyang, the provincial capital, alone has 440,000 mobile phone users,
or one mobile phone for every 10 local urban residents, said Zhai.
He added that the province's mobile telecom network will cover more
than 90 percent of Liaoning's urban population by the year 2000.
