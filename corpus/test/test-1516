Striking Polish miners occupy offices 
Striking coal miners Saturday occupied the offices at Tychy, southern
Poland, of the NSW group which operates eight coal mines, the Polish
news agency PAP reported citing union sources.
The miners, represented by the formerly communist PZZ union, were
making salary demands similar to those put forth during the past week
by colleagues belonging to the Solidarity labor federation.
On Friday Solidarity announced the launch of a protest movement on
Monday to hit all coal mines in Poland.
Stage one of the protest would block shipments of coal from mines
around Rybnik, also in the south.
Poland is currently in the grip of a severe cold wave, but most
administrative areas have coal reserves expected to last several weeks.
