eDrug-resistant pneumococcal infections increasing
The number of lung infections resistant to medical treatment is on the
rise in the United States, the Journal of the American Medical
Association reported Tuesday.
A study of 544 people with pulmonary infections, conducted from October
1991 to September 1992, showed that in 6.6 percent of the cases the
bacteria was resistant to penicillin.
The study, reported by Dr. Robert Breiman, a respiratory illness
specialist at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), showed that 16.4
percent were resistant to a number of drugs, including penicillin.
The figures were higher than those obtained in similar studies from
1979 to 1987, Breiman wrote. "Drug-resistant pneumococcal strains are
now far more prevalent," he said.
"Emergence of drug-resistant pneumococcal infections will present
critical challenges to clinicians for treating patients with
pneumococcal disease. Widened and intensified surveillance is needed,"
the doctor said.
Pulmonary infections are among the leading causes of death of young
children and the elderly. Approximately 40 percent of people over the
age of 65 who contract a lung infection die from it.
The authors of the study urged promotion and routine administration of
the currently available pneumococcal vaccine for high-risk patients.
