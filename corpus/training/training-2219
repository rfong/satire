Sino-Angolan Trade Ties Promoted 
Chairman of the Angolan-Chinese Friendship Association and Chamber of
Commerce, Adriano Junior, said today the bilateral trade has been
buttressed since the organization was set up a year ago.
Adriano told reporters here that the chamber, which was established in
August in 1995, has helped promote the direct trade between the two
countries.
Before that, the volume of the Sino-Angolan direct trade had been very
low and most of the Chinese products had been imported into Angola from
a third country.
Adriano said his organization also set up a computerized data bank on
Sino-Angolan trade for consultation of the Angolan businessmen.
Oil-rich Angola is China's third largest trade partner in Africa, and
the bilateral trade volume reached 60.87 million U.S. Dollars in 1994.
