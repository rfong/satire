E. Africa to Install Fibre Optic Transmission 
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda have finalized their plan for laying a
regional fibre optic transmission network to replace the existing
microwave system in a bid to improve inter-state transmission through
digitization of analog links.
The three east African nations will soon advertise a tender for the
56.8- million-U.S. dollar project, which is being under the auspices of
the East African Co-operation, the East African weekly reported Monday.
The fibre optic project, which will cover 2,500 kilometers, was
endorsed by the presidents of three countries on April 29, 1997, in
Arusha, a northern town in Tanzania.
The network will run from Mombasa to Nairobi in Kenya to Uganda via
Malaba, a border town in Kenya, with a branch to Mbale to Mbarara, both
cities in Uganda. There will also be a 500-kilometer fibre line between
Mombasa, a port city in eastern Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzanian
capital, running through Tanga, a city in Tanzania.
The European Investment Bank will provide 61.6 percent risk capital
while the East African Development Bank is to offer a commercial loan
to cover up to 13.5 percent of the cost.
The telecoms companies in three countries have to secure the remaining
25 percent funding from independent sources.
