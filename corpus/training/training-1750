Vice-Premier on Resettlement of Rural Residents in Three Gorges Area 
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said here today that more should be done to
resettle rural people living in the Three Gorges Dam area so that the
second-phase resettlement project goes smoothly and social order is
maintained.
Wu made the remark in a closing speech for a two-day meeting of the
relocation project, held in Chongqing Municipality, in southwest China.
He said that the relocation of the dam area's residents has gone well
so far. By June 30, some 178,000 residents had been resettled,
including 90,000 rural people.
The vice-premier pointed out that the central government has mapped out
favorable policies to support the resettlement, and the eleven
provinces and municipalities scheduled to take in 70,000 migrants from
Chongqing should take advantage of the chance to promote local economy.
He stressed that the eleven provinces and municipalities, mostly in
economically developed eastern and southern regions, should guide them
to develop the farming industry and make sure that the new migrants
could contract enough land for their crops.
