International police question for Brcko to be debated at Vienna Friday 
Deployment of an international police force in the disputed Bosnian
town of Brcko will be discussed at a meeting of key international
nations in Vienna on Friday, the senior international mediator in
Bosnia, High Representative Carl Bildt said on Wednesday.
There is speculation this week among diplomats that there is no
international will to operate a police force in the town, claimed by
both Serbs and Moslems.
Last month an arbitration panel set up in November 1995 as part of the
Dayton peace agreement deferred a final decision on competing claims
for the town from Moslems and Serbs.
The panel said there would be a further year, during which the Croat
and Moslem refugees who fled the Serb-held town during the war had the
right to return.
Many refugees say they are frightened of returning to Brcko while their
former Serb enemies still control the police.
"The police issue is very important," said Bildt's spokesman Colum
Murphy. "There has been some debate between different schools of
thought about how the policing issue should be dealt with....we hope
that a consensus is emerging that will produce agreement."
"The aim of the meeting in Vienna is to mobilise the international
resources necesary in order to support the implementation of what was
agreed on Brcko," he added.
