Unemployment Slightly Up in EU Countries 
The rate of unemployment in the European Union went slightly up in
August as compared with a month earlier, today's issue of the European
Report said.
The rate was up by 0.1 percentage point from an average 10.6 percent in
all EU member states.
Spain, Finland, France and Ireland bore the brunt of unemployment all
with double-digit rates at 19.8 percent, 12.6 percent, 12.6 percent and
10.7 percent respectively.
Though Germany reported earlier this month that its unemployment rate
was at a post-war record high of 11.7 percent, the European Report held
the German rate at 9.8 percent.
Luxembourg has the lowest unemployment rate at 3.8 percent among the 15
EU countries.
The number of people out of work in key member countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is on the
rise again, according to the bi-weekly report.
The average OECD-area unemployment rate was 7.3 percent, or 0.1
percentage point higher than the rate recorded in July.
It rose from 4.8 percent to 4.9 percent in the United States.
