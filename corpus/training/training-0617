US military team on alert for Liberia evacuation assessment 
A 10-member US military team was on alert Monday, awaiting orders to
fly into Liberia to assess possible evacuation of US nationals amid
fighting in the capital, the Pentagon said.
White House spokesman Michael McCurry said, however, that no decision
had yet been taken on a possible evacuation of the 450 US citizens in
Liberia.
A decision on whether to order an evacuation resides with the US
ambassador and the State Department, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Mike
Wood said.
"An assessment team is on alert," he said, adding that its task would
be to check out the situation and determine what would be required in
the event of an evacuation.
He said they would be looking at possible exit routes for about 500
people. The closest airport that could be used for an evacuation is
about a one to two hour helicopter ride away in Sierra Leone, he said.
The 10-member US Army team was attached to the US European Command in
Heidelberg, Germany, he said.
Lebanon asked the United States over the weekend to evacuate Lebanese
nationals caught in the crossfire, according to the Lebanese Foreign
Affairs Ministry.
The worst fighting in four years erupted in Monrovia over the weekend
when armed police attacked the residence of Roosevelt Johnson, the
ousted leader of the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J), who is
wanted for murder.
The White House was "very concerned" about the fighting, said McCurry,
adding that it formed "a direct threat to the peace process."
He said diplomatic contacts were initiated with countries that
participate in the West African peacekeeping force in Liberia.
