European court rejects French appeal against BA purchase
The European Court of Justice on Thursday rejected an attempt by Air
France to overturn the purchase by British Airways of a 49.9 percent
share of the French regional airline TAT.
The French national carrier had appealed against a decision by the
European Union's executive European Commission in November 1992 to
allow the purchase on the grounds that it did not infringe EU
competition regulations.
Air France complained that the commission had allowed British Airways
more leeway than granted to the French carrier and other airlines.
But the court rejected the French argument that the TAT takeover
comprised a distortion of competition on the London-Paris route.
Earlier in the decade, the commission had ordered Air France to modify
the conditions of its take-overs in the early 1990's of the French
airlines Air Inter and UTA, and a 37.5 percent share of the Belgian
carrier Sabena.
One condition was that Air France give up its interests in TAT.
The former president of Air France, Bernard Attali, had claimed that
the commission was not applying the same strict standards to British
Airways.
TAT was at the centre last week of another showdown between the French
government and British Airways.
Paris had contested a European Commission order that TAT, now owned by
British Airways, should along with Air UK and its new mother company
have the right to run a service between London and Orly Airport as part
of the EU's airline deregulation policy.
Last March, the European Court of Justice also rejected an attempt by
Air France to overturn the purchase by British Airways of the domestic
British carrier Dan Air.
