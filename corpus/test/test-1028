WHO Calls for Regulation of Tobacco Products 
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday called on international
food and drug regulators to bring cigarettes and other tobacco products
under the same ambit of rules that govern the sales and promotion of
other nicotine delivery devices.
Gro Harlem Brundtland, director general of WHO, made the remark at the
opening ceremony of the ninth International Conference of Drug
Regulatory Authorities (ICDRA) in Berlin.
Brundtland said, "a cigarette is a euphemism for a cleverly crafted
product that delivers just the right amount of nicotine to keep its
user addicted for life before killing the person."
This is the first time for the world's premier health agency to urge
food and drug regulators to rationalize rules that govern all forms of
nicotine consumption.
"The tobacco companies will inevitably tell you they are selling a
simple agricultural product, chopped up tobacco leaves rolled into a
paper tube," said Brundtland, adding, "this is categorically untrue."
Tobacco control experts say it does not stand to reason that harmful
nicotine from cigarettes is available freely while prescriptions are
necessary for therapeutic nicotine sold by pharmaceuticals.
According to WHO, in 1890, tobacco was included in the United States
Pharmacopia but, after intense lobbying of Congress by tobacco
manufacturers, it was excluded from the purview of the US Food and Drug
Administration, which has jurisdiction over those products listed in
Pharmacopia.
Demanding that the omission to be rectified, Brundtland said that the
organization would soon convene a high-level meeting of international
regulators to assess the extent to which the tobacco industry had
subverted science and used false advertising and promotional tactics to
veil nicotine addiction as an act of free choice.
Tobacco has reportedly killed 4 million people, over 70 percent of them
in the developing world.
In the first quarter of the next century, tobacco industry products
will kill 10 million people, many of them in the prime of their lives.
