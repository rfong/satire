NATO bombs cut off Pale telephone links, agency says 
NATO planes bombed a communications centre in Majevica, eastern Bosnia,
breaking off telephone links in the area that includes the main Bosnian
Serb town of Pale, the independent agency Beta said.
It had become impossible to telephone Pale from Belgrade, and radio and
television broadcasting has also been affected, following the raids
over the eastern sector of the self-declared Serb Republic, the agency
added.
The FoNet agency also reported that humanitarian aid convoys had been
been suspended for security reasons, following the resumption of raids.
NATO Tuesday relaunched raids against Bosnian Serbs, accused of failing
to meet United Nations demands, notably concerning the withdrawal of
heavy weapons from an exclusion zone around Sarajevo.
