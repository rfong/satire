Bodies of Two Missing Nicaraguan Sailors Found 
The bodies of two Nicaraguan naval servicemen who had disappeared in
the Pacific Ocean on March 7 were spotted Friday, one week after the
shipwreck, military sources said today.
The other four bodies, already located in the sea, are expected to be
recovered today.
The six crew members of the Nicaraguan Navy's Rapid Boat No. 004
disappeared when they were ordered to assist a Nicaraguan boat. The
Nicaraguan boat was detained by the Salvadoran Naval Force in the Gulf
of Fonseca shared by Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador.
Naval investigations indicated that the incident was caused by boat
engine problems and high waves.
