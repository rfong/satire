Supreme Court Gets Free Box Of Shoes After Mentioning Nike In Ruling
WASHINGTON, DC--The nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court were
treated to a free crate of athletic shoes Monday, following an offhand
mention of Nike during a ruling in the case of McBrayer & Company v.
The City Of Detroit. "All I did was say that the claims made by the
defendant were similar to those made by Nike when defending labor
conditions in its Asian footwear factories," Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg said. "Next thing you know, we get this big box of red Air
Zoom Spiridons in the mail. Inside the box was a form letter from
Nike's publicist. Sweet!" The Supreme Court will begin its new session
Oct. 6, with Case 03-130: Sony High-Definition Widescreen Televisions
v. Fossil Sterling Silver Multifunction Watches v. Bombay Sapphire Gin.
