Niles' leaning tower gets facelift to attract tourists by Gerard Aziakou 
Its tilting structure looms incongruously between the local YMCA and a
Ford dealership off a busy thoroughfare in this northern Chicago
suburb.
The leaning tower of Niles, a half-sized replica of the Italian
original in Pisa, is being spruced up for the Christmas holiday after
months of renovation and landscaping work estimated at around one
million dollars.
Every night, the 97-foot-high (33-meter) tower's balconied structure is
aglow with strings of colorful lights and decked out with Christmas
wreaths.
Although the restoration is virtually completed, authorities said they
are delaying the official grand reopening until the spring when warm
weather returns.
By then they hope that the refurbished tower will become more than just
a roadside curiosity, luring tourists and once again becoming the focal
point of this community of 30,000 people.
The renovation, prompted by damage from marauding pigeons, has involved
regrouting, repair of steps and installation of new columns, windows as
well as light and plumbing fixtures.
A 30-foot reflecting pool, four arched water fountains, a plaza area, a
spotlight system to illuminate the tower and a leaning phone booth have
been added.
"It's our most famous landmark and we hope it will become a meeting
point where people come to take wedding pictures," said Ghida
martorano, an assistant to Niles village manager Abe Selman.
Built in 1934 to conceal a water tower, Niles' Leaning tower is
structurally sound, unlike its 12th century counterpart in Tuscany
which over the years has been subjected to a variety of engineering
experiments to stop its growing tilt.
The Niles structure is built of concrete with a five-foot (1.5 meter)
foundation and sturdy walls while the Pisa equivalent is a white marble
marvel erected on sand.
Pisa and Niles have in fact been sister cities since 1990.
Officials at the nearby Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), which
owns the tower and leases it to the village of Niles for one dollar a
year, acknowledge that theirs doesn't have the same drawing power as
the original.
"But we do get some foreign visitors during the summer," said Rob
Molineaux, the YMCA's youth director. "My mother had a visitor from
Italy a few years ago who drove by to check it out and said it was
leaning the wrong way."
Robert Ilg, the eccentric inventor of the self-cooling propeller, built
the Niles replica 62 years ago and dedicated to Galileo with the hope
that it would inspire young visitors to explore the wonders of science.
Ilg, who died in 1964, bequeathed the tower and the land around it to
the YMCA on condition that it remains standing until the year 2059,
with an average of 500 dollars a year spent on upkeep, or the land
beneath it would go to his heirs.
