Maoists bomb airport tower disrupting Nepal flights 
Maoist rebels Friday bombed a civil aviation tower disrupting domestic
flights amid a series of bomb attacks across the country, police said.
"The Maoist terrorists bombed the civil aviation tower at the Bhojpur
airport Friday morning which badly damaged it but there was no
immediate report of any casualties," a police spokesman said.
Flights between Kathmandu and Bhojpur, 260 kilometres (161 miles) east
of the capital, were cancelled and other flights were disrupted.
The guerrillas also bombed an electricity sub-station in the southern
Chitwan district on Thursday night disrupting power supply in the
district, police said.
A government office in Dhangadhi, 460 kilometres (287 miles) southwest
of Kathmandu, and the nearby home of an MP of the ruling Nepali
Congress party, Sunil Kumar Bhandari were also damaged in a bomb blast
Thursday.
Meanwhile the home of another Nepali Congress activist in the
southeastern Morang District was also targetted in a bomb attack which
caused extensive damage, police said.
Home Minister Khum Bhadadur Khadka said the Maoists were particularly
targetting Nepali Congress activists and leaders.
Meanwhile nine Maoists were killed by security forces, the defence
ministry said.
"At least nine Maoist rebels were killed in an encounter with security
forces in different parts of the kingdom on Thursday," a defence
ministry statement said.
Two civilians, including a woman, were also killed in Maoist-related
violence, it said without giving details.
Nearly 3,000 people have been killed since the rebels launched their
violent struggle for a communist republic in 1996.
The country has been under a state of emergency since November to allow
the army to fight the Maoists.
