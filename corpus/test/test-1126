Japanese shoppers put Paris tops
Japanese tourists in Europe pick Paris for their biggest spending
sprees, disbursing a large part of their savings on French luxury
goods.
Women make up 60 percent of the million Japanese visitors who finish
their European sojourns here. Many are single secretaries between 20
and 30, known as the OL (office ladies). There are also married women
in groups of two or three.
This year's Japanese arrivals, wielding formidable purchasing power,
are increasingly coming as individuals and not just in the mass groups
organised in previous years.
On past performance, their spending of not less than 10 billion francs
(two billion dollars) accounts for almost eight percent of the outlay
of the 60 million tourists France hosts each year.
At the chamber of commerce and industry here, an official of the
Franco-Japanese business sector noted that the purchases were not all
the work of particularly well-off visitors, but were often made from
patiently accumulated savings. Moreover, they were shopping with much
more discernment than was the case half a dozen years back, he added.
Still among the flashy spenders, however, were the young newly-weds,
about 150,000 of them altogether in a year, honeymooning in Europe.
Those who made it to Paris would on average splash out some 800,000 yen
(8,700 dollars).
An additional advantage and attraction that Paris possesses for the
Japanese is that there are stores staffed by fellow Japanese.
The Paris branch of Mitsukoshi has a plum site on the Boulevard des
Capucines right next to the Opera. Its four floors of 2,100 square
metres (22,600 square feet) stock the whole range of French de luxe
wares, backed by solid guarantees of authenticity that the smaller
French-Japanese outlets in the same part of town cannot match.
At Mitsukoshi, with its 100-strong staff and 250 million francs
turnover, Japanese customers can, in their own language, buy all the
most renowned "made in France" produce. The only exceptions are
Guerlain perfumes, Louis Vuitton luggage and Hermes scarves, which are
sold exclusively in their own stores.
Offers range from key rings to Emile Galle ceramics and glassware of
last century, with prices climbing from 22,000 francs to 200,000 francs
(4,450 dollars to 40,485 dollars), while a bottle of finest Romanee
Conti from Burgundy costs 8,000 francs (1,620 dollars).
