Girls Under 16 Give Birth To 390 Babies Daily In Kenya 
A Kenya Family Planning Association (FPAK) official has urged the
government to introduce family life education programs in schools to
reduce girls' early pregnancy.
FPAK Program Manager Margaret Thuo was speaking during the launch of a
community-based distribution of contraceptives scheme in Bahati
Division, Nakuru district, on Sunday.
She said 700 school girls under 19 abort daily in Kenya at present, due
to a lack of family life knowledge.
Thuo said the number will increase if family life education programs
are not introduced in schools.
The FPAK official said girls aged between 15 and 16 give birth to 390
babies daily.
"This trend can be changed if the girls are taught about their bodies
instead of waiting for them to learn out of curiosity," she said.
