Lebanese minister of interior criticizes human rights groups 
Lebanese Interior Minister Michel Murr on Wednesday criticized human
rights groups which he accused of "paralyzing" the task of security
forces in the country.
Murr, in published remarks, said he will "investigate Lebanese branches
of such groups who do not aim at defending human rights, but at
paralyzing the task of security forces and the state security policy."
Murr said his Arab counterparts had expressed similar concerns during
their meetings that ended Sunday in Tunis. He said the participants
decided to "engage in bilateral contacts with Western countries to
withdraw their backing to such groups and refrain from hearing their
allegations."
According to Murr, Lebanon recently received 200 messages from rights
groups in Germany, Britain, France and the United States "following
false information on human rights violations in Lebanon."
In December, Lebanese security forces launched a wave of arrests among
Christian opposition ranks after an attack north of Beirut that killed
a Syrian civilian and following the distribution of anti-Syrian tracts
in Lebanon.
Among those arrested was a member of a human rights group and a
journalist with the independent An Nahar newspaper. They have all been
released since.
Several international organizations, including the London-based Amnesty
International, denounced the arrests as illegal.
