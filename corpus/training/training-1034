Human Rights Records in United States (24)
The plight of children in the U.S. is not entirely gratifying. The
country has the highest proportion of children who die from shooting
incidents among the 26 richest countries in the world, with more than
7,000 children killed by gunshot wounds each year.
A study by the Washington-based Children's Defence Fund released in
March of 1997 said that one person below the age of 20 is killed by a
gun every ninety minutes and children below the age of 15 die are 12
times more likely to be killed by a gun than in 25 other industrialized
countries combined.
Child abuse is a serious problem in the U.S. Every ten seconds a child
is either abused or suffering from neglect, and each year, about
130,000 children suffer from sexual abuse, 2,000 children die from
abuse, and 250,000 are physically attacked.
A government survey report released on January 11 showed that the
number of children suffering from abuse or neglect increased from 1.4
million in 1986 to more than 3 million in 1997. Each year, 1,046
children die from maltreatment and lack of proper care and the younger
the child is the more susceptible to physical abuse it is. About 82
percent of the children killed are below the age of five, and nearly 44
percent are one or younger (28).
