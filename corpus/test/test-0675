Natural Gas Pipeline Study Agreement signed 
The China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the Exxon Corporation
of the US and the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan signed a study
agreement here today for a long-distance natural gas pipeline from
Turkmenistan via Kazakhstan and China to Japan and other regions.
If economic analyses support the project's viability, the main portion
of this pipeline will extend over 6,000 km onshore and about 2,000 km
offshore, and reach Japan possibly via the Republic of Korea, said
Zhang Yongyi, vice-president of the CNPC.
Since late 1992, with the support of the Turkmenistan government,
Mitsubishi and the CNPC have been actively conducting a preliminary
study of the technical viability of this concept.
Exxon will take the study to a more detailed stage, Zhang said.
Included within the scope of this study will be the pipeline route and
costs, identification of natural gas resources available to support the
project, target markets for the gas, associated volume requirements and
timing, among others.
The pipeline is expected to be among the largest in the world in terms
of transportation capacity, he said.
