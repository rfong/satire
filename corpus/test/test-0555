Businessman claims he was paid to kill ANC officials 
A Pretoria businessman said Thursday the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom
Party (IFP) paid him to have two senior members of President Nelson
Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) killed before all-race
elections in April.
Riaan van Rensburg, who owns a "corporate image-building and training
company," told a press conference here that he had set up a secret
military training camp for IFP members and was "requested" by a ranking
IFP official to arrange "to have certain ANC leaders ... eliminated
from society."
Politicians singled out for assassination included ANC KwaZulu-Natal
Midlands chairman Harry Gwala and provincial leader Jacob Zuma, he
said.
"This I understood to be a direct order to have these people killed,"
Van Rensburg said.
A training course costing more than one million rand (285,000 dollars)
for 60 IFP members began in September 1993 at a secret camp in
KwaZulu-Natal, Van Rensburg said, but he abruptly halted training when
received only half of his promised fee of 690,000 rands (197,000
dollars).
"But I don't think I would have killed them anyway," said Van Rensburg,
who acknowledges links with white extremists. "You have to draw the
line somewhere."
Van Rensburg's claims came as Justice Minister Dullah Omar said on
Thursday that he was determined to push ahead with a Truth Commission
to probe South Africa's apartheid-era crimes, despite opposition from
the IFP and the former ruling National Party.
The commission, which is likely to be set up early next year, aims to
investigate politically motivated crimes committed by all parties,
including the ANC, during the 46 years of apartheid rule that ended
with the first all-race elections in April.
Van Rensburg said he had applied for indemnity from prosecution in
return for testimony before the Truth Commission.
"They haven't promised it to me, but I am pretty certain I will get
indemnity," he said.
He said was asked in July 1993 by IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who
is now Home Affairs minister in Mandela's government, to train IFP
members to counter perceived threats by ANC supporters in
KwaZulu-Natal.
Senior members of the IFP central committee, including Walter Felgate,
a hardliner close to Buthelezi, were appointed to head the project, he
said.
Felgate has acknowledged that the IFP used Van Rensburg to carry out
"special training," but has denied the assassination orders.
Van Rensburg said he would air his allegations next week before a
special government task force investigating the activities of political
hit squads.
At least 6,000 people were killed in political violence from the
beginning of last year until the election, most of them in clashes
between the ANC and the IFP in KwaZulu-Natal and the townships
surrounding Johannesburg.
