Zanzibar Crisis Causes Depreciation of Tanzanian Shilling 
The political crisis, which has been puzzling Tanzania's
semi-autonomous Zanzibar after general elections last October, has
caused Tanzanian shilling to depreciate, Minister for Finance Basil
Mramba said on Monday.
Speaking at the National Assembly in central town of Dodoma, Mramba
said that although Tanzania succeeded to bring down inflation to 5.1
per cent by March, the rate is still too high compared with other
countries.
The crisis in Zanzibar between the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party and
the main opposition Civic United Front over the elections has led to
some 30 deaths.
"This also affected the value of the shilling," he said, adding that
the Bank of Tanzania (central bank) is taking actions to boost the
economy and make the changes of the currency's value in a bid to tally
with economic fundamentals.
The Tanzanian shilling has come under intense pressure against the U.S.
dollar, depreciating from about 800 in early March to 890 in late June
this year.
Experts were quoted as saying that unless the Bank of Tanzania
intervenes in the market, the shilling will continue its slide.
They believed that the shilling has been overvalued for some time and
the depreciation is a market correction.
Depreciation of the shilling helps Tanzanian exporters, but is a major
blow to importers.
The depreciation could also have a negative impact on inflation figures
for the second and third quarter of this year, experts predicted.
