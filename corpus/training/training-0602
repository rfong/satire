Japan protests against US probe into research whaling 
Japan on Wednesday formally protested against a US investigation into
Japanese research whaling that Washington has said could lead to trade
sanctions against Japan, Kyodo News Service said.
Kyodo quoted government officials as saying the protest had been made
in a letter sent by the fisheries agency to the US Commerce Department.
The letter argues that research whaling conducted by Japan is
legitimate under an agreement of the International Whaling Commission
(IWC), the officials said.
In Washington on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Commerce Department's
National Marine Fisheries Service hinted that President Bill Clinton
could impose sanctions against Japan following the department's
investigation.
The Japanese officials, however, said there was little possibility that
sanctions would be invoked against Japan, citing a similar case
involving Norway in which Washington had not taken punitive action,
Kyodo said.
Defying an IWC resolution in June calling for a halt to research
whaling in the Antarctic Ocean, Japan plans to continue research
whaling this year with a target of 400 minke whales, 100 more than last
year's haul.
