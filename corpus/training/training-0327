Hunger Kills Over 20 People Daily in Central Angolan Town 
Over 20 people, including children and women, die everyday in the town
of Camacupa in Bie Province in central Angola due to hunger,
malnutrition and fatal diseases, Angola's official television TPA
reported here on Thursday.
However, more and more newly-displaced persons are still arriving in
Camacupa, some 80 kilometers northeast to the provincial capital Kuito,
from the neighboring district of Cuemba, where battles between the
Angolan government troops and the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola rebels are underway.
Images offered by the TPA show that women and children in Camacupa seem
weak and desperate.
Luis Paulino dos Santos, Governor of Bie Province, has appealed to all
non-governmental organizations in Camacupa to provide urgent
humanitarian assistance to the sufferers, according to the TPA report.
