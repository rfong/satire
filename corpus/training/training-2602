Texas Death Penalty Dismay
Texas is reeling at news that the death penalty is facing the possibility
of being declared unconstitutional. With evidence mounting that the Supreme
Court has noticed that Texas executes 4 times as many as other states,
informed sources say they are starting to consider the death penalty to be
solely a Texas punishment.  This could lead them to conclude that execution
is unusual punishment in violation of the 8th amendment.
Groans of shock and dismay were recorded across the Lone Star State as
Texans started to come to terms with the news their beloved executions
might be taken away.
"This all started with the abolition of execution for the retarded"
said Dwight Johnson of Harris County, "that dang Yankee Supreme Court
should stay out of our business".
Death row prison guards concerned for their jobs have decided to take
action. Spokesman Jim Austen stated the guards union was going to start
a grassroots nationwide campaign to encourage other states to have more
executions.
Arguing that the death penalty is a time honoured tradition he was
quick to point out that "the death penalty is like free speech - use it
or lose it".
The Mayor of Houston, a city that by itself executes more than 51 of
the 52 States, is particularly concerned that mass layoffs could follow
in the prosecutors' office and he has weighed in his support for the
guards union. "We love the Yellow Rose of Texas and we love the Death
Rows of Texas", he said in an impassioned plea for support from other
city mayors nationwide.
Trade War looms
Shares of chemical companies who specialize in the manufacture of
Sodium Piothental are also under threat unless they can break into the
burgeoning but restricted Chinese death penalty market. The US is
expected to bring the matter up in upcoming WTO talks.
