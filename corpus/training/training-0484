Prime Minister Tony Blair at which public smiles will mask private
differences over missile defense and global warming. Financial Times:
-- Unemployment and earnings growth both fell last month, official
figures showed, presenting an encouraging picture of the state of the
labor market. The count of people claiming unemployment benefits fell
12,000 to 963,700 in June, its lowest level since October 1975. Most
forecasters now expect rates to be left unchanged until the end of the
year. The Independent: -- Dozens of babies died unnecessarily at
Bristol Royal Infirmary because of a "club culture" among surgeons, who
adopted a paternalistic attitude to patients and wielded too much

percent of London's 1.5 million children were living in households with
incomes below half the national average. The Times: -- British
