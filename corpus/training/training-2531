UNHCR plans cut in aid for Afghan refugees in Pakistan 
The United Nations refugee care agency said Sunday it planned to scale
down the aid programme for Afghan refugees, but vowed it would not
leave Pakistan alone to shoulder the burden.
A redesigned programme "must be in place not later than the beginning
of 1996," the local office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
said in a statement.
The new strategy would "entail a phase-down of the total amount of
assistance provided and of staff needed to implement it," the statement
said.
Explaining the reasons, UNHCR said the "great majority" of some one
million Afghans still in Pakistan had achieved "self-sufficiency."
They "are no longer in need of the large scale and open-ended care and
maintenance assistance which has been provided to them for one and a
half decades," the statement said.
Noting the "explosion" of humanitarian needs in Africa and the
continuing strife in the former Yugoslavia, it said the resources of
donor governments for humanitarian aid "are increasingly stretched to
the limit."
But the statement dispelled speculation in the local press that the
UNHCR assistance could be stopped.
"UNHCR will not abandon the government of Pakistan in providing aid to
those vulnerable groups of Afghan refugees who remain truly in need and
where such needs cannot be met by themselves or from other national and
international sources," it said.
The new programme is being discussed in detail with the Pakistan
government, the statement added.
The agency has provided more than a billion dollars in aid to Afghan
refugees in Pakistan since 1979, when the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan drove several millions into Pakistan and Iran.
After the takeover of Kabul by Afghan mujahedeen in 1992, some 1.5
million Afghans voluntarily returned to their homeland.
