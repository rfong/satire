The/DT plan/NN to/TO separate/VB the/DT more/RBR profitable/JJ gas/NN exploration/NN and/CC production/NN sector/NN is/VBZ an/DT attempt/NN to/TO protect/VB British/NNP Gas/NNP from/IN potential/JJ losses/NNS of/IN 1.5/CD billion/CD pounds/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 2.2/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- from/IN contracts/NNS amounting/VBG to/TO 40/CD billion/CD pounds/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 60/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- to/TO purchase/NN surplus/NN North/NNP Sea/NNP gas/NN ./.
