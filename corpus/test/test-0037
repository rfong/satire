Owen proud to be named England captain
Liverpool striker Michael Owen said Tuesday it was a "great honour" to be
named England captain by coach Sven Goran Eriksson in the absence of
injured skipper David Beckham.
Owen, 22, will become the youngest England captain since 1966 World Cup
winner Bobby Moore when he wears the armband in Wednesday's friendly
international against Paraguay at Anfield.
"It's obviously a great honour to be named captain," Owen said. "When
the manager told me I was straight on the phone to mum and dad and
friends and family.
"It was a complete surprise. People had been naming a few that could
get it but it was a surprise and a pleasant one. (Being at Anfield)
completes it all, in front of your home fans on the pitch you know
best.
"It's something I've always dreamed of, to get it at 22 is sooner than
I imagined. It's going to be a great occasion."
Owen replaces Beckham who broke a bone in his foot during last week's
Champions League quarter-final, second leg tie against Deportivo La
Coruna of Spain.
The Manchester United midfielder faces a race against the clock to be
fit in time for England's opening World Cup match against Sweden in
Saitama, Japan on June 2.
A proud Owen welcomed the responsibility but said he was not sure how
long he would hold onto the captaincy.
"Everyone knows David is the captain and we have Rio (Ferdinand) and
Sol (Campbell) and they are big candidates," he said.
"I am not expecting to be captain during the World Cup - I would jump
at the chance - but there are plenty of others who are up to the job."
Asked how much captaincy experience he had, Owen joked: "Five minutes!
"Paul Ince and Steve McManaman were captain and vice-captain (for
Liverpool) away to Valencia (in the UEFA Cup) and both got sent off in
the last five minutes so I sprinted across to the touchline to get the
armband."
Eriksson was in no doubt that Owen was the right man for the job.
"He was the best footballer in Europe last year and I think he's a very
clean and popular one inside and outside England," said the England
coach.
"It's up to him to show that he's also a leader and I think he is.
"Michael Owen will be captain for the game tomorrow and then we'll see
when David Beckham is back. Hopefully it will be for one game, because
that means that Beckham is back.
"If Beckham is not back for the World Cup, which could happen, then I
will think about it and see what we're going to do, if it's Michael or
someone else in the squad."
Eriksson said there had been no further injury worries and everyone in
the squad would be taking part in training on Tuesday afternoon.
He added that Paraguay's Italian coach Cesare Maldini had agreed to
allow five or six substitutions in the game, and he would be contacting
him later Tuesday to see if more would be possible.
The England coach had been hoping to play his strongest team at some
stage on Wednesday but injuries to several players have not enabled him
to do so.
"Unfortunately we have some important injuries but I think if you talk
about Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand and Emile Heskey, they
are short-term and will be back very soon," Eriksson said.
"It's not perfect to not be able in March or April to play your best
team but I look forward to the game tomorrow and even more going to
Dubai and starting the real preparation with the team and the squad and
we can focus on the World Cup.
"We have already been unlucky so I hope we will avoid any more
injuries. The players are tired and many clubs have important games to
play, they are still fighting for something so that means tough games
and a lot of stress."
