Strong Chinese currency eating away at trade surplus 
The continuing appreciation of the Chinese yuan against the dollar is
taking its toll on the country's foreign trade surplus, although
foreign currency reserves remain at a record high, a report said
Sunday.
Since the unification of China's dual exchange rate system at the
beginning of 1994, when the yuan was set at 8.7 to the dollar, the
Chinese currency has appreciated steadily -- especially following the
creation of an inter-bank foreign exchange market in April.
The dollar's weakness saw the yuan trading at 8.44 at the beginning of
this year, and the current swap rate is averaging 8.3 yuan.
"The toll a strong yuan has taken on China's foreign trade has turned
increasingly visible", the China Daily Business Weekly warned, citing a
slowdown in export growth.
Year-on-year export increases have fallen from 88.2 percent in December
to 49.1 percent in May, while import growth has remained relatively
constant at around 15 percent.
While domestic inflation and reduced rates for export tax refunds have
also been factors, experts here put most of the blame for the slowdown
on the appreciation of the yuan.
China's trade surplus stood at 10.26 billion dollars by the end of May,
almost double the figure for the whole of 1994, when China transformed
a previous 12.2 billion dollar trade deficit into a 5.3 billion dollar
surplus.
Many foreign bankers say the yuan is currently over-valued by as much
as 15 percent, largely because of the greenback's weakness, and some
have predicted a depreciation of the local currency over the long-term.
A healthy trade surplus is important for China this year, as a 30
percent plunge in pledged foreign investment in 1994 will begin to make
itself felt in the latter half of 1995.
In addition, China's tight domestic credit situation and high inflation
are likely to depress investment and consumption, making the trade
surplus an "essential contributor" to national economic growth, the
China Daily said.
China's foreign-exchange reserves stood at 60 billion dollars in June,
up from 51 billion dollars at the end of last year.
However, the newspaper quoted experts who warned against complacency,
saying that a "huge" hard currency reserve was necessary to ensure debt
repayment and to ensure the financial stability of Hong Kong when it
returns to Chinese soverignty in 1997.
