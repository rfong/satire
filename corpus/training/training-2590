Banned Chiapucci Hopes to Take Part in Tour of Italy 
Claudio Chiappucci, currently suspended after failing a blood test, is
hoping to take part in the Tour of Italy to start Saturday, reports
said.
The Italian was banned for two weeks last Thursday after blood tests
revealed unusually high haemoglobin levels.
Chiappucci, twice a runner-up in both the Tour of Italy and the Tour de
France, returned a 51 percent level of red blood cell levels in excess
of the 50 percent limit set by the International Cycling Union (UCI),
cycling's ruling body.
However, he argued that he should be allowed to start the Giro when he
appeared before the anti-doping commission of the Italian Olympic
Committee on Wednesday.
