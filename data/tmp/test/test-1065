Portuguese-Speaking/JJ African/NNP Countries/NNPS Embrace/NNP New/NNP Era/NNP At/IN the/DT turn/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ millennium/NN ,/, the/DT Portuguese-speaking/JJ African/JJ countries/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- PALOP/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, arising/VBG from/IN decades/NNS of/IN devastating/JJ conflicts/NNS ,/, are/VBP struggling/VBG to/TO make/VB a/DT difference/NN ./.

The/DT PALOP/NNP countries/NNS include/VBP Angola/NNP ,/, Mozambique/NNP ,/, Cape/NNP Verde/NNP ,/, Guinea-Bissau/NNP and/CC Sao/NNP Tome/NNP and/CC Principe/NNP ./.

At/IN the/DT conclusion/NN of/IN the/DT war/NN ,/, Angola/NNP ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS resourceful/JJ African/JJ countries/NNS ,/, is/VBZ for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN injecting/VBG more/JJR money/NN from/IN its/PRP$ oil/NN industry/NN ,/, diamond/NN and/CC gold/JJ mines/NNS to/TO the/DT battered/JJ economy/NN ,/, in/IN stead/NN of/IN paying/VBG for/IN weapon/NN bills/NNS ./.
