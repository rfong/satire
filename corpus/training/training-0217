Rice Shower Wins Second Emperor's Cup (BC-Sports-Horse Racing-Emperor's Cup)
Rice Shower held off late-charging Stage Champ by a nose and captured his
second Emperor's Cup Sunday at Kyoto Racecourse.
The 6-year-old Rice Shower, ridden by Hitoshi Matoba, covered the
3,200-meter (2-mile) grass course in 3 minutes, 19.9 seconds.
Two years earlier, Matoba rode the dark bay to his first Emperor's Cup
victory.
Hagino Real King placed third, another three-quarters-length behind, in
the field of 18 horses, all Japanese.
``The horse held out real well. I was not quite sure if I had really
won it because Stage Champ was closing in behind,'' Matoba said.
``It really was a long distance race. I felt the course here was very
long.''
It was the sixth victory -- three of them Grade I races -- in Rice
Shower's 24 lifetime starts. In his last outing, the horse placed
sixth.
Breaking from the No. 3 position, Rice Shower gradually moved up and
took
the lead at the far turn.
The 5-year-old Stage Champ, was ridden by Tadashi Ebina.
The victory, worth 132 million yen (dlrs 1.5 million), increased Rice
Shower's career earnings to 729 million yen (dlrs 8.7 million).
Rice Shower paid 580 yen (dlrs 6.99) to win and 280 yen (dlrs 3.37) to
place for a 100-yen (dlrs 1.20 ) bet. Stage Champ returned 330 yen
(dlrs 3.98) to place while Hagino Real King was worth 190 yen (dlrs
2.29).
