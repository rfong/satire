Chongqing Hosts Military-Turned-Civil Industry Seminar 
An international seminar on military-turned-civil industry, with "New
Business Opportunities in China" as its theme, was held recently in
this leading industrial city of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
The seminar was jointly sponsored by the UN Development and Program,
the UN Development, Co-operation and Management Affairs Department and
China Association of Peaceful Utilization of Military Technologies. It
aims at finding ways to help train senior managerial personnel for
China's military-turned-civil enterprises, develop new products for
civil use, expand international exchanges and co-operation, open up
international market and undertake world-wide co-operation in some
military-turned-civil projects.
China's military enterprises have been successful in the production of
goods for civil use, which has created new business opportunities for
overseas investors in China and helps China's military enterprises keep
in step with the international market.
Participants include celebrities in the business and financial circles
of the United States, Britain, Switzerland, Belgium and Germany, UN
officials and leading figures of domestic military enterprises.
