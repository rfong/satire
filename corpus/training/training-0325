Kenyan Children Plagued by Preventable Diseases 
One out of 10 children in Kenya dies of preventable diseases before the
age of five, the East African Standard newspaper reported today.
The children die mainly of malaria, diarrhoea, vomiting and
malnutrition, J. Mati, Executive Director of the Institute of
Reproductive Health and Research, was quoted as saying.
The growth of up to one-third of children under the age of five is
stunted in the eastern African country, he warned, citing poverty as a
key reason.
Infant mortality rate in the country stood at 67 per 1,000 in 1993
while the birth rate was at 46 per 1,000 and total fertility rate 5.4
percent, he quoted the latest available data as saying.
Mati also called for a review of the government's policy on health
framework which he said should comprehensively improve donor
co-ordination in the prevention of diseases.
