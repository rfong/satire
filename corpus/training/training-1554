IBF Rules Foreman Must Give Schulz Rematch or Forfeit Title 
Heavyweight champion George Foreman must give challenger Axel Schulz of
Germany a rematch or forfeit his title, the International Boxing
Federation ruled Saturday.
The fight must be held within 120 days, the IBF's executive committee
decided at the organization's annual convention. Foreman beat Schulz on
a controversial majority decision April 12, and has said he will not
fight Schulz again.
Spokesman Sy Roseman said the IBF would give promoters for Foreman, 46,
and Schulz 30 days to reach and agreement. After that, they would be
called to the IBF offices in East Orange, in the suburbs of New York
City, to bid for the right to promote the fight.
Foreman's promoter is Bob Arum, while Schulz's is Cedric Kushner.
The IBF raised Schulz's ranking from No. 9 contender to No. 2 at the
meeting.
``He took Foreman to the wall last time,'' Roseman said.
The winner would be required to fight No. 1 contender Franz Botha of
South Africa, Roseman said.
Because of his age, Foreman must submit to an extensive physical by Dr.
Barry Jordan of the New York State Athletic Commission 30 days before
fighting, Roseman said.
``If they don't meet these conditions the IBF will strip Foreman of his
title,'' Roseman said. He said the IBF expects Foreman and Arum to
agree to the terms.
Foreman lost the WBA title for refusing to fight Tony Tucker when
Tucker was the associations's No. 1 contender.
Foreman won the titles by knocking out Michael Moorer in November.
Roseman said a 120-day extension would be granted for the rematch if
requested and probably would be necessary if the fight is held in the
United States to avoid competing with the World Series and other fall
sporting events.
