Singapore shares close 2.0 percent higher 
Singapore share prices galloped 2.0 percent higher Thursday after a
two-day Lunar New Year break on the back of gains in Wall Street,
dealers said.
The Straits Times Index surged 33.950 points to 1,774.63 while the All
Singapore Equities index gained 8.60 points to 464.83.
"The market is just catching up with Wall Street and banks seem to be
taking the lead," a dealer at a local brokerage said.
The gains are unlikely to be sustained unless 1,800 points is broken
convincingly, he said.
Volume reached 431.447 million shares worth 550.534 million dollars
(300.8 million US), up from 159.738 million shares valued at 177.078
million dollars in half-day trading on Monday.
The market was closed Tuesday and Wednesday for the Lunar New Year
holidays.
Banking stocks led Thursday's upwing.
United Overseas Bank rose 50 cents to 14.90 and DBS Group, which
reports 2001 earnings results on Monday, advanced 10 cents to 14.70.
Oversea-Chinese Baking Corp closed 30 cents higher at 13.30.
Analysts, however, expect banking gains to be capped given their
rallies in recent months on the back of economic recovery hopes.
The release of 2001 earnings by the banks in the next two weeks are
expected to mirror the economic downturn.
Technology stocks were mostly higher on gains in the Nasdaq in New
York. Chartered Semiconductor rose 16 cents to 4.28 and Venture
Manufacturing added 50 cents to 14.90.
Creative Technology was up 40 cents at 23.30, while Datacraft Asia
climbed six US cents to 2.37 US dollars.
Conglomerate SembCorp Industries, due to release 2001 earnings on
Wednesday, jumped six cents to 1.88 and Keppel Corp. finished 18 cents
higher at 4.44.
Property stocks ended firmer, led by City Developments which rose 15
cents to 6.55. Keppel Land was up three cents to 1.87 and CapitaLand
was higher by seven cents at 1.97.
