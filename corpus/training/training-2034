Kenyan Wainaina Wins 
Rising Kenyan star Eric Wainaina, surging ahead with a powerful kick up
a hill three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the finish Sunday, won his
second marathon in two tries.
Wainaina's triumph by 13 seconds in the Tokyo International Marathon
followed the 23-year-old Kenyan's victory last year in the Hokkaido
Marathon, his first race at the distance of 42.195 kilometers (26
miles, 385 yards).
Wainaina, who is training under a Japanese coach in Japan, finished in
2 hours, 10 minutes, 31 seconds. Antoni Niemczak of Poland, who had led
after 37 kilometers (23 miles), finished second in 2:10:44, with
Nicholas Kioko of Kenya third 2:10:47.
``It's a bit cooler for me, but I ran well today,'' said Wainaina, who
beat a field of 110 runners over a course through Tokyo streets in
windless, 10-degree Celsius (50 F) weather.
Niemczak, Wainaina, Kioko, Italian Luca Barzaghi, Jan Huruk of Poland
and two Japanese -- Daisuke Tokunaga and Hiroyuki Itoh -- were in the
leading pack after 37 kilometers.
Brazilian Luiz Antonio Dos Santos led through the first 26 kilometers
(16 miles).
Pre-race favorite Abebe Mekonnen of Ethiopia, a three-time winner of
this race, dropped out, as did Japan's Hiromi Taniguchi, who won the
1991 world championship on the same course.
