Experts from Serbia, Montenegro meet under EU auspices 
Experts from Serbia and Montenegro met in Brussels under the auspices
of the European Union Monday to iron out differences in the framework
of the EU's stabilization and association process.
An EU source said the meeting of economic, social and monetary experts
of the Yugoslav federation's two remaining members, the first such
get-together to be held in Brussels, was organized by the EU, which
holds observer status and is contributing legal and technical
assistance.
Since EU high representative for foreign policy Javier Solana went to
Belgrade in December, two other target groups have been formed to
kick-start dialogue: one on constitutional questions, the other on
security and foreign policy.
The EU is prodding both sides toward greater cooperation in all areas
aimed at greater rapprochement with the union under the stabilization
and association pact, the EU #$wgge said.
That process envisages establishment of "privileged" ties between the
EU and the Yugoslav Federation with an eye toward possible EU
membership in the distant future.
"Unresolved questions" between Belgrade and Montenegrin President Milo
Djukanovic "pose real obstacles" to such a rapprochement, he said.
Presidents Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia and Djukanovic met with
Solana late last month, a meeting that produced agreement on Monday's
experts meeting here.
