Britain's York Hit by Highest River Level in Centuries 
Flood water brought about by heavy rain peaked in York, England,
Saturday at the high level since 1625, rising just short of the top of
the emergency barrier.
Thousands of homes, including historic buildings in the area, have been
under threat after the river Ouse breached the city's flood defenses.
The Environment Agency said the river peaked at 17 feet, 8 inches (5.38
m), an inch (2.5 cms) higher than the 1625 flood.
The Meteorological Office is warning of strong winds and outbreaks of
heavy rain from Sunday until Wednesday. David Atkinson of York City
Council said 3,000 homes had been put on evacuation alert.
The army was called in to help council workers place sandbags around
properties in York while the police prepared for the evacuation of up
to 3,000 residents.
An environment agency spokesman said: "People should maintain their
vigilance. People who have not yet evacuated from the areas where there
are severe flood warnings should prepare themselves for evacuation."
