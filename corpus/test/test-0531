Uganda's Greenland Bank to Open Branch in 
The Greenland Bank of Uganda is set to open a branch in Zanzibar
Friday, the Daily News reported today.
Zanzibari President Dr. Salmin Amour will officiate at the opening
ceremony for the branch, which will be the first privately-owned
commercial bank in Zanzibar, the report said.
Zanzibar, a popular tourist destination, presently has the state-run
People's Bank of Zanzibar, the National Bank of Commerce, and the
Tanzanian Postal Bank.
Greenland Bank, established in Uganda in 1991, has so far opened five
branches. In October 1996, it opened the Greenland Forex Bureau (Kenya
Limited).
With the setting up of a branch in Zanzibar, off the east coast of the
Tanzanian mainland, Greenland has formed a financial network in the
east African region.
Financial analysts said that the new branch will stimulate the healthy
competition of banking service in the isles.
