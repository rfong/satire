The Hague wants to amend tough EU action project against drugs 
In a move to maintain the country's soft policy on drugs, Dutch
officials have proposed changes to a European Union project aimed at
reducing drug consumption and trafficking, diplomats said Thursday.
A Dutch delegation proposed a series of amendments to the text during a
meeting Wednesday to prepare for the November 28 and 29 meeting of
European justice and interior ministers, who plan to discuss the
project.
The Netherlands, which recently said it will not toughen drugs laws,
opposes the draft European ruling which envisages harmonising
legislation of various EU member states and ensuring greater
international cooperation between police forces, customs officers and
the judiciary.
The initial plan, proposed by France, to bring national drugs laws of
EU countries closer together does not settle with the Dutch government,
which has defended its permissive drugs policy.
The Hague wants the project changed to concentrate only on "fighting
against illegal trafficking" instead of fighting both drug consumption
and trafficking, the source said.
The amendments also propose the creation of a common office as a means
to reduce international trafficking instead of using the current
proposal to harmonise laws.
Last week the Dutch government said there was no agreement on the text,
saying only that it was characterised by an outdated attitude. A
harmonisation of laws will serve to align national laws with the most
draconian policies, according to The Hague.
EU members will discuss the amendments in their respective capitals
before EU commission president Jacques Santer drafts a new text that
would stand a chance of gaining approval from all 15 members.
