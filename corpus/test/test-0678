Rival Supporters of Hezbollah Clash in Lebanon 
Two Lebanese were wounded in a clash between the rival factions of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah (party of God) Saturday night in the country's
eastern city of Baalbek.
Lebanese NBN radio said that the clash happened between supporters of
the former Hezbollah leader and those of the current political setup.
It said that army has reached the site and controlled the situation.
But it did not give any further details.
Sheikh Sobhi Tufaili, the first Hezbollah secretary general from 1989
to 1991, is wanted by Lebanese military court after a civil
disobedience he led in the impoverished Baalbek was clamped down by
Lebanese army in February this year.
The crackdown, which claimed 18 lives, was caused by a conflict between
his supporters and Hezbollah members over the ownership of a religious
center in the area.
The rebellious Shiite Muslim cleric is reportedly hiding on a hill near
his hometown of Brital in Baalbek, but his anti-government campaign
seems going on.
