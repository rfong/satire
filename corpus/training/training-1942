HK to Deregulate Networks 
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
will not artificially restrain networks in their capability to carry
broadcasting, telecommunications or multimedia services, said K C
Kwong, Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting of Hong
Kong on Tuesday.
"We have decided to remove all restrictions regarding the forms of
service which different types of transmission networks may carry," said
Kwong at the luncheon meeting of the Hong Kong Institute of Directors.
"We have decided to allow fixed telecommunications networks to carry
program services and the cable television network to carry
telecommunications services," he said.
The only caveat is that they will be subject to appropriate licensing
requirements under the respective regulatory regimes, he added.
Rapid advances in technology, coupled with changing market environment,
are blurring and dissolving the traditional boundaries of
telecommunications and broadcasting, he pointed out.
Kwong also told the meeting that the government had earlier decided on
a progressive liberalization of the external facilities market from
January 1 this year in order to enhance Hong Kong's external
connectivity.
The government will announce shortly the results of the applications
for licenses to provide external telecommunications facilities and to
operate local wireless fixed networks.
Turning to the television side, Kwong said the government had decided
to open up the TV market for competition.
To this end, the government had invited applications for the provision
of new television services last August and 10 applications had been
received, he said.
