Iraq Reiterates Stance on Exporting 
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid today reiterated Iraq's stance
that it will not start exporting oil unless an agreement on a new food
distribution plan is approved by the United Nations.
At a news conference in the northern Iraqi province of al-Tameen on the
occasion of first anniversary of Iraq's resumption of oil exports,
Rasheed said Iraq is capable of meeting all future world need for
crude, whether in accordance with the oil-for-food deal or not.
His remarks indicate that Iraq has not changed its stance on this
issue. Some recent reports said Iraq has agreed to cooperate with the
U.N. Security Council to extend the deal for another period of six
months.
A Security Council resolution adopted in 1995 allows the
sanctions-ridden Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over
every six months and to buy food and medicines. It was put into effect
a year ago and the third phase was supposed to start last Thursday.
Iraq stopped exporting its oil last Friday, saying that it will not
export any more fuel until the United Nations approves a new plan for
distributing food bought with oil revenues.
In the following months, Iraq will be able to produce and export 2.5
million barrels per day, said Rashid.
The oil minister stressed that the total amounts of food and medicines
Iraq has received so far do not exceed 55 percent of the contracts
signed under the first phase of the oil-for-food deal.
He said that many contracts are still being held up by the U.N.
Sanctions Committee, including 14 percent of medicine contracts, 20
percent of electricity contracts and others in the field of education,
agriculture, water and sewage in addition to contracts for the purchase
of spare parts for the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline.
He accused the United States of continuing obstructing all contracts
concluded within the first and second phases of the deal, with the aim
of maintaining the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
The crippling economic sanctions were imposed by the United Nations in
1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
