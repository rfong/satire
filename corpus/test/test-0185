More State-Owned Cinemas to Be Privatized in Myanmar 
Nineteen more state-owned cinemas in various cities of Myanmar will be
privatized in the form of leasing out to local private entrepreneurs or
government employees' organizations for continuous business operation,
according to a notification of the Myanmar Information Ministry
Wednesday.
The cinemas under the ministry's Motion Picture Enterprise including
those in Yangon, Mandalay, Myitkyina, Mawlamyine, Taungngu and
Hinthada, will be allowed to run the business beginning July 25 when
related contracts are reached.
Earlier this year, over 100 other state-run cinemas in various states
and divisions, and some 42 factories and two livestock breeding farms
under other ministries were designated to be sold through competitive
bidding.
So far, more than two dozen state-owned saw mills in the country have
been reportedly privatized.
Since Myanmar announced privatization of 51 state-owned economic
enterprises (SEEs) in the first phase in January 1995, the
privatization process has been underway in various forms including
auctioning and leasing out the SEEs or establishing joint ventures with
local and foreign entrepreneurs or operating either under buy-back or
counter-trade system.
