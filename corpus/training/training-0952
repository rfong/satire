India's Ruling Party Releases Manifesto 
India's ruling Congress party (Congress-Indira) today vowed to wage an
all out war against corruption and promised stability, progress and
national unity if voted to power.
The party's 40-page election manifesto, released here by party
president P.V. Narasimha Rao, pledged to establish Lok Pal (people's
supervision commission) with jurisdiction over all political offices
including that of the prime minister and the chief ministers in a bid
to control and contain corruption.
The release of the manifesto was delayed by over an hour than expected
with reporters making a scramble for limited copies of the document
made available shortly before the arrival of Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister.
None of the Hawala-tainted ministers were present on the occasion. The
Hawala case is a 18-million-US-dollar bribery scandal involving dozens
of the country's leading politicians.
The manifesto said the Congress-Indira is committed to providing an
effective government for a stable polity, to preserving and promoting
unity and integrity of India in which every section of the country can
live in harmony and in pursuit of happiness.
"The Congress theme for this election is stability, national security,
harmony and development", it said.
The document said the Congress-Indira government had fulfilled almost
all the promises made in the manifesto of 1991.
Spelling out its vision for the next five years, the party promised
houses for the houseless poor, jobs for jobless so as to provide near
full employment by the year 2002.
