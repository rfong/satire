Italian court scraps drugs trial after defendants die 
An Italian court was forced to scrap a drugs trafficking trial because
all the defendants had died, judicial officials said Wednesday.
The five accused, born between 1952 and 1965, and all drug addicts,
were arrested in 1986 for possession and trafficking in a few grammes
of heroin.
Their trial was finally set down to begin on Tuesday at Como court,
northern Italy, having being delayed for more than 10 years after the
alleged crimes were committed because of chronic staffing problems.
However, the hearing was abandoned after it emerged that all the
defendants had died in the 10-year interim. The causes of death were
not revealed.
Italy has some 9,000 judges, compared with, for example, the 6,000 in
France, but, of all European countries, it is the one where the wheels
of justice turn the most slowly.
The European Court of Justice in Strasbourg has repeatedly condemned
Italy for breaching the right to be tried within "a reasonable delay."
In January, the government adopted reforms to attempt to relieve the
load of courts overwhelmed with corruption and Mafia cases.
