Edberg falls, Ferreira advances 
Sweden's Stefan Edberg, ranked fourth in the world, fell to Spain's
Alex Corretja 1-6, 6-2, 6-4 here Friday in a lethargic show at the
915,000-dollar ATP US Hardcourt Championships.
The upset by Corretja, a 20-year-old who eliminated Jim Courier
earlier, left South Africa's Wayne Ferreira the only seeded
semi-finalist in the event.
"I was one step too slow. I had no legs," said Edberg, who had played a
third-round match just 18 hours earlier.
Corretja became aggressive when he saw Edberg tiring.
"I saw him moving not so well and I had to take the chance because you
never know, maybe I can beat him," Corretja said.
Ferreira eliminated Sweden's Thomas Enqvist 6-2, 6-2, to advance to a
semi-final matchup with Corretja.
"These are the matches I tend to let the person back in, even though he
is not playing well," Ferreira said. "Today I cut him off really quick,
which is good."
France's Olivier Delaitre reached his second career semi-final, ousting
Jonathan Stark 6-4, 7-6 (10/8).
