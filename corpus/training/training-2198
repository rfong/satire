Attacker of settlers' bus identified as Hamas militant 
A Palestinian assailant who killed 10 Israelis in a daring bomb and
machine-gun fire attack on a settlers' bus Wednesday was a Hamas
militant whose brother died exactly a month ago in an Israeli raid,
Palestinian security sources said.
Assem Rihan, 23, was a "known Hamas militant" and a student from
Al-Najah University in the West Bank town of Nablus, the sources told
AFP.
His brother, Mohammed Rihan, 25, also an activist in the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas), died in an exchange of fire with Israeli
army elite troops in the Palestinian autonomous village of Tell, near
Nablus, on November 12.
Mohammed Rihan was accused by Israel of participating in the murder
three years ago of two Jewish settlers near Nablus, a few kilometres
(miles) north of Tell, Israeli public radio reported at the time.
Wednesday's ambush left around 30 people injured and was the worst
attack targeting Jewish settlers since the start of the Palestinian
intifada, uprising, 14 months ago.
According to the Israeli army the assailant exploded a bomb as a bus of
settlers approached the settlement of Emmanuel just south of Nablus and
then attacked it with machine-gun fire before soldiers killed him.
A radical offshoot of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, the Al-Aqsa
Brigades, said in a statement that it and Hamas were jointly
responsible for the attack, in a statement received by AFP.
Ezzedin al-Qassam, the military wing of Hamas, earlier claimed
responsibility for the bus ambush, the television station run by
Lebanon's Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah reported.
An Israeli defence ministry spokesman, in a statement received by AFP,
said the attack was carried out by Hamas militants whose names figured
on a list of 33 activists wanted by Israel.
Israel last week said it gave the list to Arafat.
