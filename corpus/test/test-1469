Six journalists resign in Tiananmen documentary row 
Six senior journalists with Hong Kong-based Asia Television (ATV)
resigned Wednesday, carrying out a threat to quit in a row over the
screening of TV footage on the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
The journalists, from ATV's news and public affairs departments, handed
in their notice after the management rejected screening the programme,
which contained previously unreleased footage of the crackdown.
The footage, shot by a Spanish television crew, was to be aired
Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the June 4 crushing of the
pro-democracy protests.
Although the management backed down Tuesday, allowing the journalists
to decide when and how the footage should be presented, the six decided
Wednesday to go ahead with their resignation.
"We feel we have come to a point where irreparable damage has been done
to our working relations, mutual trust and confidence," acting news
controller Poon Fu-yin told reporters.
The management's decision to pull the film triggered an outcry about
media self-censorship in sensitive matters relating to China in the
run-up to Hong Kong's 1997 reversion to Chinese rule.
ATV chief executive officer Mark Lee denied any intention of preventing
broadcast of the footage, which was slotted for a news magazine
programme.
The management had only suggested that it would be "more appropriate"
to show the footage in another programme screened without commentary,
he said.
According to an official toll, several hundred people were killed when
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) swept into Tiananmen Square and the
surrounding streets to crush a seven-week-old campaign for democracy.
But human rights groups say several thousand were killed.
