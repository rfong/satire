Chile congressional elections kick off calmly 
Chileans went to the polls here early Sunday in good spirits under good
weather to elect a new congress, police and media reported.
About eight million voters are expected to cast ballots to elect all
120 members of the Chamber of Deputies and 18 of the 48-member Senate,
38 of whom are elected by popular vote and ten appointed.
Chile's coalition of center-left parties hopes to win enough seats to
finally be able to amend the constitution inherited from dictator
Augusto Pinochet.
The former military chief unseated elected Socialist president Salvador
Allende in a bloody coup and ruled from 1973 to 1990.
The ailing former dictator imposed a constitution that mandates the
seating of eight hand-picked senators whose votes are needed to amend
the constitution.
The Senate currently includes two senators-for-life -- former president
Eduardo Frei and Pinochet himself.
