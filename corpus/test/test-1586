Branson in Bank of England bid
Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group has launched an audacious bid to buy
the Bank of England.
It was announced earlier this week that the Virgin Group bid to buy
struggling bank Northern Rock had been overlooked by the Government in
favour of nationalising the failing business.
This move came after the Government lent £50bn in money and guarantees
to Northern Rock last summer after the credit crunch in North America
spread globally.
Now it seems as though Sir Richard is attempting to buy Northern Rock
through the back door.
Sources close to the coiffured billionaire suggest that his offer was
made to Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown late on Wednesday night in
the back-room of the Rose and Crown pub in Wandsworth.
It seems that although the offer was only half-serious, Messrs Darling
and Brown have been looking to off-load the Bank of England for the
some time now, and replace it with the Bank of Scotland.
This deal would see the Bank of England, along with the National Debt
of England and Northern Rock, being taken over by the Virgin Group. The
Bank of Scotland would then be moved, in its entirety, to London, where
the existing English currency would be removed from circulation, and
replaced with those Scottish £20 notes which are so hard to
counterfeit.
The move would also see the National Debt (estimated to be around
£500bn) be written off, and the debt assumed by the Virgin Group.
Apparently, Sir Richard feels he will repay this within 10 years, by a
mixture of more aggressive sales policies from the Group's Consumer
divisions.
The landlord of the Rose and Crown confirmed "Yes, they were here.
Branson seemed like he'd been drinking all day, and was obviously the
worse for it when he came in. The other two gents were Scottish, and
didn't drink much, although they did ply him with booze until gone
midnight."
Branson's offer for "The Old Lady" is apparently £50bn, two packets of
Cheese and Onion crisps, half a cider and black, three packets of
dry-roasted peanuts and two large doner kebabs.
Keen city observers were quick to point out that this represented a
very good deal for Branson, and they thought that the two statesmen
would hold out for "at least a cheese and tomato pizza and a can of
coke."
A spokesman for the Government declined to comment, saying merely "I'm
afraid I've been unable to contact either the Prime Minister or the
Chancellor to confirm this story, as they are both asleep in the front
room of No.10 with the television on. The Chancellor is resting on what
appears to be a kebab."
