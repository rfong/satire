Iranian Reformists Claim Landslide Victory in Crucial Polling 
Iranian reformists on Tuesday claimed a landslide victory in last
Friday's crucial parliamentary poll by having won 109 seats in the
290-member Parliament as vote counting continues.
Of the 191 parliamentarians already elected, 109 are candidates of the
reformist Islamic Iran Participation (IIPF), Mohammed Reza Khatami,
younger brother of the moderate President Mohammed Khatami, told a
press conference.
Khatami said the "May 23 Front" formed by the IIPF and other reformist
and centralist groups in support of the president have won 137 out of
the 191 seats while the conservatives have only occupied 39 and the
remaining 15 have been occupied by independents.
The vote counting for 260 seats have finished, but 69 seats must be
determined in the second round of polling, but who will win the 30
seats in Tehran constituency will not be announced before Thursday.
The initial result showed the reformists, who support the president and
his reform policies, are poised to gain control of the parliament from
the powerful conservatives in the polls held Friday.
