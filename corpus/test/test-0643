Yao Ming's Self-Written Wedding Vows Include How He Loves The Top Of His
Wife's Head
Houston Rockets and Chinese national team center Yao Ming, 7'6", married
his longtime 6'3" girlfriend, Ye Li, last week in a ceremony for which Yao
wrote nuptial vows praising, among other things, the top of Ye's head. "Ye,
my beloved, to glimpse the onyx brilliance of the top of your head sends
through me a rush of love strong enough to lift a thousand mountains," Yao
intoned nervously yet earnestly as he gazed almost straight down into Ye's
eyes. "And your dear sweet shoulders are like two tiny, distant doves
nesting beneath that deep abiding well of wisdom and kindness." Yao's
poetic efforts were obviously much appreciated by his beaming wife and
generally well-received by family and friends, although Yao seemed annoyed
when asked by American sports reporters if Ye's feet "looked like they'd
been bound when seen from all the way up there."
