Robert Shapiro, Simpson's lead defense attorney, said the motion was
prompted by several factors including interest in speeding up the
trial, avoiding juror exposure to pre-trial publicity and financial
concerns.
``We don't want to take eight weeks out of our schedule to do this,''
Shapiro said. ``It would have to be done twice if the DNA is admitted
in a Kelly-Frye hearing. We're going to do it once.''
Legal experts say the motion, if granted, would present a problem for
prosecutors in detailing to jurors a case where circumstantial evidence
is critical. A mid-trial hearing could also disrupt the momentum of the
prosecution's case.
With no murder weapon and no eyewitness testimony, the most persuasive
evidence in the case may be blood samples taken from the crime scene,
Simpson's Ford Bronco and his estate in the Los Angeles area of
Brentwood.
``Not only is there no downside on the defense but they really put the
prosecution is a quandary,'' said Myrna Raeder, a Southwestern
University law professor. ``I don't know why they think the prosecution
would buy into this.''
Ultimately, legal observers said, Ito has the discretion to decide
whether to hold a DNA-admissibility hearing before the jury. Several
legal experts doubted Ito would grant such a motion.
Even if Ito allows the DNA test results into evidence, defense lawyers
are certain to mount a double-barreled challenge to them.
Experts surely will criticize the manner in which the blood samples
were collected and preserved, as well as the weight that should be
given to any of the results.
