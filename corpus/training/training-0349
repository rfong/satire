Defending Champion Michael Chang Wins Salem Open 
Top seed Michael Chang of the United States beat Sweden's Jonas
Bjorkman 6-3, 6-1 Sunday and won the Hong Kong Salem Open for the
second straight year.
Playing in front of Britain's Princess Diana, who is on a three-day
visit to Hong Kong, Chang lost his serve in the first game before
overpowering the fifth-seeded Bjorkman in one hour.
Chang, ranked eighth in the world, defied the 30-degree Celsius (86 F)
heat in an all-out display of exquisite net play and solid baseline
strokes.
The first set featured a series of service breaks, with the American
edging the Swede 3-2.
Bjorkman served one of his best games to take a 1-0 lead in the second
set, but that was all he could do as the American broke him three more
times to take the match.
It was Chang's 20th title of his career and took his lifetime earnings
above dlrs 6.5 million.
Chang dedicated his victory to the people of Hong Kong, who have taken
the Chinese-American to their hearts since he first visited the
territory eight years ago.
``It makes it a heck of a lot easier for me to play in Hong Kong
because of the support I get from the fans,'' Chang said.
He also said it was exciting to have a member of the British royal
family watching.
Chang, who collected dlrs 43,000, said he hoped that the next time
Diana watches him play ``it will be at a tournament on grass
(Wimbledon).''
Bjorkman, ranked 27th, said he was affected by the heat.
``It is tough for a European in Asia because it is quite hot in this
part of the world, but overall I am happy to have got this far,'' he
said.
American Tommy Ho and Australian Mark Philippoussis upset third seeds
Australian John Fitzgerald and Sweden's Anders Jarryd 6-1, 6-7 (2-7),
7-6 (7-3) for the doubles title.
