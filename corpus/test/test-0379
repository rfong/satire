Malaysia Grand Prix May Be Canceled 
International organisers have warned Malaysia will be be dropped from
the circuit completely if it fails to stage its world motorcycle grand
prix in April as scheduled, local reports said here on Tuesday.
The Automobile Association of Malaysia (AAM), one of the local
sponsors, said race organiser Dorna had threatened to cut Malaysia off
the grand prix circuit if this year's race did not go ahead on April
13.
Malaysia's central Selangor state, which has hosted the event since
1991 at the Shah Alam race circuit, has said it does not plan to renew
its contract for the 1997 race after disagreeing with certain
conditions set by Dorna.
