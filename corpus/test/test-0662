Jordan Denounces Israeli Actions in Jerusalem 
Jordan reiterated here today its denounciation of Israeli actions in
Arab East Jerusalem, saying that they constitute obstacles in the way
of the Middle East peace process.
Jordan's acting Foreign Minister Abdul Hadi Majali said that it was a
firmly announced Jordanian position that the geographical nature of
Jerusalem along with other cities should not be tempered with.
He blamed Israel for its hardline stance which, he said, turned
negotiations with the Palestinians to the "zero" point.
The Israeli government's decision to open a tourist tunnel near the Al
Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem has led to new waves of protests and
denounciations from Arab world and an unprecedented severe conflict
between the Palestinians and Israeli forces.
Israeli troops reportedly shot dead at least 10 Palestinians and
wounded over 70 others in clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
today.
The conflict between Palestinians and Israeli troops has prompted
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut short his current
visit in Germany.
Analysts here said that the current conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians, Israel's shelling of south Lebanon and the trade of
verbal attacks between Tel Aviv and Cairo might derail the Middle East
peace process, which has been deadlocked since Israeli former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres launched a military operation in South Lebanon.
They believe that the peace process could be ruined by Netanyahu's
hardline policy vis-a-vis the peace talks unless the Israeli government
shifted its attitude towards the agreed-upon principle of "land for
peace."
