WELFARE
For many participants in the national debate over welfare reform,
welfare is spelled ``AFDC,'' the program of Aid for Families With
Dependent Children.
It's the program that gave rise to Ronald Reagan's florid description
of a ``welfare queen'' getting rich by abusing the system.
It's the program that some blame for the disintegration of families
because it encourages fathers with low-paying jobs to leave home so
their children can qualify for AFDC benefits.
AFDC is blamed for the explosive growth of out-of-wedlock births
because it provides an economic support system for single mothers. It's
criticized for encouraging long-term dependency on government payments
and for doing little to promote self-sufficiency.
``Distrust and anger with the current system unite the entire
country,'' says David T. Ellwood, one of the Clinton administration's
top welfare reform architects, discussing the AFDC program.
AFDC is the ``dole.'' It's a state-federal cash welfare program for
children and their mothers who lack financial support because one
parent is absent from the home or is incapacitated, deceased or
unemployed.
AFDC is an entitlement program, which guarantees that any American
meeting the eligibility requirements will receive benefits, regardless
of the total cost.
Approximately 14.1 people received AFDC cash in 1993, up from 7.4
million beneficiaries in 1970.
AFDC benefit expenditures have also skyrocketed, from $4.1 billion in
1970 to $22.3 billion in 1993. In 1970, the federal government spent
$2.2 billion and the states $1.9 billion. In 1993, the federal share
for AFDC was $12.3 billion, while the states contributed the rest.
At the same time, the average AFDC monthly benefit per family climbed
from $178 in 1970 to $373 in 1993.
According to Bruce Reed, the White House deputy policy director
overseeing the welfare reform effort, soaring numbers of out-of-wedlock
mothers account for the rapid growth in AFDC caseloads.
``Unwed teen births are the No. 1 engine driving the welfare rolls,''
says Reed, saying that the number of such births have doubled since
1978.
Two-thirds of AFDC recipients are children, 53 percent of whom were
born out of wedlock, according to the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress. About half of all unwed teen mothers go
on welfare within one year of the birth of their child, 77 percent go
on within five years. Racially, 31 percent of AFDC recipients are
white, 38 percent black, 17.4 percent Hispanic, and 13.6 percent native
Americans, Asians and others.
The AFDC program is administered by the states. Each state defines
``need,'' sets benefit levels and administers the program.
Eligibility for AFDC insures eligibility for food stamps and Medicaid,
the state-federal health care program for the poor.
The states traditionally have been at liberty to pay as little or as
much in benefits as they choose. However, federal standards require
that children up to age 18 are eligible.
AFDC eligibility and benefits are determined monthly, with each state
establishing a ``need standard.'' This is the amount of income the
state decides is needed for basic existence.
Each state also sets a ``payment standard,'' usually 100 percent or
less of the ``need standard.'' Benefits are generally computed by
subtracting the individual's income from the state's payment standard.
Maximum AFDC payments vary sharply from state to state. For example,
state payments for AFDC families of three in January 1994 were: $120 in
Mississippi, $164 in Alabama, $607 in California, $577 in New York,
$184 in Texas, $546 in Washington, $459 in Michigan, and $923 in
Alaska.
A number of proposals were made last year to overhaul AFDC but the
subject was ignored by Congress as it focused on health care reform.
However, the political climate in 1995 appears ripe for overhauling the
system that many liberals and conservatives agree needs a big fix.
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S PROPOSALS:
-- Provide expanded training and child care for families so they can
improve their earning power and get off welfare.
-- Require recipients born after 1971 to work after two years on AFDC,
except women with children younger than one year.
-- Let recipients earn additional money without losing benefits so they
won't be discouraged from looking for work.
-- Allow states to deny additional benefits to women who have
additional children.
HOUSE REPUBLICAN PROPOSALS:
-- Impose over-all spending limits on AFDC.
-- Limit benefits to five years, but let states cut them off after two
years.
-- Deny cash payments to unmarried mothers under age 18 and many legal
non-citizen immigrants.
-- Require unmarried mothers over 18 to establish paternity and to live
at home as a condition of receiving assistance.
SENATE REPUBLICAN PROPOSALS:
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., the chairwoman of the Labor and Human
Resources Committee, has proposed that the federal government take over
Medicaid in exchange for the states taking over a number of welfare
programs, including AFDC. In that event, each state could design its
own AFDC program.
