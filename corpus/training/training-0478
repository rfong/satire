Backgrounder: Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Conference on
Guilin city in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will host the
6th General Assembly of the Asia- Pacific Parliamentarians Conference on
Environment and Development from October 14 to October 18.
The conference, initially called East Asia and Pacific Parliamentarians
Conference on Environment and Development, was first convened in Seoul,
the Republic of Korea (ROK), in June 1993.
The first regional parliamentarians organization, with 45 member
countries, met annually and was established at the proposal of the
League on Children, Population and Environment of the National Assembly
of ROK, with China as one of the founding members.
It was created in order to call on governments of various countries to
pay attention to environment and sustainable development in making
policies through the joint efforts of parliamentarians in Asia and the
Pacific region; and to promote cooperation between developed and
developing countries in the field of environment and development.
The previous five annual meetings, hosted by ROK, Thailand, Malaysia,
New Zealand and ROK, focused on forest protection, ocean environment
and technology transfer with regard to the environment.
The theme of the upcoming assembly will be the protection of the
environment and natural resources versus the sustainable development of
the tourism industry.
