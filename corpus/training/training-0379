Malaysia and Vietnam to jointly operate oilfield 
Malaysia and Vietnam are to jointly start commercial exploitation of a
new oilfield located on the sea overlapping the two countries, a report
said Friday.
Results of an exploration of the oilfield conducted by a group of
foreign companies including Canadian International Petroleum
Conglomerate showed that the new oilfield could have an estimated daily
output of up to 10,200 barrels of oil and 179,000 cubic feet of gas,
the Saigon Times daily reported.
Commercial exploitation of the oilfield is scheduled to start in July
by IPC, PetroVietnam, Malaysia's Petronas Carigali and Sweden's Sands
Petroleum.
Vietnam operates three oilfields off its southern coast known as Dai
Hung (Big Bear), Bach Ho (White Tiger) and Rong (Dragon).
