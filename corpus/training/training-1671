Cuba's Pedroso Makes Best Jump of the Year 
Cuba's Ivan Pedroso warmed up for next month's world championships in a
perfect way by making the best long jump this year by leading to 8.60
meters at a Padua athletic meet on Saturday.
Pedroso's jump improved the 8.56-m mark of Spain's Yago Lamela in Turin
on Thursday.
