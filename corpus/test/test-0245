Japan's retail sales up 2.8 percent in March 
Japan's retail sales in March rose 2.8 percent from a year earlier,
following a 0.8 percent year-on-year gain in February, the ministry of
international trade and industry said Friday.
Sales at department stores rose 4.6 percent after rising 4.0 percent in
February, while sales at supermarkets increased 0.9 percent to reverse
a 1.9 percent fall in the previous month, the ministry said.
The ministry noted that March marked the first time in the past 16
months that both department and supermarket sales rose year-on-year.
Retail sales expanded partly because March 1996 had one extra trading
day than March 1995, while the March 1995 retail sales were also
depressed in the aftermath of a massive earthquake in Kobe and its
vicinity, it said.
"Department store sales rose overall also because corporate demand for
furniture was strong in March," a ministry official said.
The official said lower prices for fruits and fresh vegetables were the
main reasons behind the stronger supermarket sales, which rose for the
first time in 13 months.
Although retail sales showed strong signs of a recovery, the official
said it was still unclear whether this trend would continue.
