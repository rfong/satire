Iran Re-asserts Claim of Sovereignty Over Disputed 
Iran Tuesday reiterated its claim of sovereignty over the three islands
of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tunbs in the Gulf, saying they are
inseparable parts of Iranian territory.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi made the remarks
after the Gulf states called on Iran Monday to settle its dispute with
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the three strategic islands.
Asefi said that the only way to settle the existing "misunderstanding"
between Iran and the UAE is to hold bilateral talks, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
Foreign Ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on Monday urged
Iran to peacefully solve the dispute with the UAE through direct
international negotiations or by resorting to the international courts
of justice.
The GCC states reiterated their support for the UAE's sovereignty over
the three disputed islands at the mouth of the strategic Hormoz Strait.
Iran took over the islands in 1971 after the British forces pulled out
from the region. However, both Tehran and Abu Dhabi claimed sovereignty
over the islands.
During the past years, Iran insisted on bilateral talks to solve the
issue, but the UAE called for an international arbitration.
The UAE recently lodged protest to Iran's move to build infrastructural
facilities and launch military maneuvers near the Abu Musa island.
The Iranian spokesman urged the UAE government to accept bilateral
talks within the framework of the 1971 accord between the two
countries.
He argued that Iran has the absolute right to stage military maneuvers
for defensive purposes and in line with the territorial integrity of
the country.
Asefi also called on the GCC states to promote relations, mutual trust
and dialog with Iran.
Meanwhile, the hardline Iranian daily Jomhuri Islami (Islamic Republic)
called on the Iranian government to reconsider its policies towards the
UAE and recall its ambassador from Abu Dhabi.
In a strong-worded commentary, the paper lashed out at the UAE
government for what it called the UAE's "hostile stance" towards Iran
and said that Iran should break off "all commercial and touristic ties
with this tiny country."
