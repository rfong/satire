Pakistan says no reduction in tension with India after Blair visit 
Military tensions between Pakistan and India have not eased over the
past 24 hours, Pakistan said Tuesday, after British Prime Minister Tony
Blair completed a peace-making mission to South Asia.
Asked if there had been any change in the stand off between the two
nuclear rivals foreign ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said: "For
the moment no".
However, he stressed that Pakistan would not stop trying to bring India
to the negotiating table to discuss their differences.
"That does not mean we should be discouraged and give up our efforts of
reducing tension and of moving to a resolution of all disputes through
peaceful means," he told reporters.
