Ex-champ surprises young fans 
Youth baseball players in this state capitol are still talking about a
surprise visit from former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson
over the weekend.
Tyson attended a Little League baseball game here Saturday to watch the
opening game of the season of the son of his co-manager, Rory Holloway,
a friend since their childhood here.
Tyson stayed for about two hours, signing autographs for dozens of
players and their parents.
"Anything they stuck in his face, he was more than willing to sign,"
said Eileen Silvia, among those on hand to watch the games.
Tyson, who completed a three-year prison sentence for rape in March,
plans to fight his comeback bout later this year.
