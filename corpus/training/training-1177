U.S. Supreme Court Grants Bush's Plea to Stop Recounts
The action came after Bush asked the U.S. high court Friday to block
hand recounts of disputed ballots in Florida State.
The U.S. Florida Supreme Court Friday ordered manual recounts to start
immediately in the state's contested presidential election, keeping
alive Democrat Al Gore's hope of winning the U.S. presidency.
The U.S. high court in a brief order by a 5-4 vote granted Bush 's
emergency plea for a stay of the Florida Supreme Court ruling that
ordered hand recounts of tens of thousands of ballots in Florida's
contested presidential election.
The Supreme Court said it scheduled 90 minutes of oral arguments in the
case on December 11. The 5-4 vote split along conservative and liberal
lines.
At issue was Friday's Florida Supreme Court ruling that also cut Bush's
lead in the state to just 154 votes. Both Bush and Gore need Florida's
25 Electoral College votes to win the presidency.
