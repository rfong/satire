Tearful/NNP Palmer/NNP bows/VBZ out/RP to/TO a/DT Masters/NNP roar/NN by/IN Erskine/NNP McCullough/NNP An/DT emotional/JJ Arnold/NNP Palmer/NNP walked/VBD off/RP the/DT 18th/JJ green/NN for/IN the/DT last/JJ time/NN in/IN the/DT Masters/NNPS here/RB on/IN Saturday/NNP to/TO roars/NNP of/IN appreciation/NN from/IN a/DT packed/JJ crowd/NN wanting/VBG to/TO pay/VB their/PRP$ respect/NN to/TO the/DT player/NN dubbed/VBN the/DT King/NNP ./.

Some/DT of/IN the/DT biggest/JJS names/NNS in/IN golf/NN ,/, including/VBG Nick/NNP Faldo/NNP and/CC Greg/NNP Norman/NNP ,/, came/VBD out/RP to/TO witness/VB the/DT end/NN of/IN an/DT era/NN ./.

Palmer/NNP struggled/VBD to/TO hold/VB back/RP the/DT tears/NNS as/IN he/PRP made/VBD his/PRP$ way/NN through/IN the/DT 20-deep/JJ crowd/NN to/TO the/DT scorer/NN 's/POS hut/NN to/TO sign/VB his/PRP$ last/JJ score/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB seen/VBN anything/NN quite/RB like/IN this/DT ./.

I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN big/JJ crowds/NNS and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN people/NNS but/CC this/DT was/VBD unbelieveable/JJ ,/, ''/'' said/VBD the/DT 72-year-old/JJ four-time/JJ Masters/NNP champion/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD only/RB on/IN Thursday/NNP that/IN Palmer/NNP decided/VBD that/IN his/PRP$ 48th/JJ consecutive/JJ Masters/NNS was/VBD going/VBG to/TO be/VB his/PRP$ last/JJ ./.

His/PRP$ 17-over/JJ par/NN 89/CD opening/NN round/NN ,/, matching/VBG his/PRP$ worse/JJR ever/RB score/NN here/RB ,/, had/VBD convinced/VBN him/PRP that/IN he/PRP no/RB longer/RB had/VBD the/DT game/NN over/IN the/DT lengthened/NNP Augusta/NNP National/NNP ./.

``/`` I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sad/JJ ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Palmer/NNP about/IN his/PRP$ decision/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP 'm/VBP just/RB going/VBG to/TO fade/VB away/RP and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT time/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT question/NN Augusta/NNP has/VBZ meant/VBN an/DT awful/JJ lot/NN to/TO me/PRP over/IN the/DT years/NNS ,/, perhaps/RB the/DT one/CD tournament/NN that/IN kick/NN started/VBD my/PRP$ career/NN ./.

I/PRP love/VBP Augusta/NNP ./. ''/''

Palmer/NNP should/MD have/VB had/VBN his/PRP$ final/JJ farewell/NN on/IN Friday/NNP but/CC as/IN he/PRP came/VBD off/RP the/DT 13th/JJ tee/NN the/DT heavens/NNS open/JJ and/CC organisers/JJ were/VBD forced/VBN to/TO suspend/VB play/NN until/IN Saturday/NNP ./.

``/`` I/PRP was/VBD very/RB excited/JJ ,/, ''/'' joked/VBD Palmer/NNP ./.

``/`` I/PRP had/VBD not/RB played/VBN on/IN Saturday/NNP for/IN a/DT very/RB long/JJ time/NN ./. ''/''

Palmer/NNP admitted/VBD that/IN he/PRP had/VBD thought/VBN about/IN playing/VBG here/RB for/IN two/CD more/JJR years/NNS ./.

``/`` At/IN one/CD point/NN I/PRP thought/VBD about/IN doing/VBG 50/CD and/CC playing/VBG right/RB through/IN but/CC it/PRP just/RB seemed/VBD like/IN this/DT is/VBZ appropiate/JJ this/DT year/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP my/PRP$ game/NN is/VBZ really/RB not/RB good/JJ ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Palmer/NNP ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, it/PRP might/MD have/VB been/VBN his/PRP$ last/JJ professional/JJ appearance/NN ./.

``/`` If/IN I/PRP continue/VBP to/TO play/VB as/RB poorly/RB as/IN I/PRP have/VBP recently/RB I/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB out/IN there/RB ./.

I/PRP promise/VBP you/PRP that/DT ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Palmer/NNP ./.

Masters/NNP chairman/NN Hootie/NNP Johnson/NNP said/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB impossible/JJ to/TO list/VB all/DT of/IN Palmer/NNP 's/POS achievements/NNS over/IN the/DT Augusta/NNP National/NNP course/NN ./.

``/`` He/PRP has/VBZ provided/VBN us/PRP with/IN countless/JJ years/NNS of/IN excitment/NN and/CC thrills/VBZ and/CC has/VBZ shown/VBN us/PRP how/WRB the/DT game/NN of/IN golf/NN is/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB played/VBN ./.

We/PRP owe/VBP a/DT debt/NN to/TO Arnold/NNP and/CC he/PRP will/MD always/RB have/VB a/DT very/RB special/JJ place/NN in/IN Masters/NNP history/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Johnson/NNP ./.

Greg/NNP Norman/NNP was/VBD equally/RB full/JJ of/IN praise/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP every/DT player/NN ,/, from/IN the/DT modern/JJ player/NN like/IN Tiger/NNP Woods/NNP to/TO the/DT old/JJ guys/NNS like/IN me/PRP ,/, should/MD take/VB their/PRP$ hats/NNS off/RP to/TO Arnold/NNP ./.
