Airbus, Go in exclusive talks for 75 planes
The European aerospace company Airbus buzzed past US rival Boeing to win
exclusive talks rights with British budget airline Go on an order of 75
aircraft worth up to three billion dollars (3.3 billion euros), The Wall
Street Journal Europe reported Friday.
Go directors decided on Thursday to begin negotiations with Airbus for
its single-aisle group of A319, A320 and A321 models, which have a
capacity of between 130 and 190 seats.
If successful, Airbus will have notched up a major strategic gain in
Europe's booming no-frills market, the newspaper said.
"The order could be finalized within a few weeks," it added.
Go, the third biggest European low-cost carrier, currently flies Boeing
737s, as do larger rivals Ryanair and easyJet.
The budget sector is one of the few bright spots in the otherwise
ailing aviation industry, the newspaper noted.
By operating exclusively with one type of aircraft, carriers are able
to reduce maintenance costs, a major element in their budgets.
Airbus "has sorely wanted to land a customer among Europe's
fast-growing crop of no-frills airlines", the report said.
"Airbus and Boeing are competing furiously for every plane order,"
allowing carriers to drive hard bargains.
But executives at both companies told the newspaper they were still
making a profit on deals, "and that the planes aren't going at
fire-sale prices".
Airlines have nonetheless "boasted of the favorable terms they managed
to negotiate, and Go aims to grab the opportunity", the report said.
