President/NNP Bill/NNP Clinton/NNP announced/VBD Monday/NNP plans/VBZ to/TO restructure/VB four/CD federal/JJ agencies/NNS including/VBG the/DT National/NNP Aeronautics/NNP and/CC Space/NNP Administration/NNP ,/, cutting/VBG a/DT total/NN of/IN some/DT five/CD thousand/CD positions/NNS from/IN the/DT government/NN payroll/NN to/TO save/VB more/JJR than/IN 13/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS over/IN five/CD years/NNS ./.

And/CC NASA/NNP administrator/NN Daniel/NNP Goldin/NNP was/VBD set/VBN to/TO announce/VB later/RB in/IN the/DT day/NN a/DT series/NN of/IN spending/NN cuts/NNS that/WDT would/MD slash/VB about/RB 2,000/CD jobs/NNS from/IN agency/NN payrolls/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN wipe/VB out/RP tens/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN related/JJ jobs/NNS at/IN contracting/NN companies/NNS ./.

Goldin/NNP and/CC Clinton/NNP were/VBD to/TO detail/NN the/DT plan/NN ,/, part/NN of/IN the/DT administration/NN 's/POS deficit-targetting/JJ ``/`` Reinventing/NNP Government/NNP ''/'' strategy/NN ,/, led/VBN by/IN Vice/NNP President/NNP Al/NNP Gore/NNP ./.

In/IN December/NNP ,/, five/CD other/JJ federal/JJ agencies/NNS committed/VBN to/TO slashing/VBG 20/CD billion/CD budgeted/VBN dollars/NNS ./.

NASA/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN paring/VBG its/PRP$ staff/NN ranks/NNS and/CC programs/NNS since/IN 1991/CD ,/, and/CC already/RB was/VBD to/TO see/VB a/DT five/CD billion/CD dollar/NN reduction/NN in/IN funding/VBG over/IN five/CD years/NNS ./.

Last/JJ month/NN ,/, it/PRP froze/VBD all/DT new/JJ hiring/NN ./.

It/PRP expects/VBZ to/TO have/VB 14.26/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS to/TO spend/VB in/IN 1996/CD ,/, including/VBG 5.5/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS for/IN shuttle/NN flights/NNS ./.

In/IN a/DT Washington/NNP Post/NNP article/NN Monday/NNP detailing/VBG plans/NNS for/IN the/DT budget/NN reductions/NNS ,/, Goldin/NNP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN gave/VBD his/PRP$ seal/NN of/IN approval/NN to/TO what/WP amounts/VBZ to/TO a/DT cultural/JJ revolution/NN in/IN space/NN exploration/NN and/CC research/NN :/: putting/VBG parts/NNS of/IN the/DT shuttle/NN business/NN on/IN the/DT auction/NN block/NN ./.

Private/JJ companies/NNS would/MD not/RB actually/RB own/VB the/DT shuttles/NNS ,/, but/CC private/JJ contractors/NNS would/MD bid/VB for/IN the/DT right/NN to/TO run/VB launches/NNS and/CC flight/NN operations/NNS ./.

Such/PDT a/DT bold/JJ stroke/NN ,/, if/IN surprising/JJ ,/, is/VBZ typical/JJ of/IN Goldin/NNP ,/, who/WP was/VBD named/VBN to/TO his/PRP$ post/NN by/IN former/JJ president/NN George/NNP Bush/NNP --/: one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ federal/JJ agency/NN administrators/NNP Clinton/NNP did/VBD not/RB replace/VB ./.

When/WRB Goldin/NNP first/RB came/VBD to/TO NASA/NNP in/IN early/JJ 1992/CD ,/, he/PRP made/VBD a/DT splash/NN by/IN moving/VBG swiftly/RB to/TO prove/VB that/IN the/DT agency/NN --/: known/VBN for/IN its/PRP$ big/JJ budgets/NNS --/: was/VBD ready/JJ to/TO streamline/VB ./.

He/PRP hyped/VBD the/DT idea/NN of/IN ``/`` faster/JJR ,/, cheaper/JJR ,/, smaller/JJR ''/'' arguing/VBG it/PRP was/VBD time/NN to/TO favor/VB small/JJ ,/, non-manned/JJ space/NN missions/NNS over/IN pricey/JJ shuttle/NN flights/NNS ./.

Two/CD launcher/NN systems/NNS that/WDT effectively/RB would/MD replace/VB shuttles/NNS ,/, the/DT X-33/NN and/CC X-34/NN ,/, are/VBP being/VBG studied/VBN ./.

They/PRP would/MD cost/VB about/RB 100/CD million/CD dollars/NNS ,/, instead/RB of/IN the/DT shuttles/NNS '/POS big-ticket/VBN 600/CD million/CD dollars/NNS ./.

Goldin/NNP told/VBD the/DT Post/NNP the/DT goal/NN was/VBD to/TO achieve/VB even/RB better/JJR flexibility/NN ,/, making/VBG it/PRP easier/RBR to/TO launch/VB new/JJ programs/NNS when/WRB necessary/JJ with/IN greater/JJR ease/NN ./.

NASA/NNP 's/POS administrator/NN also/RB has/VBZ an/DT undeniable/JJ political/JJ flair/NN :/: the/DT privatization/NN idea/NN has/VBZ been/VBN pushed/VBN by/IN House/NNP of/IN Representatives/NNP speaker/NN Newt/NNP Gingrich/NNP ,/, and/CC Goldin/NNP likely/RB would/MD prefer/VB organizing/VBG such/PDT an/DT operation/NN himself/PRP rather/RB than/IN face/VB the/DT Republican-run/NNP Congress/NNP '/POS own/JJ budget-busting/JJ handiwork/NN ./.
