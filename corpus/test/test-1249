U.N. to Hold Session on Elimination of Discrimination against Women
The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women
will convene the first of its two annual sessions here from January 19
to February 5, U.N. officials said on Friday.
The committee, the only U.N. human rights treaty-monitoring body
concerned exclusively with women, is expected to consider such issues
as the national development and modernization processes that fail to
address the needs of women and the detrimental effects of customary
practices, the officials said.
Comprised of 23 experts serving in their individual capacities, the
committee monitors the implementation of the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against women.
The Convention, often referred to as an international bill of rights
for women, sets up an agenda for national action to end discrimination.
It was adopted by the General Assembly in 1979 and entered into force
in 1981.
During the upcoming session, the committee will evaluate progress made
by seven parties to the treaty and formulate general recommendations on
eliminating gender discrimination.
Countries that have ratified or acceded to the Convention are legally
bound to put its provisions into effect. They are also committed to
submitting national reports on measures taken to comply with their
treaty obligations. An initial report is required within one year of
accession, and periodic reports at least every four years.
The U.N. Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Gender Issues and the
Advancement of Women, Angela King, is scheduled to open the session on
January 19.
