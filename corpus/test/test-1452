Turkey expects seven billion dollars from sale of power plants 
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan said on Monday that his government
expected to raise nearly seven billion dollars from the privatisation
of the country's power plants.
"We are going to privatise 16 thermal power plants and 19 hydraulic
power plants and part of the energy transmission network," Erbakan told
a news conference here.
"We are expecting to raise at least 6,875 billion dollars in this
process," he said.
Officials said foreign companies could also enter the privatisation
tenders.
Erbakan said the privatisation of the existing power plants would also
finance the construction of more than one dozen new power plants, a
deal worth nearly three billion dollars.
Islamist Premier Erbakan's government has launched an ambitious
privatisation programme since it took office in late June.
Parliament has already passed a law to sell part of the state-run
telecom company from which the government expects to raise more than 10
billion dollars over the next few years.
This year's sale of state-run companies has brought about only 300
million dollars, but the government's privatisation plan has targeted
eight billion dollars in 1997.
