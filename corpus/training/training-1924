FBI to probe handling of Ames spy scandal 
The FBI has opened an investigation to determine whether its agents
could have uncovered earlier confessed spy Aldrich Ames, FBI director
Louis Freeh was quoted Sunday as saying.
Freeh told the Washington Post that the investigation into the FBI's
handling of the case would be conducted much in the same manner as last
year's investigation at the CIA.
Sources from the Federal Bureau of Investigation said they would
examine why Ames had unauthorized meetings with then Soviet foreign
ministry arms control expert Sergei Chuvakhin.
Ames was sentenced last year to life in prison for selling secrets to
the Kremlin for almost nine years in the worst security breach in US
history.
