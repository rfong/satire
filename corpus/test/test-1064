Sampras walks into semi-finals
World number one Pete Sampras advanced to the semi-finals of the ATP Lipton
Championships here Wednesday by a walkover after Germany's Hendrik
Dreekmann injured his right ankle.
Sampras has reached the semi-finals of the 2.45 million-dollar event
for the fifth consecutive year. He will face either Ukrainian Andrei
Medvedev or Spain's Sergi Bruguera on Friday for a berth in Sunday's
final.
Dreekmann, ranked 54th, was walking back to his Miami hotel Tuesday
night after dinner when he tripped over an uneven spot in the pavement.
"It was really dark and I didn't see the bump," Dreekman said. "I knew
it was bad as soon as I fell to the ground."
Dreekmann, 22, iced his ankle overnight and was examined here Wednesday
before departing on crutches for X-rays instead of preparing for his
second quarter-final of 1997. He lost to Thomas Enqvist in Marseille
last month.
