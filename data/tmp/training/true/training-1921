Hunger/NN crisis/NN casts/VBZ large/JJ shadow/NN over/IN Zimbabwean/JJ elections/NNS One/CD year/NN ago/RB ,/, Mrs./NNP Ndlovu/NNP 's/POS fields/NNS were/VBD ripe/JJ with/IN melons/NNS ,/, pumpkins/NNS and/CC corn/NN ./.

More/RBR importantly/RB ,/, she/PRP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO get/VB mealie/JJ meal/NN --/: finely/RB ground/VBN corn/NN used/VBN to/TO make/VB sadza/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ an/DT almost/RB sacred/JJ place/NN in/IN the/DT Zimbabwean/JJ diet/NN ./.

This/DT year/NN ,/, her/PRP$ fields/NNS in/IN southern/JJ Zimbabwe/NNP are/VBP scorched/VBN by/IN drought/NN ./.

Economic/JJ mismanagement/NN and/CC the/DT collapse/NN of/IN commercial/JJ farming/NN have/VBP left/VBN the/DT store/NN shelves/NNS empty/JJ ./.

So/IN Ndlovu/NNP ,/, who/WP was/VBD unwilling/JJ to/TO give/VB her/PRP$ first/JJ name/NN ,/, has/VBZ had/VBN to/TO seek/VB help/NN from/IN the/DT World/NNP Food/NNP Program/NN -LRB-/-LRB- WFP/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, the/DT UN/NNP agency/NN that/WDT has/VBZ mounted/VBN a/DT massive/JJ relief/NN operation/NN to/TO feed/VB more/JJR than/IN half/PDT a/DT million/CD people/NNS facing/VBG starvation/NN in/IN a/DT country/NN that/WDT was/VBD once/RB a/DT regional/JJ breadbasket/NN ./.

The/DT hunger/NN crisis/NN has/VBZ become/VBN one/CD of/IN the/DT main/JJ issues/NNS in/IN t/NN the/DT bush/NN to/TO survive/VB ./.

To/TO feed/VB her/PRP$ children/NNS ,/, Ndlovu/NNP said/VBD she/PRP makes/VBZ a/DT drink/NN from/IN the/DT sap/NN of/IN amarula/NN trees/NNS ,/, picks/VBZ mopane/JJ worms/NNS and/CC beans/NNS for/IN protein/NN ,/, and/CC sometimes/RB finds/VBZ some/DT wild/JJ fruit/NN that/IN she/PRP dries/VBZ and/CC serves/VBZ with/IN water/NN ./.

She/PRP has/VBZ four/CD chickens/NNS ,/, but/CC no/DT other/JJ livestock/NN ./.

While/IN the/DT drought/NN in/IN southern/JJ Zimbabwe/NNP is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS immediate/JJ cause/NN of/IN Ndlovu/NNP 's/POS problems/NNS ,/, the/DT government/NN 's/POS mismanagement/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN and/CC its/PRP$ controversial/JJ land/NN reforms/NNS have/VBP made/VBN the/DT food/NN shortage/NN a/DT national/JJ problem/NN ,/, even/RB in/IN cities/NNS ./.

National/NNP grain/NN reserves/NNS are/VBP empty/JJ ./.

The/DT harvest/NN in/IN April/NNP is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO fall/VB at/IN least/JJS 600,000/CD tonnes/NNS short/RB of/IN the/DT nation/NN 's/POS needs/NNS ./.

Commercial/JJ farms/NNS ,/, owned/VBN mainly/RB by/IN white/JJ Zimbabweans/NNS ,/, have/VBP fallen/VBN idle/JJ since/IN the/DT government/NN targetted/VBD most/JJS of/IN that/DT land/NN for/IN resettlement/NN by/IN blacks/NNS ./.

Militant/JJ backers/NNS of/IN President/NNP Robert/NNP Mugabe/NNP forcibly/RB occupied/VBD many/JJ of/IN the/DT white-owned/JJ farms/NNS two/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, effectively/RB blocking/VBG white/JJ farmers/NNS from/IN plowing/VBG their/PRP$ fields/NNS ./.

Despite/IN warnings/NNS of/IN a/DT hunger/NN crisis/NN as/RB early/RB as/IN one/CD year/NN ago/RB ,/, Zimbabwe/NNP 's/POS government/NN spent/VBD months/NNS adamantly/RB denying/VBG the/DT food/NN shortage/NN ./.

When/WRB the/DT government/NN finally/RB swallowed/VBN its/PRP$ pride/NN and/CC asked/VBN for/IN international/JJ help/NN ,/, the/DT WFP/NN responded/VBD with/IN an/DT appeal/NN for/IN 60/CD million/CD dollars/NNS to/TO feed/VB more/JJR than/IN 558,000/CD people/NNS --/: a/DT huge/JJ number/NN in/IN a/DT nation/NN that/WDT normally/RB feeds/VBZ itself/PRP and/CC exports/VBZ its/PRP$ surplus/NN grain/NN around/IN the/DT region/NN ./.

Zimbabwe/NNP has/VBZ not/RB needed/VBN international/JJ food/NN aid/NN for/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ people/NNS since/IN 1992/CD ,/, when/WRB a/DT massive/JJ droughporters/VBZ ,/, has/VBZ slowed/VBN the/DT food/NN relief/NN ./.

Aid/NNP agencies/NNS managed/VBD to/TO hand/VB out/RP one-month/JJ rations/NNS of/IN mealie/JJ meal/NN in/IN only/RB two/CD districts/NNS before/IN deciding/VBG to/TO suspend/VB their/PRP$ distributions/NNS for/IN two/CD weeks/NNS over/IN security/NN concerns/NNS ./.

Even/RB the/DT few/JJ distributions/NNS that/WDT did/VBD take/VB place/NN had/VBD to/TO be/VB scheduled/VBN around/IN political/JJ rallies/NNS ./.

While/IN rural/JJ Zimbabweans/NNPS are/VBP faced/VBN with/IN the/DT most/RBS minimal/JJ options/NNS for/IN food/NN ,/, city/NN dwellers/NNS are/VBP also/RB suffering/VBG from/IN the/DT mealie/JJ meal/NN shortage/NN ./.

Few/JJ people/NNS can/MD afford/VB other/JJ grains/NNS ./.

Rice/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, costs/VBZ more/JJR than/IN 10/CD times/NNS as/IN much/JJ as/IN mealie/JJ meal/NN ./.

WFP/NNP dieticians/NNS estimate/VBP that/IN on/IN average/NN ,/, Zimbabweans/NNP get/VBP 60/CD percent/NN of/IN their/PRP$ energy/NN requirements/NNS from/IN sadza/NN ,/, the/DT thick/JJ porridge/NN made/VBN from/IN mealie/JJ meal/NN ./.

Without/IN mealie/JJ meal/NN ,/, and/CC no/DT other/JJ starch/NN to/TO replace/VB it/PRP ,/, a/DT person/NN 's/POS body/NN will/MD start/VB to/TO feed/VB on/IN itself/PRP ,/, and/CC malnutrition/NN sets/VBZ in/RP ./.

The/DT hunger/NN problem/NN is/VBZ compounded/VBN by/IN the/DT high/JJ incidence/NN of/IN HIV/NN ,/, which/WDT infects/VBZ at/IN least/JJS one/CD in/IN four/CD adult/JJ Zimbabweans/NNS ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ./.

Poor/NNP nutrition/NNP leaves/VBZ people/NNS with/IN HIV/NN more/RBR susceptible/JJ to/TO the/DT disease/NN and/CC to/TO other/JJ infections/NNS ./.

In/IN his/PRP$ rallies/NNS ,/, Mugabe/NNP has/VBZ tried/VBN to/TO assure/VB voters/NNS that/IN the/DT government/NN is/VBZ working/VBG to/TO bring/VB in/IN more/JJR food/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN mealie/JJ meal/NN has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN short/JJ supply/NN for/IN more/JJR than/IN two/CD months/NNS ./.

Opposition/NNP leader/NN Morgan/NNP Tsvangirai/NNP has/VBZ used/VBN the/DT food/NN crisis/NN to/TO criticize/VB the/DT government/NN ,/, but/CC seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB counting/VBG on/IN international/JJ aid/NN and/CC a/DT restoration/NN of/IN at/IN least/JJS some/DT commercial/JJ farming/NN ,/, if/IN he/PRP wins/VBZ ,/, to/TO end/VB the/DT nation/NN 's/POS hunger/NN ./.

Whether/IN scared/JJ by/IN the/DT political/JJ violence/NN or/CC just/RB hungry/JJ ,/, few/JJ recipients/NNS of/IN the/DT food/NN aid/NN said/VBD the/DT election/NN 's/POS outcome/NN would/MD change/VB their/PRP$ lives/NNS ./.
