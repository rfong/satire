Russia's Federation Council orders crime investigation 
Russia's upper house of parliament ordered Thursday an investigation
into the country's burgeoning crime wave, the ITAR-TASS news agency
reported.
Citing the absence of a "system capable of protecting civilian's rights
or freedoms," the Federation Council is to begin taking evidence on the
"fight against crime and the reinforcement of law and order," the
agency reported.
Russia's prosecutor general, Yuri Skuratov, warned that crime,
particularly that of an economic nature, is out of control. Skuratov
said the country was flooded with some 1.5 million illegal weapons.
The former Soviet Union is saddled with a major crime wave that has
taken root in the wake of the collapse of the former Soviet system.
Corruption, extortion and violence have become part of everyday life in
Russia where once crime officially did not exist.
Elsewhere, a Council of Europe study published Thursday in Strasbourg
said Russia had the highest rate of detention of all the Council's 40
member nations, with 694 people in prison for every 100,000 head of
population.
Comparable rates among European Union states are around 90 people per
100,000, the study revealed. Slovenia, the former Yugoslavia republic
has the lowest detention rate of 24 per 100,000 the study reported.
