177 Foreign Companies Operate in S.Africa in 1995 
A total of 177 foreign companies established businesses in south africa
in 1995, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said today.
Responding to a question during a senate debate in Cape Town, Erwin
said 90 of these companies are financial or similar institutions, while
47 are trading companies.
Other sectors in which foreign companies began doing business are
manufacturing, construction, transport, mining, agriculture and
community service, said the minister.
Erwin said the registrar of companies, which kept details of these
companies, did not have records of the exact amount of money they had
brought into the country.
However, figures from the Reserve Bank indicated that the total inflow
of all foreign investment came to 21.7 billion Rand (about 4 billion
U.S.Dollars) in 1995, up from 1.25 billion U.S.Dollars in 1994.
