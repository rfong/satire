Lawmakers Call for Tighter Supervision of Customs (2)
He went on to say that according to the draft, customs officers are
subject to supervision by prosecutors, but a customs officer may cover
regions under the jurisdiction of different procuratorates.
"The existing draft also fails to clarify which procuratorate should be
responsible for the judicial surveillance," he said.
"Customs are an important government body that ensures sound economic
order for the country," said another lawmaker, Zhang Haoruo, noting
that "if they do not behave well, they may bring about great losses, as
proved by experience."
He proposed that customs heads should be regularly inspected by
prosecutors or government disciplinary bodies, and important
customhouses should be audited periodically too.
Other lawmakers said that there should be a separate chapter in the law
specifying measures to monitor the behavior of heads of customs, for
instance publicizing the list of the cargo he or she passes each day.
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, attended today 's
debate on the customs law.
