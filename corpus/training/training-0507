Andrew Meyer is no Mychal Bell
This tasing incident reminds me of another unjust brutality story, but
instead of the victim being a stoner motivated away from his cheese
puffs and Capri Suns (the newer, easier-to-insert-the-straw ones) to
sprout secret society conspiracy theories, the victims in this other
case were defending themselves after being threatened with a noose and
a shotgun.
Nooses are so terrible, the mere sight of a loop makes me furiously
pound on my keyboard like this: ghsrgjkl;fnhfwojtg (That semicolon
suggests my rage can't be restricted to the QWERTY letter
configuration).
A shotgun has the capacity to end life, whereas a conspiracy theory
does not. Unless that conspiracy is the one that killed MLK, or the
conspiracy to stab me in the chest, or more elaborately, the one by
Steffi Graf to stab Monica Seles in the chest.
Let's be honest here, the only reason Taser kid is getting coverage is
because the story comes with a YouTube video of the tasing included
whereas my Jena Six does not. Well if you pay attention to me, I'll
throw in a YouTube vid of me peeing on dead things.
