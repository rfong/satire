Mills is booted off US dance show, leg stays to go into next round.
Heather Mills is a bit miffed to say the least; the poor monoped has
been having a tough time of things of late despite her trying to
ingratiate herself to the general public by entering arse kicking
contests and dancing competitions.
Yesterday came the final straw. The 39-year-old and her dance partner
Jonathan Roberts made it to the sixth week of the knock-out competition
but have now been told to hop it.
The former fluffer said she was not surprised to be voted off and had a
farewell speech hidden inside her jockstrap.
The judges ranked Mills and Roberts fifth out of the seven remaining
pairs on Tuesday's show on the ABC network, but she was shocked to hear
the surprise announcement that her prosthetic leg was to be sent
through to the next round with it's own dancing partner as Ironically,
and perhaps not coincidentally, it was her upper rather than her lower
body movements that were singled out by the judges as being too wooden.
The next round of the hit TV show Dancing with the Stars, the US
version of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing will have "the leg" busting
some moves and throwing shapes with Mickey Rooneys hair piece.
Wiggy and leggy, the prosthetic golden couple will be taking to the
floor with a demonstration of Capoeira, a unique Afro-Brazilian blend
of dance, acrobatics, music, song and self defence.
Lets cut a rug baby!
