Little Possibility for Faster Economic Growth Globally in 2001: Chinese Economists 
Despite the fastest growth in years in 2000, the world economy is
unlikely to scale new heights in 2001, Chinese economists predict.
This is because the factors contributing to the economic boom this year
will gradually weaken, thus reducing the growth momentum of the world
economy to a normal speed next year, according to forecasts made by the
economists in a book to be published soon.
The book, titled "2000--2001: World Economy Analyses and Predictions",
presents a macro-outlook of the world's economic situation at the turn
of the century.
Co-written by several dozen senior Chinese economists, this annual
economic report is also known as "World Economy Yellow Paper".
The global economic growth rate this year is expected to hit 4. 1
percent, a sharp increase from 2.8 percent last year, and both the
developed and the developing countries have witnessed notable economic
growth, according to the book.
Global trade volume is forecast to grow a year-on-year 12.2 percent in
2000, the highest growth rate within the past two decades.
As the major force propelling the development of the world economy,
America's economy has witnessed a slowdown.
On Europe, the yellow paper says, "Taking into account the fact that
the European Central Bank has adopted a policy of improving interest
rates, we could not expect the next year's economic development pace in
the Euro region to exceed this year."
The book also details essential factors that may possibly slow down the
economic development of East Asia (except for Japan) and Russia.
Based upon the analysis over each economic region, the yellow paper
draws the conclusion that the world economy will be back to the normal
track next year.
It says that there still exist many uncertainties in the world economy,
and the possibility of sudden economic upheavals cannot be ruled out.
