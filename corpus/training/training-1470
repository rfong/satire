African Day of Industrialization Marked in Cameroon
The Cameroonian government has decided to encourage private initiative
in the creation of small and medium sized enterprises as the most
important aspect of its industrialization drive, a senior official said
today.
Minister of Trade and Industry Justin Ndioro made the statement this
morning in Yaounde during the commemoration of the 8th African Day of
Industrialization.
The day is celebrated this year under the theme "social economic impact
of small and medium sized enterprises on the life of the people of
Africa."
The African Industrialization Day was instituted in 1990 by the United
Nations. The day November 20 was chosen to promote the development of
industries in all the countries in Africa.
The minister noted that the creation of small and medium sized
enterprises in Africa provides the best solution to unemployment and at
the same time such enterprises can easily be managed and can be created
in both rural and urban areas.
The minister said the government of Cameroon has taken a series of
measures to facilitate the creation of small and medium sized
enterprises, especially with structures like the National Employment
Fund and the Trade and Industry Special Program in this domain.
The minister seized the opportunity to launch the fifth edition of the
National Handicraft Day, adding that handicraft is the first step
toward industrialization in Cameroon.
