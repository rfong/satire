French election lays bare failings of Arab integration
Some five million French men and women are of Arab origin, but the
community can boast not a single member of parliament -- and despite
mounting criticism of France's policies of integration, the situation
is unlikely to change after this month's general election.
Following the presidential election breakthrough of far-right leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen -- and with crime and unemployment among France's
North African minority problems now universally recognised -- there is
a growing feeling that the lack of representation is an unacceptable
anomaly.
Not only are none of the 577 deputies in the National Assembly from the
so-called "beur" population, but neither are any members of the upper
house, the Senate, nor any of the country's 36,000 elected mayors.
"It is shameful for France," said Zair Kedadouche, an adviser in the
mid-90s to centre-right prime minister Alain Juppe who has written a
new book entitled, "France and the beurs."
"I am ashamed every time I go to Britain or the US. When I tell people
there that such a huge minority has no political representatives they
are dumbstruck. And France is the country that presumes to hand out
lessons to the world!" he said.
In the two-round parliamentary election that takes place on Sundays
June 9 and 16, a rough tally shows that around 150 of more than 8,400
candidates are of Arab origin - but most of these are from minor
parties and practically none has a realistic chance of winning through.
Of the two main parties, the Socialists have selected only two
candidates of North African origin -- "a scandal", according to one of
them Bariza Khiari -- while the centre-right Union for the Presidential
Majority (UMP) has chosen only one.
According to Khiari, "There are many brilliant young people from
immigrant families but they are consistently overlooked. Sometimes it's
at the grass-roots level that their paths are blocked, but it's also
the national leadership that is failing to take them on."
The effect of this exclusion is universally acknowledged to be highly
damaging.
Communities already physically marginalised in the high-rise suburbs of
major towns feel psychologically marginalised as well -- and the
behaviour patterns are thus reinforced which help confirm the far-right
in its criticisms of the immigrants' culture of alienation, dependency
and crime.
"It is as if we can do anything -- sport, entertainment, music -- but
not politics. That's off-limits," said Kedadouche, who is of Algerian
parents.
But if the problem has been thoroughly diagnosed, the one expedient
that would start to solve it -- a deliberate policy of promoting beurs
-- is excluded because it offends against France's republican
traditions of universal equality.
So while in Britain the government of Tony Blair now includes four
black people -- and Asian, African and Caribbean faces are common-place
in the media -- France refuses to adopt a policy of "positive
discrimination" on the grounds that it is in itself a form of racism.
"The French have a deep-rooted abhorrence of communities," explained
sociologist Michel Wieviorka. "So promoting on the basis of skin colour
will never be acceptable. But I think we have to move to a greater
acknowledgement of the complexity of people's sense of identity."
According to Kedadouche, France has pursued too long a policy towards
its immigrant communities that is laudable in theory, because it
genuinely seeks to treat individuals as equal, but atrocious in its
effects -- because in practice it has not worked.
"The French see everything through a theoretical framework. It is all
conceptual. We have got to start dealing with reality," he said.
That start has already been made. Following Jacques Chirac's reelection
as president last month, Tokia Saifi was made minister for sustainable
development in the new centre-right government, becoming the first ever
cabinet member of North African origin.
According to many beurs, there is disappointment in the community at
the broken promises of the Socialists -- which used to be their natural
party of choice. And the nomination of Saifi has been widely welcomed
as a potent symbol of change.
