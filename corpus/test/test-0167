Canada welcomes US-EU accord on resolving Cuba dispute 
Canada welcomed Friday an agreement between the United States and the
European Union to ease tensions over the US Helms-Burton law aimed at
choking off foreign investment in Cuba.
International Trade Minister Art Eggleton said the agreement between
Brussels and Washington would suspend the EU complaint before the World
Trade Organization and transfer the dispute to the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The United States had said previously that it would not accept a WTO
verdict in the dispute.
"What they are doing," Eggleton told reporters, "is moving it over to
the OECD under a process origination by Canada ... That's a good, solid
move."
This is a reference to an OECD dispute procedure over international
rules on access to investment. The OECD embraces virtually all of the
world's industrialized nations.
But Eggleton also noted that a ban on visits to the United States by
some foreign businesmen, including some Canadians, would not be lifted
-- although it would not be extended to any other businessmen.
And he pointed out that the continued rolling six-month exemption to
Title III of Helms-Burton, allowing US companies and citizens to sue
foreigners benefitting from property expropriated by Cuba from US
investors, could only be guaranteed for the remainder of US President
Bill Clinton's term of office.
Nevertheless, Eggleton said: "The one achievement (of the
Brussels-Washington agreement) is getting it into another forum where
the Americans will participate.
"This is the best breakthrough we have had."
But Eggleton warned that if the OECD process did not work to Canada's
satisfaction, "I still have a NAFTA process in my back pocket."
Canada has repeatedly threatened to use a disputes process within the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if the Americans refused to
comply with a WTO ruling.
