J-League sees worst ever match attendance
The J-League saw it worst ever match attendance record on Wednesday, on
only the second day of competition since it kicked off its fifth season
last week.
Only 3,057 spectators came to the Ichihara stadium near Tokyo to watch
a game between JEF United Ichihara and Kyoto Purple Sanga, breaking the
previous worst of 4,491 set in November last year in Hiroshima.
Overall attendances continued to drop with the average last season
falling to 13,353, down from 16,922 in 1995 and 19,598 in 1994.
The drop has also meant a fall in television audiences and revenue.
Despite becoming the worst attended game ever, the match did see a
reversal of fortunes for Purple Sanga, who won 4-2 after going last
season for 17 straight games without a win, the worst record in the
league.
In other matches Gamba Osaka and Yokohama Flugels coasted to a second
straight win each to lead the league with six points, followed by
Jubilo Iwata with five points.
Patrick Mboma, the first player from Cameroon to play in Japan, scored
a goal in the 51st minute, his second in two games, to help Gamba to a
4-0 victory over 1995 champions Yokohama Marinos.
The Flugels were 2-0 winners over Cerezo Osaka thanks to Brazilian
midfielder Valber's two goals in the 74th and 80th minutes.
Jubilo defeated Avispa Fukuoka 1-0 also for a second consecutive win,
but they gained only two points as it was a win in extra-time.
The Brazilians dominated Kashiwa Reysol's 3-2 win over Sanfrecce
Hiroshima with Edilson scoring two goals and Jamelli one.
Verdy Kawasaki whitewashed Bellmare Hiratsuka 2-0, Urawa Red Diamonds
edged past Shimizu S-Pulse 1-0, while newcomers Vissel Kobe posted
their first win in the J-League by beating Nagoya Grampus Eight 2-1.
