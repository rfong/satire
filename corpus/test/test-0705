China's Internet Economy to Expand in 21st Century: Experts (2)
On the basis of international cooperation, the country should continue
to develop its own intellectual property and standards for building an
information infrastructure for its economy.
"China can take a distinctive road to create its own information system
which conforms to international practice," Liu stressed.
Duan Yongji, president of the Stone Group, a Beijng-based information
technology enterprise, held that the new economy characterized by
information, knowledge and the Internet will eventually need new rules
of governance.
It will also provide a chance for "re-shuffling," Duan said. As long as
China seizes the opportunities, it will gradually shorten the distance
between its existing capabilities and advanced levels.
Duan also called on the information industry businesses to sort out the
structural flaws and establish a scientific business management system.
In his speech to the conference, Richard Li, chairman of the Hong Kong
Pacific Century Group, noted that human resources will play a vital
role in future competitions.
It's very encouraging that the Chinese government has begun to
implement its strategy of revitalizing the nation through science,
technology and education, he said.
This, along with the liberalization in the telecommunications sector
and reform measures to encourage competition, will benefit the
development of China's Internet economy, he noted.
