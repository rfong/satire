Leeson gets six-and-a-half years in jail 
Rogue financial trader Nick Leeson was sentenced to six-and-a-half
years in prison after a swift trial Saturday for violating Singapore's
laws in covering up the losses that sank Britain's Barings bank.
The sentence, for two cheating offences, was retroactive to March 2,
when Leeson was arrested in Germany after fleeing Singapore, where he
placed the disastrous futures bets that broke Britain's oldest merchant
bank in lazte February.
The term fell short of the maximum eight years Leeson stood to receive
after his conviction Friday.
The whole trial process, from the time Leeson was brought into court on
Friday to his sentencing, took little more than 24 hours.
The 28-year-old Briton had pleaded guilty to two cheating offences on
Friday under a plea bargain with financial police that saw nine other
charges being dropped and the maximum sentence slashed from 14 to eight
years.
Leeson, dressed in a dark suit as he stood in the dock while listening
to the sentence, chewed his lower lip in nervousness and swallowed hard
while the sentence was being read by senior district judge Richard
Magnus.
Leeson had confessed to cheating auditors for his company, Baring
Futures (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., and the Singapore International Monetary
Exchange (SIMEX).
Magnus sentenced Leeson to six months for deceiving the auditors into
believing that a Wall Street firm had remitted 7.77 billion yen (77.7
million US dollars) into his company's Citibank account here.
He gave Leeson six years for cheating SIMEX into releasing some 115
million US dollars to Baring Futures as a refund for excess margins
that did not exist.
Magnus told a courtroom packed with journalists that "it is well
recognized that the basic concept of punishment should be in accordance
with the crime."
He said Leeson was "in a position of trust in Baring Futures and the
facts showed the accused had a direct hand in various matters including
dealings with the auditors and SIMEX," and had "spun a web of deceit."
"He had used that position (of trust) to trade his honesty and his
integrity," the judge added.
Defence lawyer John Koh said before the hearing that there was a
likelihood of appeal.
Prosecutors declined comment after the sentencing.
