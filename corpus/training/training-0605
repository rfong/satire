Sri Lanka Issues Cholera Warning 
Sri Lanka's health authorities Monday issued a cholera warning and
cautioned the public to take all necessary steps to prevent an
island-wide epidemic.
The authorities said the incidence of cholera had reached an alarming
level in Polonnaruwa District in North Central Province and Puttalam
District in North Western Province and there is the possibility of a
spillover to other areas with the onset of the monsoon rains.
At least 10 persons have died of cholera so far and scores of others
are being treated at hospitals in the two regions. It is reported that
more than 100 suspected cholera cases were under medical attention and
31 positive cases had been identified and the patients had been
admitted to hospitals.
Health officials have said proper drinking water and sanitary
facilities are of vital importance for curbing cholera.
A health education team and para-medical personnel have been despatched
from Colombo to the affected areas to help bring the situation under
control.
