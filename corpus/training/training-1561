U.N. Leader Calls for Efforts to Narrow Digital Divide in World
The appeal was contained in a message by Harri Holkeri, president of
the U.N. General Assembly, to mark the World Telecommunication Day,
which falls on May 17 annually.
"The Internet epitomizes today's globalized world, but we should be
reminded that it is available only to a minority: 5 percent of the
world's population -- and of that figure, only 15 percent are in
developing countries," Holkeri said.
"To overcome the obvious disparities between people's access to the
information superhighway, countries need to develop solid basic
infrastructures and the political will to support investment in new
technologies," he said.
"The Internet could help in providing some of the services of
traditional infrastructures," he said. "The principles of coherence,
complementarity and cooperation between old and new technologies should
be observed in designing integrated approaches to telecommunications in
the globalized world."
The theme for this year's International Telecommunication Day is "the
Internet: Challenges, Opportunities and Prospects."
In 1968, the International Telecommunication Union decided to designate
May 17, on which the U.N. agency was established, as the International
Telecommunication Day. U.N. member states began to celebrate the
international day every year since 1969.
