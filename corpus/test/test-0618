German press sees controversy in Bush visit 
President George W. Bush's visit to Berlin comes amid growing
scepticism of US foreign policy despite close ties between the two
countries, the German press commented on Tuesday.
"When the US president arrives in Berlin, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder will welcome him with open arms," the Berliner Zeitung
newspaper said.
"But most Germans will be sceptical about proceedings and tens of
thousands of them will hit the streets in protest against Washington's
policies," it said.
"Never has a president of the United States been so foreign to us and
never have German citizens been so sceptical about the policies of
their most powerful of allies."
Anti-war and other groups have said they will demonstrate during Bush's
visit on Wednesday and Thursday, when he is expected to seek support
for possible military strikes against Iraq.
In an editorial entitled: "A cumbersome friendship", the conservative
daily Die Welt said: "Almost no nation more than Germany cried so
emotionally with the Americans after the September 11 attacks."
"And in no other European country are protests of such size being
anticipated against the visit of George W. Bush," it said.
"Apparently, Germans see no contradiction between compassion and
vigorous protest. The German people's relationship with the United
States resembles relations with a close friend with whom one constantly
argues," it said.
The German capital's left-wing Tageszeitung headlines in English with:
"Mr Bush, tear down this wall!" a reference to Ronald Reagan's call to
Moscow in 1987 to bring down the Berlin Wall.
For the newspaper though, the United States is acting in isolation,
"deciding between war and peace, the global environment and human
rights without taking the rest of the world into consideration."
