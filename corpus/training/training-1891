Debate on the law went for 19 hours over two days and involved 59 speakers
from both sides of parliament during the first all night weekend sitting.
The decision came as protest rallies and meetings against tougher gun
laws continued around the country.
In Hobart, near Port Arthur where the massacre occurred, thousands of
supporters of tougher gun-controls led by politicians from Tasmania's
three major political parties began the day of action with a march
through the city streets.
But an even bigger crowd of gun-owners descended on Hobart from around
Tasmania for the launch of a new pro-shooters' national political
party, the Australia First Reform Party, and to protest against the
tough new gun laws introduced into the Tasmanian parliament on Friday.
