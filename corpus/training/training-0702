Junior workers of Nigeria's biggest newspaper company on strike 
Hundreds of junior workers of the pro-government Daily Times press
group, Africa's largest and oldest newspaper company, have begun an
indefinite strike to press for increased salary and better conditions
of service, a source close to the company said here Friday.
The strike, which began Thursday, affects mostly workers at the
headquarters of the company in Agidingbi, Ikeja, in the northern
outskirts of Lagos.
The strike has already affected production in the company, established
70 years ago, the source said.
As a result of the downing of tools, Friday's edition of the Daily
Times newspaper was produced in another company here, the source added.
The edition, whose printing quality is very poor, has only 24 pages
instead of the usual 32 or more pages. The reduction in size is likely
to continue as long as the strike lasts, the source said.
The Daily Times group, which had about a dozen different publications,
was forced last year to reduce them to only four due to financial
difficulties.
An official in the company, who demanded anonymity, told AFP that
efforts were being made to address the problems of the striking workers
so that they could return to work soon.
The federal government owns 60 percent of the shares in the Daily Times
group.
