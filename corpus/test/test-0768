Huntington Has Pictures To Go With Blake's Words
You may have read his poetry in a paperback during high school or
college, but chances are you've never seen the illustrations that were
supposed to accompany them.
That's because William Blake's richly illustrated poems are so rare and
fragile that only the most diligent of scholars usually can see them.
But ``William Blake's Illuminated Prints,'' opening today at the
Huntington Library in San Marino, presents the 18th-century Eng
They show how Blake not only printed his own poems celebrating the
creative impulse and unconventionality, but dressed them up with
equally unique illustrations of cherubs, invented landscapes and
mythological beings.
``He believed his illuminated manuscripts should be seen whole,'' said
Robert N. Essick, a prominent Blake scholar and the exhibit's curator.
``He saw them as composite works of art.''
The rare look into visionary poet who believed he was divinely
inspired, but may have just been crazy, is being billed as one of the
highlights of the ongoing U.K./L.A. festival, which spotlights English
culture, especially as it relates to Los Angeles.
``William Blake's Illuminated Prints'' also marks the 75th anniversary
the Huntington Library, whose bibliophile founder, Henry E. Huntington,
started what today is considered the world's most comprehensive Blake
collection, spanning watercolors, prints and wildly illustrated
collections of poetry.
``It's one of the biggest exhibits ever of Blake's illustrations,''
said Essick, an English professor at the University of California,
Riverside.
Blake's illustrations may have taken a back seat to his poetry over the
years, but he was passionate about them.
In fact, he originally wanted to be an artist, but his father dismissed
the idea as impractical, pushing him instead into printing. He only
began writing poetry after beginning to print the works of other poets.
A small circle of artists discovered Blake in the last decade of his
life, but he lived most of life in a painful obscurity, with only his
wife, who helped color his illustrations, believing in his efforts.
``In his letters he said he'd been in darkness and gone through hell,''
Essick said.
In fact, Blake may have illustrated his poetry as a marketing device
for the less accessible poetry, but they were more than a gimmick.
Blake scholars and fans -- including ``Where the Wild Things Are''
creator Maurice Sendak -- find rich parallels between the illustrations
and the poems, Essick said.
Blake didn't use the same technique as the illustrators of his day, who
favored laborious etchings, every step of which had to be planned
carefully in advance.
Blake developed a technique that allowed him to paint directly onto the
metal plate from which the books were printed. The process, which
anticipated lithography, allowed him to create the images
extemporaneously -- much the same way he wrote.
``Blake's writing is very spirited and energetic,'' Essick said. ``Some
of the illustrations retain this spirit.''
But art historians have not always given Blake his due. While some
consider him third only to the great British landscape artists Joseph
Turner and John Constable, others dismiss his art as crude and awkward.
``I hope you work on the poetry, not those awful pictures,'' art
historians have told Essick, an Altadena resident who is a visiting
professor this year at California Institute of Technology.
But where some have seen a lack of technical mastery, Essick sees an
early modernist who favored expressiveness and simplicity over dogged
representationalism. In fact, Essick compares Blake with the modern
masters Paul Cezanne and Pablo Picasso.
Ironically, Huntington probably wasn't much of a fan of Blake's art,
either. It's not known exactly what Huntington thought of Blake, but
Essick believes the bibliophile probably was more interested in the
author's near obsessive involvement in every phase of his books.
``Never was a man so completely the author of his own books,'' Essick
said.
Yet even this claim to fame was overlooked by Blake's first real
champions -- a generation of literary critics who came of age right
after World War II.
It wasn't until the late 1960s and early '70s that interest blossomed
in the illustrations, in which members of the counterculture found
parallels to their own mistrust of materialistic values as well as a
celebration of altered states of consciousness.
``I've had people say they've taken this or that drug and had visions
similar to Blake's illustrations,'' said Essick.
While the drug takers believed the similarities demonstrate a psychic
connection between them and Blake, Essick thinks any correlations
between the states of mind were more prosaic. He thinks anyone whose
drug-induced visions resembled Blake's imaginary landscapes with
mythological beings of his own invention probably had seen the
illustrations before they took the drugs.
Nonetheless, Blake has numerous counterculture fans, including early
LSD advocate Timothy Leary and beat poet Allen Ginsberg.
``Blake was the catalytic poet who turned me on to the idea that poetry
could awaken people's consciousness,'' Ginsberg writes in the liner
notes for ``Holy Soul Jelly Roll,'' a new collection of his writings on
Compact Disc.
Pharmacological correlations aren't the only rich relationships held in
the the illustrations, which sometimes run parallel, sometimes contrary
to the text.
Take the 1793 illustration for ``Visions of the Daughter of Albion,'' a
poem that takes a surprisingly modern look at an age-old theme -- a
woman's rape and her boyfriend's unsympathetic reaction. In what art
historians have seen as a brilliant psychological portrait of the
poem's main characters, the illustration shows the victim and the
rapist bound together, somehow unable to let go of each other. The
rapist opens his mouth in a scream -- perhaps in the horror of what he
has done or the retribution that awaits him, Essick said. Meanwhile,
the self-involved boyfriend buries his head.
``Think about how many made-for-TV-movies have been on this theme,''
Essick said.
The parallels are less neat in ``The Tyger,'' Blake's most famous poem
and perhaps the most anthologized poem in the English language. Essick
said the 1795 poem, which appeared in the second half of ``Songs of
Innocence and of Experience,'' has been interpreted as a criticism of
people who view nature as a terrifying force and therefore have a
similar view of God. Yet the tiger, which in the poem represents the
frightening view of nature, actually looks like a pussy cat, Essick
pointed out.
A popular explanation is that Blake wasn't technically proficient
enough to portray a fierce tiger, a theory Essick discounts. A more
likely explanation, he believes, is that the tiger represented the more
benign view of nature -- and God -- that Blake wanted to promote.
Yet a third explanation, which is illustrated in the exhibit, is that
the tiger is happy because of his proximity to the subject of ``The
Lamb'' -- a companion poem that actually appeared at the beginning of
the book. Because the book was unbound, the two poems are displayed
side-by-side, opening the door to this possibility.
``The joke is the tiger has just eaten the lamb, and that's why he's
smiling,'' Essick said.
The landmark exhibition was made possible by the recent restoration of
the library's collection of illuminated poems by Blake, which were
printed during the poet's lifetime (1757-1827) and bound during the
19th century.
With ``William Blake's Illuminated Prints,'' the library is presenting
numerous selections from each of his collections, including the popular
``Songs of Innocence and of Experience.''
Highlights include the only copy of the 1788 essay ``All Religions Are
One,'' Blake's first illuminated book and one of four known copies of
``Milton,'' his famous epic poem.
The exhibit even features an illustration from ``Songs of Innocence and
of Experience'' that has been interpreted as a self-portrait. It shows
Blake as a shepherd balancing an angel on his head -- a probable
reference to the divine voices and visions that he said inspired his
work. A more modern and skeptical interpretation has him suffering from
schizophrenia.
With only the most sizzling illustrations on display, a CD-ROM video
installation allows visitors to ``page'' by computer through the
library's complete Blake collection of 480 images. The computer display
also allows visitors to enlarge the manuscripts, some no larger than
postage stamps.
