Musharraf vows to punish mosque attack killers 
Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf vowed Tuesday to hunt down
and punish the gunmen who killed at least 10 people in a sectarian
attack on a Shiite Muslim mosque.
"Those responsible would be unearthed and given exemplary punishment,"
he said.
Such acts would only renew the resolve of the governmondolences to the
families of the 10 people gunned down during evening prayers Tuesday in
the Shah-Najaf mosque in Islamabad's twin city of Rawalpindi.
Tuesday's massacre was the first major sectarian attack since Musharraf
announced a nationwide crackdown on extremism last month.
He ordered an immediate investigation into the attack to be undertaken
jointly by the provincial Punjab and federal police agencies.
