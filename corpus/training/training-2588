Exiled Palestinian militants will be free to move in Europe: source 
Thirteen Palestinian militants heading into exile via Cyprus will be
allowed to move freely in any European Union countries that accept
them, European diplomatic sources said Friday.
The militants, who on Friday left Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity
after a month long stand-off with the Israeli military, have not been
charged with any crime by the EU and therefore will remain free.
"We don't know how to qualify these gentlemen. No one has exiled them,
nor deported them, and there is no judicial decision made concerning
them," a Spanish diplomat told AFP.
"They are leaving because it is a condition imposed on them by Israel
in order to resolve the problem of the Bethlehem Church of the
Nativity."
The judicial status of the men, who rank on Israel's most-wanted list,
as well as their final host countries, will be discussed at an EU
foreign ministers meeting on Monday in Brussels, the diplomat said.
