10 Foreign Mining Companies Explore Minerals in Ethiopia
Ethiopian Vice-Minister of Mines and Energy Shemsudin Ahmed announced
that 10 foreign mining companies have acquired licences for explorating
minerals in Ethiopia.
According to the Ethiopiian News Agency today, more than 50 foreign
companies have contacted the Ethiopian Ministry of Mines and Energy
since the enactment of the mining code to explore possible ways of
engaging in the sector.
The vice-minister said Ethiopia has vast mineral resources that are yet
to be exploited.
He added that geological studies conducted so far put Ethiopia ahead of
South Africa, one of the world's largest gold producing nations, in
gold deposits.
Meanwhile, about ten Ethiopian companies, four of them government
owned, are also engaged in the exploration and production of various
types of minerals. enditem =06231935 =06231937 NNNN 03:36 03:37 g # PAB
