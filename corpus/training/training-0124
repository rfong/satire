Fukushima takes lead in Japan LPGA championship 
Japan's Akiko Fukushima shot a three under par 69 for a three-stroke
lead on Saturday to move a step closer towards her first victory at the
Japan LPGA championship.
Starting the day one stroke behind overnight leader Michiko Hattori,
the 23-year-old from Kanagawa carded four birdies against one bogey for
a three-round total of six under par 210.
"I just tried to keep my concentration, because this is a course where
you can have a bogey or double bogey quite easily," said Fukushima, the
winner in Karuizawa last month.
Hattori, hoping for a birthday victory Sunday to end her two-year title
draught, bogeyed the final hole for a 73 to tie for second with fellow
Japanese Keiko Arai on 213s.
Arai scored four birdies against one bogey on the 6,427-yard Nagaoka
country club course.
Kaori Harada, 1993 champion, was tied for fourth on 215, while
defending champion Aki Takamura was tied for 20th on 221.
