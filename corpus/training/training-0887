Croatia, Yugoslavia to Open Borders 
Croatia and Yugoslavia will formally open seven border check points at
midnight Sunday to implement an agreement signed by the two countries.
Under the border agreement, which went into effect Saturday, the seven
border check points opened earlier Saturday include Ilok and Batina,
the official newspaper of Croatia Viesnik reported.
The opening of the borders marked further improvement of the relations
between the two countries. Their highways and railroads have already
been opened this year.
The citizens of the two countries can cross border freely to visit
their relatives and friends and to go to work or school after they get
visas and border passes.
As of December 12, Croatia has released 8,000 entry-exit visas and
border passes to those Serbs working and studying in Croatia, and the
Yugoslav Embassy in Croatia also has granted 5,000 visas to Croatian
citizens.
