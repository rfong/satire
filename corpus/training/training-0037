UNITA Expected Back in Luanda, Battle Fronts Tense 
UNITA rebel leaders are expected to return to Luanda next week for the
first time in two years to start putting a power-sharing agreement into
effect, a government official said Thursday.
Battle fronts remained quiet but tense after a truce that took effect
Tuesday. UNITA's Radio Vorgan accused government troops of several
military actions across the country but said rebel troops were still
respecting the cease-fire.
Vorgan claimed government planes dropped leaflets over Andulo, a key
rebel-controlled airstrip in central Angola, threatening an imminent
attack.
There were no claims of truce violations from the government side, nor
any verification of UNITA claims by a U.N. mission, which plans to
deploy 7,000 peacekeepers only once the truce is seen to be holding.
Since signing a treaty to end their 19-year civil war on Sunday in
Lusaka, Zambia, government and rebel negotiators have made swift
progress on completing the accord's small print.
Chief government negotiator Gen. Pedro Neto said Thursday he expects
UNITA representatives to meet in Luanda, the capital, next Tuesday with
the government and U.N., U.S., Russian and Portuguese officials who
brokered the accord.
Neto said the first item at the talks would be establishing centers
around the country for rebel soldiers to surrender their arms and be
demobilized or integrated into the national army or police.
U.N. mediators have proposed 12 sites but UNITA demands 16, claiming
difficulties in moving their troops in some areas.
Talks in Luanda whould be a step toward allowing UNITA's leadership,
including rebel chief Jonas Savimbi, back into the capital.
Savimbi returned to war after losing 1992 elections he claimed were
fraudulent.
Savimbi missed Sunday's signing, claiming he was trapped by a
government offensive, and he and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
appointed proxies to sign for them.
A direct meeting between the two leaders could now be discussed in the
Luanda talks.
Fighting died down a few hours after Tuesday's cease-fire but the road
to peace remains precarious.
The 65-page treaty took a year to negotiate and will take more than a
year to implement, with the deadline Jan. 29, 1996. Only then would
runoff elections take place between dos Santos and Savimbi to complete
1992's unfinished balloting.
Some 500,000 Angolans have died in the 19-year war that erupted on the
eve of independence from Portugal in 1975. Starvation and disease
threatens millions.
