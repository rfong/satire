"Dancing Partner" Looking For Sponsors 
China's first musical, "Dancing Partner", performed by the Beijing
Institute of Dancing, is advertising for sponsors.
Its advertisements, carried in a group of newspapers, have attracted
attention nationwide, said Zhu Xianfeng, deputy director of the
performance center of the institute.
Some 800,000 yuan (about 88,000 US dollars) is needed for the stage
design. This is about half of the total cost for rehearsals, Zhu said.
That is the country's first stage play which seeks sponsorship by means
of advertisements.
"Many enterprises have expressed interest in co-operating with us. In
return, we will use the names and products of the enterprises in
staging the musical in a way that will not affect its artistic
quality," Zhu said.
Most Chinese art troupes are facing a lack of money, and the best way
to solve this problem is to strengthen the co-operation between art
troupes and enterprises, he added.
It has been learned that the musical, a love story with dances and pop
music, is scheduled to be staged in May next year in Beijing.
