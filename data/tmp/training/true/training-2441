Bundesbank/NNP seen/VBN as/RB unlikely/JJ to/TO lower/VB key/JJ rates/NNS this/DT week/NN The/DT Bundesbank/NNP will/MD probably/RB leave/VB its/PRP$ key/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS unchanged/JJ at/IN this/DT week/NN 's/POS meeting/NN of/IN its/PRP$ central/JJ council/NN ,/, but/CC might/MD make/VB a/DT gesture/NN on/IN Wednesday/NNP on/IN its/PRP$ repurchase/VBN rate/NN because/RB of/IN the/DT unexpected/JJ drop/NN in/IN the/DT M3/NNP money/NN supply/NN announced/VBD Tuesday/NNP ,/, analysts/NNS say/VBP ./.

The/DT policy-making/JJ central/JJ council/NN is/VBZ to/TO meet/VB on/IN Thursday/NNP ,/, and/CC analyst/NN Jeorg/NNP Henzler/NNP at/IN Industrial/NNP Bank/NNP of/IN Japan/NNP commented/VBD that/IN ``/`` We/PRP had/VBD been/VBN thinking/VBG that/IN the/DT Bundesbank/NNP would/MD reduce/VB its/PRP$ key/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- the/DT discount/NN rate/NN and/CC the/DT Lombard/NNP rate/NN -RRB-/-RRB- at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN September/NNP or/CC in/IN early/JJ October/NNP ./.

But/CC the/DT July/NNP dip/NN in/IN M3/NNP opens/VBZ up/RP a/DT completely/RB new/JJ prospect/NN ''/'' ./.

M3/NNP ,/, the/DT Bundesbank/NNP 's/POS mid-term/JJ inflation/NN indicator/NN ,/, unexpectedly/RB fell/VBD in/IN July/NNP at/IN an/DT annualized/JJ 0.4/CD percent/NN rate/NN on/IN provisional/JJ figures/NNS ,/, after/IN a/DT 0.4/CD percent/NN rise/NN in/IN June/NNP on/IN final/JJ figures/NNS ./.

The/DT decline/NN surprised/VBD most/JJS analysts/NNS ,/, who/WP had/VBD expected/VBN an/DT annualized/JJ rise/NN of/IN 0.7/CD to/TO 1.2/CD percent/NN ./.

The/DT central/JJ bank/NN relies/VBZ mainly/RB on/IN M3/NNP and/CC the/DT consumer/NN price/NN index/NN in/IN deciding/VBG on/IN monetary/JJ policy/NN ./.

Henzler/NNP said/VBD conditions/NNS were/VBD now/RB ``/`` definitely/RB better/JJR ''/'' for/IN those/DT hoping/VBG for/IN a/DT cut/NN in/IN the/DT Bundesbank/NNP 's/POS key/JJ rates/NNS ,/, and/CC such/PDT a/DT move/NN at/IN the/DT central/JJ council/NN meeting/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP is/VBZ not/RB impossible/JJ ./.

The/DT discount/NN rate/NN has/VBZ been/VBN 4/CD percent/NN since/IN March/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT Lombard/NNP 6/CD percent/NN since/IN May/NNP 13/CD last/JJ year/NN ./.

Holger/NNP Fahringkrug/NNP ,/, an/DT analyst/NN at/IN Union/NNP Bank/NNP of/IN Switzerland/NNP ,/, said/VBD the/DT decline/NN of/IN M3/NNP on/IN an/DT annual/JJ basis/NN in/IN July/NNP clearly/RB shows/VBZ that/IN growth/NN is/VBZ slowing/VBG in/IN Germany/NNP ,/, as/IN was/VBD already/RB shown/VBN by/IN the/DT drop/NN in/IN incoming/JJ orders/NNS to/TO industry/NN -LRB-/-LRB- off/RB 3.5/CD percent/NN in/IN June/NNP from/IN May/NNP ,/, seasonally/RB adjusted/VBN -RRB-/-RRB- announced/VBN by/IN the/DT Economics/NNP Ministry/NNP on/IN Monday/NNP ./.

``/`` This/DT cocktail/NN of/IN data/NNS has/VBZ definitely/RB improved/VBN chances/NNS of/IN monetary/JJ loosening/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT rate/NN drop/NN could/MD even/RB occur/VB this/DT week/NN ''/'' ,/, said/VBD Fahringkrug/NNP ./.

The/DT absence/NN of/IN inflation/NN risks/NNS in/IN Germany/NNP is/VBZ another/DT argument/NN for/IN lowering/VBG rates/NNS ,/, he/PRP continued/VBD ./.

``/`` Wholesale/JJ prices/NNS fell/VBD by/IN 0.7/CD percent/NN in/IN July/NNP from/IN June/NNP ,/, and/CC industrial/JJ production/NN prices/NNS by/IN 0.1/CD percent/NN in/IN July/NNP from/IN June/NNP ,/, showing/VBG that/IN there/EX are/VBP good/JJ chances/NNS the/DT rise/NN in/IN consumer/NN prices/NNS in/IN western/JJ Germany/NNP will/MD approach/VB the/DT forecast/NN the/DT Bundesbank/NNP made/VBD for/IN 1995/CD ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ 2/CD percent/NN ''/'' ./.

Analyst/NNP Peter/NNP Pietsch/NNP at/IN Commerzbank/NNP thinks/VBZ the/DT Bundesbank/NNP will/MD not/RB reduce/VB its/PRP$ key/JJ rates/NNS on/IN Thursday/NNP ,/, but/CC the/DT securities/NNS repurchase/NN -LRB-/-LRB- ``/`` repo/NN ''/'' -RRB-/-RRB- rate/NN might/MD be/VB cut/VBN again/RB on/IN Wednesday/NNP this/DT week/NN ./.

All/DT analysts/NNS queried/VBN shared/VBD this/DT view/NN ,/, and/CC many/JJ of/IN them/PRP think/VBP the/DT marginal/JJ repo/NN rate/NN could/MD go/VB as/RB low/JJ as/IN 4.15/CD percent/NN in/IN the/DT coming/VBG weeks/NNS ./.

The/DT repo/NN rate/NN enables/VBZ the/DT central/JJ bank/NN to/TO fine-tune/JJ monetary/JJ policy/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT rate/NN at/IN which/WDT the/DT central/JJ bank/NN acquires/VBZ commercial/JJ paper/NN from/IN the/DT commercial/JJ banks/NNS for/IN periods/NNS ranging/VBG from/IN a/DT few/JJ days/NNS to/TO two/CD months/NNS ,/, in/IN exchange/NN for/IN allocating/VBG funds/NNS to/TO the/DT banks/NNS ./.

The/DT bank/NN will/MD also/RB naturally/RB keep/VB an/DT eye/NN on/IN exchange/NN rates/NNS ,/, especially/RB on/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN the/DT dollar/NN ,/, which/WDT firmed/VBD last/JJ week/NN against/IN the/DT mark/NN and/CC the/DT yen/NN in/IN the/DT wake/NN of/IN large-scale/JJ intervention/NN by/IN the/DT US/NNP Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP ,/, the/DT Bank/NNP of/IN Japan/NNP and/CC the/DT Bundesbank/NNP ./.

Analyst/NNP John/NNP Lipsky/NNP at/IN Salomon/NNP Brothers/NNPS commented/VBD that/IN confirmation/NN of/IN the/DT dollar/NN 's/POS new/JJ firmness/NN would/MD make/VB a/DT Bundesbank/NNP rate/NN cut/NN ``/`` less/RBR necessary/JJ ./.

Without/IN being/VBG so/RB categorical/JJ as/IN Lipsky/NNP ,/, Henzler/NNP also/RB said/VBD the/DT Bundesbank/NNP would/MD take/VB time/NN to/TO observe/VB the/DT dollar/NN 's/POS trend/NN before/IN lowering/VBG its/PRP$ key/JJ rates/NNS ./.
