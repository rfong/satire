Monsoon Causes Landslides in Nepal, Floods in Bangladesh
Monsoon rains caused landslides that killed at least 13 people in Nepal
and flooded highways in Bangladesh that stranded 10,000 commuters,
reports said Thursday.
Flood waters swept away another six people in the Gaibandha and
Sirajganj districts of Bangladesh on Thursday. That raised the
country's monsoon death toll to 104 since July 1, including 30 who died
of waterborne diseases such as dysentery or malaria.
In Nepal, at least 118 people have been killed since the onset of
monsoon on June 3. Nearly 70 of them were buried alive or swept away by
floods in Khotang district, 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of
Katmandu, the capital of Nepal.
This month, Katmandu valley, which is surrounded by steep mountains,
recorded 588 millimeters (23 inches) of rainfall _ the highest in the
past 23 years, officials said.
In Assam, a state in northeastern India, downpours and floods have
killed at least 16 people.
In Bangladesh, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia visited flood-hit areas in a
speedboat on Wednesday, and many villagers listened to her discuss
their problem while standing waist-deep in water.
``Have courage and face the difficulties with fortitude. The government
is with you,'' Mrs. Zia said.
Ferries that normally carry passengers and vehicles stopped working in
Dhaka, the capital, after the flooded Jamuna River washed away the
boarding ramps, a government official said.
Since early this month, floods have marooned at least 3 million people
in north Bangladesh. Many have remained on their rooftops or fled to
nearby school buildings or river embankments.
Many roads between Dhaka and the north have been flooded.
Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 120 million people, is buffeted
by floods and cyclones that kill hundreds of people every year. Last
month, flash floods killed at least 90 people and left thousands of
people homeless in the north. (bg/fh/aks/twx)
