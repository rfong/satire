Muhamed Sacirbey nominated as successor to slain foreign minister 
Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia-Hercegovina's envoy to the United Nations, has
been named as successor to Irfan Ljubijankic who died last week when
his helicopter was downed by Serb rebels, officials announced.
The ruling Democratic Party proposed Sacirbey for the post, they said.
Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic told AFP that the foreign policy
council which he heads would meet later Wednesday to decide on
Sacirbey's appointment.
A final decision by the collegiate Bosnian presidency is expected
Thursday.
Ljubijankic died overnight Saturday when Croatian Serb rebels shot down
his helicopter after it took off from the Moslem enclave of Bihac in
northwest Bosnia.
