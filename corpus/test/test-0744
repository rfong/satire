The Season Of Winter Sad
When Dr. Norman Rosenthal arrived in New York from his native South
Africa nearly 20 years ago, he was invigorated by the long summer days,
which stretched beyond anything he had experienced 23 degrees south of
the equator. Full of enthusiasm, he plunged into his psychiatric
residency and research on mood disorders.
``I was high and full of vitality,'' he said.
Then came fall and the end of daylight saving time. The light grew
slanting and weak, and darkness descended before he left work.
Rosenthal, his exuberance swirling away like so many dead leaves, began
slogging through his tasks and wondering how he had ever gotten so
overextended. So this was winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Today, many northern dwellers would recognize Rosenthal's wintry gloom
as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, a term Rosenthal coined after
he moved to the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md.,
where he is director of light-therapy studies.
But in the early 1980s, when Rosenthal and other researchers began
experimenting with treatment of winter depression, no one was sure
those patients even had a bona fide disorder.
``I think I would not have taken them so seriously had it not been for
my own situation,'' Rosenthal said. ``At that time the area was
considered a fringe area. It was regarded as an exotic curiosity.''
This is a SAD story with a happy ending. Research is advancing so
rapidly that Rosenthal has substantially reworked his 1989 book,
``Seasons of the Mind,'' even giving it a new title, ``Winter Blues:
Seasonal Affective Disorder, What It Is and How to Overcome It'' (The
Guilford Press, $14.95).
``This is the wonderful good news about this problem: It is so
eminently treatable,'' Rosenthal said. ``I have not seen a single case
where I could not do a thing to help. Please don't give up. Layer one
treatment on top of another.''
Seattle was one of five cities on his book tour -- all chosen because
their gray skies and northern latitude make them prime settings for the
disorder, which affects 5 to 6 percent of the U.S. population. Another
14 to 15 percent suffer milder cases of ``winter blues.''
For SAD sufferers, the symptoms appear with monotonous predictability:
loss of energy, concentration and sex drive, plus withdrawal from
social situations. The exact timing of the symptoms varies, with
January and February being especially debilitating for many people, but
in all cases the pattern follows the course of the sun. Some SAD
sufferers, so blue in winter, feel unusually energetic and creative in
spring and summer.
Besides its cyclical nature, SAD differs from nonseasonal depression in
several ways, Rosenthal said.
``Instead of patients losing weight and sleeping less, as they do with
classical depression,'' he said, ``they overeat and oversleep and gain
weight.''
In a rarer twist, some people in hot climes suffer from summer SAD.
Unlike their winter counterparts, they tend to eat less and lose
weight, and instead of slowing they become more agitated and express
more suicidal thoughts.
Although SAD occurs among all ages and ethnic groups, it is four times
more common among women than men, with the 20s to 40s considered the
prime age group for the disorder. Rosenthal said SAD is far more common
among children and adolescents than researchers first believed.
``Especially after puberty, in the last years of high school, the
prevalence in children really picks up,'' he said, adding that one
million children and teens have SAD. In most cases their symptoms are
not diagnosed or are attributed to something else, such as attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although SAD can coexist with
ADHD and other problems, he said, the key is that it peaks in winter
and ebbs in spring or summer.
Researchers also have learned that SAD runs in families.
``Let's find the genes,'' Rosenthal said. ``That's going to be the next
triumphant breakthrough. Some of the genes will have been found by the
end of the decade.''
Not surprisingly, light therapy is one of the most promising
treatments. In severe cases, light may be supplemented by
antidepressant medication, psychotherapy, winter vacations or even
relocating to a sunnier locale.
Several companies manufacture devices that artificially deliver the
benefits of sunlight, which works its magic on the eye and brain, not
the skin, making tanning beds useless for treating the disorder.
Light boxes have grown more refined and easier to use in the past few
years, and Rosenthal said insurance companies are increasingly likely
to cover the cost, which averages $350 to $500. He devotes an entire
chapter to lights -- from dawn simulators to light visors to slanting
desktop boxes that emit 10,000 lux -- equal to the amount of light half
an hour after sunrise on a clear day. (A sunny day at the beach
delivers about 100,000 lux).
``My office has got a light box, my home has got a light box, I have an
exercise room with light,'' he said.
Although early studies used ``full-spectrum'' lights, which imitate the
balance of natural sunlight, researchers have found that such lights
are no better than ordinary white fluorescent light and are potentially
harmful to the skin and eyes. When choosing a device, he said, look for
one that screens ultraviolet light.
Researchers disagree on the best time of day to use the lights. Some
favor a dawn's-early-light approach, while Rosenthal advocates adopting
whatever schedule you can stick with. As with medication, the amount of
light needed is highly individual. Rosenthal suggests renting a light
box for a couple of weeks to see what works best.
``Try the slanted one first,'' he said. ``Go for the gold. It's the
strongest.''
The exact cause of SAD is still a hot topic among researchers. The
initial theory was that SAD involves irregular production of melatonin,
a hormone produced each night by the pea-sized pineal gland, situated
underneath the brain. The secretion of melatonin signals the duration
of darkness, Rosenthal said, and is an important seasonal cue in
animals that regulates everything from when deer grow antlers to when
snowshoe rabbits turn white.
When early studies failed to support the melatonin theory, most
researchers moved on. But Rosenthal said a later study showed that the
blood-pressure medication propranolol, when administered early in the
morning, cuts short the nightly production of melatonin and seems to
have some benefit in treating SAD.
``So our original melatonin theory has been revived,'' he said.
Other researchers are exploring the possibility that SAD sufferers
respond abnormally to stress. Rosenthal's own research focuses on the
role of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain.
``There is evidence that serotonin in the hypothalamus falls to its
lowest levels in the winter months,'' he said. ``There's also evidence
that light may enhance the transmission of serotonin. Another thing
that's thought to enhance it is dietary carbohydrates.''
