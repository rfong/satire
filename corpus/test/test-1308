Canada Reaffirms Support for China's Accession to WTO
Canada today reaffirmed its support for China's early accession to the
World Trade Organization.
"Canada and our WTO partners wish to see China as a full participant in
this new and vital world economic institution," Minister for
International trade Roy Maclaren told a meeting of the Canada-China
Business Council here.
Maclaren said the accession of China to the WTO is one of the key
issues that will govern Canada-China trade and investment ties in the
time ahead. "I hardly need remind you of the weight of China's presence
today in the world economy or its importance to Canada," he said.
The minister said his country hopes to play a "constructive role in
achieving China's reintegration within the evolving multilateral
trading system."
He said it is of concern that China, a country of such magnitude, not
be a full partner in the organization.
China's absence from this key international institution leaves a large
gap in the architecture of the multilateral trading system, which could
limit its potential, the minister said.
Maclaren said it is certainly in the interests of Canada and other
members of the WTO, as well as China, that this deficience be
rectified.
China is an increasingly important supplier to world markets and also
an increasingly important customer to Canada, the minister said.
Ultimately the objective for Canada and other WTO members in pursuing
China's accession is to win more open access to the Chinese market and
to secure a more predictable business environment for traders and
investors, he added.
"Canada and fellow WTO members are prepared to work hard to see that
the accession negotiations eventually succeed on terms satisfactory to
all," he said.
