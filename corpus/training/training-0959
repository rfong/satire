China Law Society Marks 50th Anniversary 
The China Law Society celebrated its 50th founding anniversary in
Beijing today at the Great Hall of the People.
Chinese Party and government leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji,
and Li Ruihuan sent letters of congratulations to the society.
Addressing the gathering, Wei Jianxing, one of the seven top policy
makers in China, said that over the past 50 years the China Law Society
has made a series of achievements in building a socialist democratic
legal system, and has provided powerful theoretical support for the
formation of a set of principles for ruling the country by law.
There is no set example that China must follow, but rather, the country
will find its own road in accordance with its national condition and
socialist system. It should not blindly copy the model of Western
countries, Wei said.
"We should highly value the establishment and development of a legal
system with Chinese characteristics. The experience of China shows that
only under the guidance of a legal theory with Chinese characteristics
can the country march forward along a correct path, " he said.
He urged the Party to lend great importance to the study of social
sciences, the same as it does for the natural sciences.
Party committees and governments at all levels also should enhance
guidance and create a better environment for legal research, he
concluded.
