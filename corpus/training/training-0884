Cadbury To Open Chocolate Factory In Russia 
Cadbury Schweppes PLC said Monday it will open a chocolate
confectionary factory in Russia as it seeks to expand in Europe's No. 3
market for the sweets.
Cadbury and a joint venture partner, the Russian distributor Rostel,
will invest 75 million pounds (dlrs 117 million) over the next two
years to build the plant in Chudovo, near St. Petersburg, and to
provide working capital.
Cadbury already sells a little more than 5 percent of the chocolate
consumed by Russians but said that in order to grow it would need to
stop depending on imports from its factories elsewhere.
Russians eat 500,000 tons of the candy a year, putting them just
slightly behind Britons and Germans as Europe's biggest chocolate
consumers.
The joint venture will be held 70 percent by Cadbury and 30 percent by
Moscow-based Rostel, which imports a variety of western goods into
Russia.
Cadbury declined to make any sales projections for Russia, where its
market share is now roughly equal to that of rivals Mars ILDB1102 -----
