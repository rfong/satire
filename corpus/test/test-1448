Paralyzed Chinese Gymnast Shows Great Courage
She is smiling and consoling her weeping mother, even though she cannot
feel anything from mid-chest down.
The braveness and courage shown by the 17-year-old Chinese female
gymnast Sang Lan moved everyone who went to see her after Tuesday's
tragic accident.
Sang Lan broke her neck in the warm-up for the women's vault
competition that night, and know she would probably be confined to a
wheelchair for the rest of her life.
"She is a very special young lady who has shown an incredible amount of
strength and courage," Thomas Gulotta, Nassau County Executive, highly
praised her Sunday.
"She only asked for one thing after the injury. She said, 'Would it be
possible for me to watch the Goodwill Games tonight from TV?'", Gulotta
added.
Her wish was fulfilled. And she broke into a big smile seeing teammates
Huang Xu and Ling Jie won the mixed pair gold in the gymnastics
competition.
"We will send this gold medal to Sang Lan, because we have drawn great
courage from her," Huang said after the triumph.
Tonight, Huang and all the Chinese gymnastics team members went to
Nassau County Medical Center to say good-bye before flying home, and
all the gymnasts could not hold their tears back except Sang.
Sang, who was watching "The Lion King" on TV after completing an
operation last night, told her teammates to stop crying.
"I am fine now, don't be sad. I really hope I could go home with you.
Please kiss me good-bye. I will miss you all and see you soon," the
delicate Chinese girl said.
Sang Lan's parents were driven directly to the hospital from airport to
visit their daughter. But the Sangs could not help dropping to their
knees when they saw Dr. Vincent Leone, director of spine surgery at the
center.
With tears trickling down their faces, the parents begged the doctor to
save their only daughter.
Leone also fell on his knees, saying they had tried their best possible
to improve Sang Lan's condition.
"We trust you American doctors, please create some miracle to help Sang
Lan stand up again," Sang's mother said.
Tonight, Sang's parents went to see her again with the Chinese team.
Huang Yubin, coach of the team, read Sang Lan several letters from her
friends back in China.
The tough man choked his voice several times and the reading had to be
relayed through many people.
Sang never complained about discomfort or pain. Gulotta told the press
today that when he asked her whether she remembered him, Sang Lan joked
with him by saying "To me, all Americans look alike."
Dr. Vincent Leone, director of spine surgery at the medical center,
said: "We found severe damage to the C6 and C7 levels. We also found
the C5-6 interval was disrupted. That means it is a complex spinal cord
injury."
He said there was a serious amount of bone fragments. Sang Lan
underwent a difficult surgery but she pulled through it very well.
But the doctor said: "Her chances of walking again do not just solely
depend on surgery. They depend on a multifaceted approach to her care."
Dr. Anthony Angelo, medical director of the medical center, said: "Dr.
Leone and his staff did an absolutely superb job. We couldn't be more
thrilled with the outcome of this surgery. The surgery stabilized Sang
Lan's neck. It was exceptionally delicate and went exceptionally well.
"Sang Lan is sitting up in a chair, she is in wonderful spirits this
morning. She feels relieved. She ate, drank and she has a world of
strength emotionally and physically."
Angelo told the press that no surgery can undo the damage that may have
already been done to her spinal cord and they simply don't know how
severe that is yet. "Only time will tell us that."
Sang Lan has received countless cards and letters from all over the
world. One letter reads: "Dear Sang, I am very sorry about the
accident. You are a beautiful girl and life doesn't seem fair, but God
will give you strength to make the best of the situation. I hope you
recover soon and I will pray for you."
This is one sentiment of many sentiments that have been flowing into
the medical center. Sang Lan knows that, and she needs that.
But what she needs not is the tears and complaints. She told her
mother: "Mom, don't cry and don't be sad. I will be stand up again. I
know that."
