Kenya Sweeps Top Three in Men's 3,000m Steeplechase 
Kenya made a clean sweep in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase final at
the 6th World Athletics Championships here today.
Wilson Kipketer finished first in 8:05.84, ahead of Moses Kiptanui,
8:06.04, and Bernard Barmasai, also 8:06.04.
World record holder and defending champion Kiptanui led the pace and
passed the first 1,000 meters in 2:45.86, followed by Barmasai and Saad
Al Asmari of Saudi Arabia. Kipketer lured at rear comfortablely.
With one lap to go, the three Kenyans broke away from the other chasers
and fought toughly for the gold. Kiptanui couldn't maintain his fast
tempo but Kipketer just changed to a higher gear on the home straight
for his first major win.
