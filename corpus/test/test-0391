Cantona Persuaded Back to Manchester United 
A week after his threat to quit the England club, French striker Eric
Cantona returned Monday to England and Manchester United, according to
reports from Manchster, Britain,.
Cantona, banned from playing until the start of October, had asked for
a transfer last week after the Football Association launched an
investigation into his appearance in a closed-door training match
against Rochdale.
But United manager Alex Ferguson flew to Paris and successfully
persuaded him to return to the club.
Cantona made no comment as he entered the building which houses the
club.
Cantona served 120 hours of community service as punishment for his
kung-fu kick on a Crystal Palace supporter last season, the reports
said.
