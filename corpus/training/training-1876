Two Russians, One Lithuanian Fail Doping Tests 
Two Russian athletes, both of them bronze medalists, and one Lithuanian
woman cyclist were tested positive for stimulants, the spokeswoman of
the International Olympic Committee said here today.
The three convicted were Andrei Korneyev of Russia, bronze medalist in
the men's 200-meter breaststroke, Zafar Gouleiez of Russia, also
third-place finisher in 48-kg Greco Roman wrestling, and Rita Razmaita
of Lithuania in cycling who finished 13th in the women's sprint.
The Russians "were tested positive for Bromantan, a stimulant in class
A and therefore their medals were disqualified," said Michele Verdier,
IOC director of media and special projects.
The Lithuanian woman cyclist also failed the doping test for Bromantan,
she added.
This were the first three doping cases announced by the IOC medical
commission so far as the Olympic Games was going into the ninth-day
competition here on Sunday.
