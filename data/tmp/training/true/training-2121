In/IN the/DT Report/NNP on/IN the/DT Work/NN of/IN the/DT Government/NN delivered/VBN to/TO the/DT Third/JJ Session/NN of/IN the/DT Eighth/NNP National/NNP People/NNPS 's/POS Congress/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- NPC/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, Li/NNP admitted/VBD that/IN ``/`` an/DT evident/JJ problem/NN last/JJ year/NN is/VBZ the/DT excessive/JJ rise/NN in/IN prices/NNS ./. ''/''

In/IN the/DT work/NN report/NN last/JJ year/NN ,/, Li/NNP said/VBD that/IN the/DT retail/JJ prices/NNS should/MD be/VB kept/VBN from/IN rising/VBG by/IN more/JJR than/IN 10/CD percent/NN ./.

``/`` Although/IN we/PRP made/VBD great/JJ efforts/NNS in/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, retail/JJ prices/NNS rose/VBD by/IN 21.7/CD percent/NN ,/, of/IN which/WDT about/RB 13/CD percentage/NN points/NNS resulted/VBD from/IN the/DT rise/NN in/IN prices/NNS of/IN foods/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` All/PDT this/DT aroused/VBD great/JJ resentment/NN in/IN the/DT masses/NNS ./. ''/''

To/TO put/VB the/DT price/NN rise/NN under/IN control/NN ,/, Li/NNP said/VBD that/IN the/DT Chinese/JJ government/NN will/MD take/VB measures/NNS in/IN the/DT follow/JJ four/CD aspects/NNS :/: Firstly/RB ,/, vigorous/JJ efforts/NNS will/MD be/VB made/VBN to/TO develop/VB agricultural/JJ production/NN and/CC increase/NN supplies/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT government/NN will/MD continue/VB controlling/VBG the/DT quantity/NN of/IN currency/NN issued/VBN and/CC the/DT scale/NN of/IN credit/NN by/IN applying/VBG a/DT moderately/RB tight/JJ financial/JJ policy/NN and/CC keeping/VBG expenditures/NNS within/IN the/DT limit/NN of/IN income/NN ./.

He/PRP said/VBD that/IN the/DT deficit/NN in/IN the/DT central/JJ budget/NN should/MD not/RB exceed/VB that/DT of/IN the/DT previous/JJ year/NN ;/: and/CC the/DT local/JJ finance/NN should/MD maintain/VB a/DT balance/NN between/IN revenue/NN and/CC expenditure/NN ;/: and/CC the/DT management/NN of/IN extrabudgetary/JJ funds/NNS should/MD be/VB stepped/VBN up/RP ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, Li/NNP said/VBD ,/, the/DT scale/NN of/IN investment/NN in/IN fixed/VBN assets/NNS should/MD be/VB brought/VBN under/IN control/NN and/CC so/RB should/MD the/DT excessive/JJ growth/NN of/IN consumption/NN funds/NNS ./.

Since/IN China/NNP is/VBZ a/DT developing/VBG country/NN ,/, Li/NNP said/VBD ,/, only/RB moderate/JJ consumption/NN is/VBZ applicable/JJ and/CC a/DT high/JJ level/NN of/IN consumption/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB advocated/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO adhere/VB over/IN a/DT long/JJ period/NN of/IN time/NN to/TO the/DT principle/NN of/IN plain/RB living/JJ and/CC hard/JJ struggle/NN and/CC of/IN building/VBG up/RP the/DT country/NN with/IN industry/NN and/CC thrift/NN ,/, Li/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Extravagance/NNP and/CC waste/NN should/MD be/VB rejected/VBN ./. ''/''

Li/NNP pointed/VBD out/RP that/IN effective/JJ measures/NNS should/MD be/VB adopted/VBN this/DT year/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT living/VBG standard/NN of/IN people/NNS in/IN both/DT urban/JJ and/CC rural/JJ areas/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT growth/NN of/IN funds/NNS for/IN consumption/NN should/MD be/VB slower/JJR than/IN the/DT growth/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT rise/NN in/IN incomes/NNS of/IN staff/NN and/CC workers/NNS should/MD be/VB lower/JJR than/IN that/DT of/IN labor/NN productivity/NN ./.

``/`` We/PRP should/MD be/VB concerned/VBN with/IN the/DT living/VBG conditions/NNS of/IN people/NNS in/IN poverty-stricken/JJ areas/NNS ,/, the/DT low-income/JJ earners/NNS and/CC retirees/NNS ,/, and/CC earnestly/RB help/VB solve/VB their/PRP$ difficulties/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

Li/NNP articulated/VBD that/IN China/NNP will/MD strengthen/VB the/DT control/NN and/CC supervision/NN over/IN prices/NNS ,/, especially/RB those/DT for/IN daily/JJ necessities/NNS ,/, improve/VB the/DT order/NN of/IN circulation/NN ,/, oppose/VB unfair/JJ competition/NN ,/, and/CC take/VB strong/JJ measures/NNS to/TO crack/VB down/RP on/IN the/DT production/NN and/CC sale/NN of/IN fake/JJ or/CC poor/JJ quality/NN commodities/NNS and/CC the/DT making/NN of/IN exorbitant/JJ profits/NNS ./.

The/DT readjustments/NNS in/IN pricing/NN have/VBP been/VBN carried/VBN out/RP fairly/RB quickly/RB in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ./.

The/DT task/NN this/DT year/NN is/VBZ to/TO offset/VB the/DT effect/NN of/IN price/NN rises/NNS in/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS and/CC generally/RB speaking/NN ,/, no/DT new/JJ price-regulating/JJ measures/NNS will/MD be/VB taken/VBN ./.

The/DT pricing/NN reform/NN should/MD focus/VB on/IN establishing/VBG and/CC improving/VBG the/DT system/NN of/IN market/NN management/NN and/CC price/NN control/NN ./.

Li/NNP admitted/VBD that/IN such/PDT a/DT sharp/JJ rise/NN in/IN prices/NNS last/JJ year/NN was/VBD due/JJ both/DT to/TO objective/JJ reasons/NNS and/CC to/TO mistakes/NNS of/IN governments/NNS at/IN all/DT levels/NNS ./.

First/RB ,/, last/JJ year/NN China/NNP readjusted/VBD the/DT prices/NNS for/IN many/JJ commodities/NNS and/CC adopted/VBD many/JJ reform/NN measures/NNS that/WDT affected/VBD prices/NNS ./.

But/CC the/DT government/NN had/VBD underestimated/VBN the/DT repercussions/NNS of/IN these/DT measures/NNS ./.

Second/LS ,/, China/NNP invested/VBD insufficiently/RB in/IN agriculture/NN ./.

Some/DT areas/NNS slackened/VBD their/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO produce/VB grain/NN and/CC implement/VB the/DT ``/`` market/NN basket/NN ''/'' project/NN ,/, which/WDT resulted/VBD in/IN a/DT sharp/JJ rise/NN in/IN the/DT prices/NNS of/IN agricultural/JJ products/NNS ./.

Third/LS ,/, there/EX had/VBD been/VBN a/DT rapid/JJ growth/NN of/IN investment/NN in/IN fixed/VBN assets/NNS and/CC consumption/NN funds/NNS ,/, and/CC too/RB much/JJ currency/NN had/VBD been/VBN put/VBN into/IN circulation/NN for/IN several/JJ years/NNS running/VBG ./.

The/DT government/NN did/VBD not/RB take/VB emergency/NN measures/NNS to/TO stop/VB these/DT practices/NNS or/CC launch/VB an/DT overall/JJ austerity/NN program/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO prevent/VB a/DT sharp/JJ decrease/NN in/IN economic/JJ growth/NN ,/, but/CC thereby/RB increased/VBD the/DT difficulty/NN in/IN curbing/VBG price/NN rises/NNS ./.

Fourth/JJ ,/, management/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN and/CC prices/NNS was/VBD slackened/VBN to/TO some/DT extent/NN ./.

The/DT legal/JJ system/NN was/VBD not/RB yet/RB sound/JJ ;/: the/DT market/NN still/RB needed/VBD to/TO be/VB standardized/JJ ;/: there/EX were/VBD too/RB many/JJ price/NN rises/NNS and/CC charges/NNS were/VBD common/JJ ./.

Li/NNP said/VBD that/IN under/IN the/DT circumstances/NNS of/IN socialist/JJ market/NN economy/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ for/IN the/DT government/NN to/TO control/VB and/CC administrate/VB the/DT prizes/NNS of/IN some/DT commodities/NNS essential/JJ to/TO the/DT national/JJ economy/NN and/CC people/NNS 's/POS livelihood/NN ./.
