Village election turns into anti-graft protest in southern China 
Angry villagers blocked roads during an election which turned into a
large-scale anti-corruption protest in southern China's Guangdong
province, it was reported Monday.
Some 4,000 people staged a sit-in at main roads leading to their
village in Qiaoxiang county, Dong'guan, some 150 kilometres (93 miles)
north-west of Hong Kong, on Sunday, to protest against local officials
who they said had profited from dubious land leases, the
Chinese-language Ming Pao daily said.
The protests started when residents refused to cast their votes in
village elections, demanding officials disclose the results of past
land lease deals.
The paper said a former party secretary of the village failed to give
details of land deals during his term from which he was alleged to have
gained some 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars). The villagers
were reported to have seen none of the profits.
The residents were demanding the return of the land to the village and
the equal distribution of profits from land leases. They also wanted to
see accounts of past land deals and to prosecute any fraudulent
officials.
The mass protest led to the election being called off, but police took
no action against the villagers.
Chinese villages often lease land to foreign investors, including those
from Hong Kong.
China has allowed direct elections at the village level since 1988, but
the elections have been largely organised and arranged by local
Communist Party committees.
