As price-cutting continues, buying instead of renting becomes an
ever-more-popular pastime.
At a Suncoast Motion Picture store in Connecticut, the scene resembles
that at video outlets everywhere. From floor to ceiling are hundreds of
videos for sale at prices as low as $5.99. Suncoast, a national chain,
only sells videos and doesn't rent them, but the situation points up a
strong overall trend: customers are buying tapes of all kinds in large
quantities and at prices that keep dropping.
Last year, consumers spent almost as much to buy videos as they did to
rent them. This fall, the biggest sales titles have been ``Jurassic
Park'' and ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'' Distributors say,
however, that sales of both have slumped a bit and they may have peaked
before Christmas. Already talk has turned to the next two titles
expected to sell in great numbers: ``The Lion King,'' due in March, and
``Forrest Gump,'' to be released in April.
In the front of the Suncoast store are stacks of ``Speed,'' currently
No.1 on some best-seller lists, and ``Tombstone,'' formerly a best
renter and now, with its price cut to $19.99, a best seller.
Also evident are Christmas packages, generally in the $70 to $80
category: special editions of ``Schindler's List'' ($139.98), ``Dances
With Wolves,'' ``Citizen Kane,'' ``My Fair Lady,'' ``Fantasia,''
``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' ``Gone With the Wind,'' ``Beauty and the
Beast'' and ``Baseball: A Film by Ken Burns'' ($179.98).
But the primary products appear to be hundreds of movies of all eras
and genres priced at $12.99 and less. Sales of ``Jurassic Park'' can
obscure the fact that consumers are buying all kinds films, especially
if the price is right.
One distributor that can offer proof of this is United American Video
of Charlotte, N.C. The company works the seams of the movie market,
looking for the kinds of older titles people want to collect,
duplicating the tapes in its own plant and distributing them to outlets
like Suncoast, where they sell at prices from $3.99 to $12.99.
Much of what United American Video distributes is pure B movie, but
there is a higher level. ``We're not talking about B movies so much as
older re-issued movies,'' said Jerry Pettus Jr., the president of the
firm.
By that he means major feature films that were originally released on
tape by studio video divisions. After, say, five or seven years on the
market, the studio might become disinterested and let video rights
revert to the producers.
``The producers then go looking for somebody to remarket the movies at
a lower price point,'' Pettus said.
Recent examples, all licensed to United American Video, include ``All
of Me,'' the 1984 Carl Reiner film starring Steve Martin and Lily
Tomlin; ``The Bounty,'' the 1984 film with Mel Gibson and Anthony
Hopkins, and ``Best Seller,'' a 1987 movie with James Woods.
In cases like these, United American Video repackages the films in the
extended-play mode, a duplicating method that packs more movie onto
less tape. Extended play lowers picture quality, but it also lowers the
price to about $10 or, if the title is older and in the public domain,
Pettus said, all the way down to $3.99.
