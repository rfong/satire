For some time, D'Amato himself toyed with running for governor, and
many politicians said he coveted the job because it, more than any
other, is the center of political and patronage power in the state
(with about 3,800 appointments under the governor's control), and
D'Amato cut his teeth in the Nassau County Republican machine where
patronage was a way of life. Then, as he began sounding out relatively
obscure figures like Pataki, speculation grew that he did not really
want the party to win the governorship after all, since that could mean
a threat to him.
But once he threw himself behind Pataki's candidacy, he did so
wholeheartedly, lending aides and trying to transfer $400,000 in his
own campaign funds, until a court ruled that far exceeded legal
contribution limits.
D'Amato has warned allies of Marino, the State Senate Republican
leader, that his days are numbered because he tried to block Pataki's
candidacy in favor of London, who is running for comptroller instead in
a deal brokered by D'Amato and Michael Long, the chairman of the state
Conservative Party.
``The rumor was he just wanted to keep it open for himself,'' said
Long, a longtime D'Amato ally who has occasionally feuded with him,
too. ``Well, that's been proven wrong. He deserves to have a lot of
kudos if we're successful, and I think he deserves to have a very
strong power base.''
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller played a similar role of patron to Mayor John
Lindsay, but fell to bitter feuding when he thought Lindsay was not
adequately grateful. The two appointed dueling commissions to poke into
each other's government performance, and at one point, Rockefeller
threatened to send the National Guard to pick up the trash in the city
during a garbage strike.
``I lived through that one and I hope I'll never see anything like it
again,'' said Goodman.
Pataki has some history of discounting the wishes of politicians who
made him their protege. He was elected to the State Senate by
challenging Mary Goodhue, his old boss and the lone Republican woman in
the chamber. He was supported in that race by Change New York, an
anti-tax group that also opposed Marino, and in the Senate, Pataki
voted against Marino on the state budget, a major break in the lockstep
legislative rules of Albany, where such questions are worked out by the
leadership of both houses and then routinely ratified.
The relationship with Giuliani is also complex. Mayors and governors
face inherent tensions. The city badly needs state aid that could be
curtailed if Pataki cuts spending. Giuliani did not support Pataki's
candidacy and has yet to endorse him, and the two men have different
geo-political bases and perhaps conflicting ambitions.
``If George Pataki wins, but only barely falls across the finish line
because his own party wasn't united, I could imagine there'd be some
anger,'' said City Councilman Charles B. Millard, the Republican
nominee for Congress on the Upper East Side.
``I think that Mayor Giuliani is right to say `I want to know for sure
what's going to happen to New York City before I take a position.' I
worry, though, if Pataki doesn't provide good enough answers for him
and the Mayor stays out of the race. Because both have interests in
working together that a lot of other people in the party don't
necessarily share. Upstate Republicans are not fans of New York City.''
