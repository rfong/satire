Kumaratunga Offers Olive Branch to Tamil Rebels
But if rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are not
willing to talk the government will not give in to their terror
tactics, said Kumaratunga in her address to the nation to mark the War
Heroes Day which fell on Wednesday.
"We have invited the LTTE for discussions several times, but they have
proved that they are not interested in peace," said the president.
She said, "They are not even interested in peace for the Tamils. It is
clear that the LTTE and the Tamils are two different entities."
Sri Lanka has been long plagued by ethnic conflicts between the
majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils. The conflicts have
escalated into a civil war since 1983 between government troops
dominated by Sinhalese and LTTE rebels who are fighting for a separate
Tamil state in the country's north and east.
President Kumaratunga made her address to the nation at a ceremony held
at the Presidential Secretariat to pay tribute to the war heroes.
She asked the nation to unite in the need of the hour and explained to
the nations of her government's plans to protect the families of the
fallen war heroes and the soldiers at the battlefront.
Sri Lanka observed two minute silence at 9:30 a.m. in memory of the
countries' fallen heroes. The country has organized several events to
pay tribute to their soldiers.
