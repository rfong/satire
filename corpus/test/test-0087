Ethiopia Launches National Strategic Framework on HIV
Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada Friday announced the launching of
the national strategic vision which is instrumental in curbing the
spread of HIV/AIDS in the country.
At the launching conference here, he said that the strategic framework
document, which contains the guideline and principles of the government
and the National AIDS Council (NAC), outlines the priority areas for
intervention and the institutional arrangement to conduct the program.
The framework also emphasizes the importance of saving the new
generation, providing due care for people living with HIV or AIDS and
preventing mother to child transmission which he said was crucial to
prevent the young generation, according to the president.
Negasso, who is also chairman of the NAC, said the strategic framework
designed for the coming five years was holistic in approach and
effective in interventions in dealing with the AIDS pandemic.
"We are fully convinced that the threat posed by HIV/AIDS pandemic and
other related diseases should constitute our central and top priority
for the first quarter of the 21st century", Negasso said.
He called on the donor community, the United Nations agencies and other
international organizations to consistently support the country's
effort in fighting the disease.
Representatives of various religious institutions presented their
reports at the conference in which they expressed their commitment to
strenuously work in the effort geared to fend off the spread of
HIV/AIDS in the country.
