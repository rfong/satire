NRP Resigns From Barak's Government EDS: Updates with details 
The National Religious Party (NRP), a partner of Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's government, decided on Thursday to quit the ruling coalition
ahead of the summit of Palestinians, Israel, and the United States
slated for July 11 near Washington.
The party's cabinet ministers and key members met at the office of
Housing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Levy and finally decided to
leave the government, the party said in an announcement.
The party discussed the three-way summit and the wide territorial
concessions Israel might make and then decided to leave the coalition,
the announcement added.
The prime minister will make decisions at the summit which will force
the NRP to resign from the government, the announcement quoted Levy as
saying, adding,"Barak's goal in the summit is to make decisions we can
not accept."
Cabinet ministers of the NRP, which has five members of the Knesset
(parliament), has also decided to submit their resignation letter to
Barak before he leaves for the United States.
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced at the White House on Wednesday
that the three-way summit between himself, Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will begin next Tuesday at Camp David near Washington.
The summit will try to resolve the key issues in the
Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks and reach a framework agreement
ahead of a September target for a final peace deal.
The NRP, a right-wing party, strongly opposes Barak to transfer more
territories to the Palestinians.
Ysrael Ba'aliya, Barak's another partner with four Knesset members, has
also decided to resign from the coalition ahead of the summit.
The resignation of the two parties have political repercussions to
Barak and the coalition will lose its majority in the Knesset.
