Opposition Newspaper Claims Arafat Shut it Down 
Yasser Arafat's government has blocked publication of an opposition
Palestinian weekly, the newspaper said Sunday.
The newspaper Al-'Ummeh, or The Nation, which supports the anti-Arafat
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said officials sent by
the Palestinian self-rule authority confiscated ``all the newspaper
materials'' at its printing presses in the West Bank town of Al Ram
last Thursday.
They said that the move prevented publication of the Friday morning
issue.
In a statement released Sunday, editors said they would ``not be
deterred by these practices from continuing to publish'' and serving as
a ``strong critical voice defending the national rights of our
people.''
Officials from Arafat's Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip said
only that they would investigate the report.
Aside from being an exercise in press censorship, the confiscations at
Al-'Ummeh also signalled further attempts by Arafat to assert authority
beyond the Gaza self-rule zone into the West Bank.
Israel and the PLO are negotiating a handover of the West Bank to PLO
autonomy, and have set a July 1 deadline for reaching agreement. Gaza
achieved autonomy last May.
Last summer and fall, Arafat's government shut down an east Jerusalem
published daily An Nahar, for a month. It also barred distribution of
three other Jerusalem-based newspapers in Gaza, protesting their
coverage of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty and Islamic militant
opponents of the PLO.
