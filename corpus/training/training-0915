U.S. Embassy in Bulgaria to Suspend Some Services 
The U.S. Embassy in Bulgaria will suspend some of its services, as
President Bill Clinton failed to reach an agreement with the congress
on the 1996 federal budget.
According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, the consular sector of the
U.S. embassy will suspend issuing visas to non-Americans, except
diplomats, government officials and those related with humanitarian
aid.
The embassy will resume its normal operations after President Clinton
approves the budget for non-emergency affairs.
