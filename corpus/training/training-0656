Putin Urges Effort to Strengthen Russia 
President Vladimir Putin urged Russians on Monday to make their country
a united and strong power, Interfax News Agency reported.
Putin made the appeal in a speech delivered at a banquet marking the
10th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Russia's
Sovereignty, it reported.
The Supreme Soviet of Russia, then a republic within the Soviet Union,
passed the document on June 12, 1990, proclaiming " absolute
sovereignty" of Russia over the Soviet Union and setting the pace for
the eventual disintegration of the Union.
June 12 was originally known as Independence Day for Russia, but
authorities later renamed it National Day on the grounds that the
country has never been a colony.
The document completed the entire epoch and set Russia on a new course
of development, said Putin.
People thought it simple to build a new state 10 years ago, but the
illusions had to be given up quickly, Putin admitted.
"Now, we know how hard it is to reform the economy," he noted.
Putin took over from Boris Yeltsin as Russia's second president since
the breakup of the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991. He was officially
sworn in early last month.
Yeltsin, who resigned abruptly on New Year's Eve and appointed Putin as
the acting president, attended Monday's banquet at the Kremlin,
Interfax reported.
In the speech, Putin said he encountered many disappointed and confused
people during his tour around the country.
"Our sacred duty is to show them the way to the end of the tunnel
today," he said. "Together, we will make Russia a united and strong
power."
