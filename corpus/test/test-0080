Murray Fuhrman, Radiologist, 82
Dr. Murray Fuhrman, a radiologist whose 50-year career was spent in
medicine, research and teaching, died June 30 at his home in New York.
He was 82.
The cause was congestive heart failure, family members said.

Scotland and during the Spanish Civil War, organized and headed a
British medical surgery unit in support of Republican forces.
After returning to the United States, he completed a residency in
thoracic surgery in 1940, but chose to enter the newly developing field
of radiology. He began private practice in 1941 and was a co-founder of
Parkway Hospital in Forest Hills, N.Y.
Fuhrman was among the physicians invited in 1949 to the Oak Ridge
Institute of Nuclear Studies in Tennessee, where he worked on one of
the early programs in nuclear medicine.
He also taught medical students at the State University at Stony Brook,
