The Singaporean ambassador to the Philippines has been recalled on the
orders of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Philippine Foreign Secretary
Roberto Romulo announced Tuesday.
Romulo said the recall of Ambassador Tang Seng Chye came after Filipino
complaints against him. He gave no details on the complaints.
On Monday, Philippine President Fidel Ramos suspended the posting of
Philippine ambassador to Singapore, Alicia Ramos, and nine other
diplomats who are or were based in Singapore, for allegedly not doing
enough to prevent a Filipina maid, Flor Contemplacion, from being
executed there.
