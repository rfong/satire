Afghan Ismailiya sect leader supports Karzai administration 
The leader of Afghanistan's Ismailiya religious minority Wednesday
backed the country's interim administration and said Afghans would
eventually choose ex-king Mohammed Zahir Shah as their leader.
"It has been only around 40 days since the establishment of this
government. Things cannot be perfect during this short period and it
will take time until they get settled," Sayed Shah Naser Naderi, the
London-based leader of the Islamic religious minority, told AFP.
In a telephone interview, he said his followers have already started
returning from neighbouring Pakistan to their homes, located mainly
around the stragetic town of Pulikhumri in the northern province of
Baghlan.
"Between 100 to 200 families out of a total of around 50,000 people in
different cities of Pakistan have gone back," he said.
There is no Ismailiya representative in the present administration led
by ethnic Pashtun royalist Hamid Karzai, which took office in December
for six months in line with the inter-Afghan power-sharing deal reached
in Germany the same month, Naderi said.
"We were not invited, nor we had the intention to take part," he said.
Last October, Naderi was in Rome to lend his support to Zahir Shah, who
many believe will be able to reunify the central Asian nation, divided
by 23 years of non-stop conflict.
According to Naderi, no prominent Ismailiya leaders have been based
inside the country since the Taliban militia overran their centre of
power of Pulikhumri in 1998, along with other northern provinces.
Sayed Ja'far Naderi, who is Naderi's nephew and was once the sect's
military leader, is currently in the Uzbek town of Termez, on the
border with northern Afghanistan, he said.
There were reports that Ismailiya followers, led by ex-army general
Hesamuddin Khan, had last month attacked forces loyal to defence
minister Qasim Fahim who now control Pulikhumri.
Memebrs of the Naderi family were close allies of Zahir Shah, who ruled
Afghanistan between 1933 to 1973 when he was dislodged in a coup that
sent him into self-exile in Rome.
The ex-monarch is expected to return to Afghanistan in March to
supervise the traditional Loya Jirga, or tribal grand assembly, to
choose a two-year interim government.
"I think the people will choose him as their president; there is no one
else to have his stature. He is popular and internationally
recognized," the religious minority leader said.
The Taliban, which was toppled last November a month after the start of
a US air campaign in Afghanistan, did not recognize the rights of
religious minorities.
