Horst Kohler, managing director of the International Monetary Fund

tour which will start on May 31, the IMF announced Tuesday.
During his Asia tour, Kohler also will visit Thailand, South Korea,
Indonesia, and India.
"The purpose of Mr. Kohler's trip is to hear perspectives on critical
issues facing the global economy," the IMF said in a brief statement.
"He is particularly interested in the views of Asian countries on the
role of the IMF, which will be an important input in the consideration
of reform of the institution," the IMF added.
