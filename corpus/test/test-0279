Japanese special envoy to work on Middle East peace 
A special envoy of Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will leave
here Sunday for Egypt, Israel and the Gaza Strip in a bid to assist the
Middle East peace process, it was announced Tuesday.
The envoy, Nobuo Matsunaga, will make a "direct high-level appeal to
the parties concerned with a view to advancing the peace process," the
Japanese foreign ministry said in a statement.
Matsunaga, a former Japanese ambassador to the United States, was
scheduled to have talks with leaders of Egypt, Israel and the
Palestinian authority about the situation in the Middle East, the
statement said.
It noted that Japan had extended more than 220 million dollars "for
Palestinian assistance to improve the environment" for the peace
process.
Japan has also taken part "positively" in multilateral talks and
economic summits to back the peace accord, the statement said.
It added that a Japanese ground force unit had been deployed since
February with UN peace-keeping forces on the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights.
