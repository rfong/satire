US says Aristide has gone all out for his return party 
US officials said Tuesday they were hoping to persuade Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to cut down a list of guests he has
drawn up to celebrate his return to his homeland Saturday.
Aristide, who was set to return after three years in exile, has invited
large numbers of people who have helped him in his quest to return to
power after the September 1991 military coup.
US officials said privately they believed the invitation list was
excessive and stressed fewer Americans should attend.
The exiled president was to return in grand style with three airplanes
carrying him and his entourage to Port-au-Prince.
The list of guests included Secretary of State Warren Christopher who
was to return Friday from a tour of the Middle East, Reverend Jesse
Jackson and several members of the Congressional Black Caucus.
It was not known whether Christopher would be able to accompany
Aristide.
President Bill Clinton announced Monday that Aristide would be
returning Saturday in line with an agreement reached last month between
the United States and Haiti's military rulers.
