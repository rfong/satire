New Home Sales in US Down by 7.7 Percent in April 
The U.S. Commerce Department reported today that the sales of new
single-family homes in April plunged by 7.7 percent, the sharppest
decline in six months.
The department said that sales of new homes decreased to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 772,000 from the 11 year high in March.
The report also showed a surprising rebound in March sales. The
Commerce Department originally reported a 2.5 percent decline, but
revised the figure sharply today to show a 2.0 percent gain. The
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 836,000 reached during the month is
the highest since April 1986, when it reached 857,000.
The turn-around in April is the largest decline in sales since last
October when sales fell 8.1 percent.
Year-on-year, however, the April sales rate was 4.2 percent higher than
in the same month last year.
Still, the supply of homes for sale at the end of April was the lowest
since August 1993. This inventory level would be depleted in 4.5 months
at the current sales rate.
The median sales price of new houses sold in April was 151,600 dollars,
up from 145,000 dollars in March and by 8.3 percent from a year
earlier.
Regionally, sales declined most sharply in the West, down by 16.5
percent. The sales fell 6 percent in the South and 2.9 percent in the
Midwest. They were unchanged in the Northeast.
