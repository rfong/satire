Dutroux bank accounts under investigation 
Investigators probing the Belgian child sex ring scandal are studying
the banking records of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux and his
accomplices, in the search for clues into the disappearances of several
children.
"The relationship between large deposits of money and the disappearance
of children can only be one of the hypothesis we are working on at this
time," said the prosecutor's office in Neufchateau, which is in charge
of the probe.
Investigators, nonetheless, were analysing all of the banking
transactions carried out in the last 10 years on several accounts held
by Dutroux, branded the "monster of Charleroi," and his alleged
accomplices.
The daily Le Soir said Monday that thousands of transactions were being
studied and added that Dutroux, his wife Michele Martin and their
accomplice Michel Lelievre had more than a dozen bank accounts, some of
them overseas.
Some of the banking transactions involved transfers between accounts or
loans, the daily said.
Several other newspapers said various transactions were detected at
dates coinciding with the disappearance of children whose whereabouts
are still a mystery.
For example, some 875,000 Belgian francs (29,000 dollars) were
deposited into one of Dutroux's bank accounts on August 26, 1992, three
weeks after the disappearance in Brussels of Loubna Benaissa, a
nine-year-old Moroccan girl, and two days after the disappearance of
16-year-old Laurence Mathues.
Another 490,000 francs (16,500 dollars) was transferred to four bank
accounts in August 1993, following the disappearance of a Dutch
teenager Tanja Groen in Maastricht, near the Belgian border.
Several deposits were also carried out in December 1993, shortly before
the January 1994 disappearance in Antwerp of Kim Heyrman and her
brother Ken. Kim was found dead a month later and her brother is still
missing.
The Neufchateau prosecutor's office has confirmed that all of these
transactions took place but would not elaborate as to whether they were
linked to the disappearance of the children or a peadophile ring.
Dutroux was arrested in August on unrelated theft charges and later led
police to the whereabouts of six of his victims, two of whom were found
alive in a cellar located in one of his numerous properties.
The bodies of four other girls were found buried at two other
properties.
