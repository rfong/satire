Myanmar Builds 123 Dams in 13 Years 
Altogether 123 dams have been built in Myanmar since late 1988 when the
present government took office, irrigating 688,500 hectares of
farmland, according to the Myanmar Ministry of Agriculture and
Irrigation Tuesday.
The 123 dams, which mostly lie in Bago, Mandalay and Magway divisions,
were built at a total cost of 40.49 billion Kyats (115. 68 million U.S.
dollars).
With the addition of the 123 dams in 13 years' time, the total number
of dams in the country has been brought to 261.
Besides, a total of 253 river-pumped water stations have so far been
set up in Myanmar, irrigating over 81,000 more hectares of farmland.
Myanmar has 18.225 million hectares of cultivable land, of which 9.315
million hectares have been put under crops and 19 percent of them are
cultivated through irrigation.
As agriculture is the mainstay of Myanmar's economy, the government is
giving priority to the development of the sector in order to produce
enough food to feed the nation's 52-million population.
Agriculture accounts for 37 percent of the country's gross domestic
product and 25 percent of its export value.
