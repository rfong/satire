San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds would lose the most money
of any player if the strike goes into the season, dlrs 42,350 per day
according to a study by The Associated Press.
Bonds, who has a base salary of dlrs 7.75 million, lost dlrs 1,349,713
during the strike last year, or dlrs 25,956 per day. He is followed
this year by Cecil Fielder of Detroit at dlrs 39,344 a day. Fielder
lost dlrs 12,022 per day during the strike in 1994, a total of dlrs
625,130.
Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox is third at dlrs 39,071, up from
dlrs 13,661 a day last year. Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle is next at dlrs
38,251, according to the study, which is based only on 1995 base
salaries. Griffey lost dlrs 24,590 per day last year.
When players struck last summer, 35 lost more than dlrs 20,000 per day
and only one, Bobby Bonilla of the New York Mets, lost more than dlrs
30,000. Bonilla lost dlrs 1,619,655 when the strike wiped out the final
52 days of the season, an average of dlrs 31,148 per day.
This time, 14 players would lose at least dlrs 30,000 per day and 64
would lose at least dlrs 20,000 per day.
Joe Carter of Toronto would lose the fifth most at dlrs 35,519 per day,
followed by Jeff Bagwell of Houston and Cal Ripken Jr. of Baltimore
(dlrs 32,787 each), Will Clark of Texas (dlrs 31,421), Lenny Dykstra of
Philadelphia (dlrs 31,148) and Gary Sheffield of Florida (dlrs 30,738).
It's impossible to accurately predict how much owners would lose. Last
year, they lost about dlrs 8.5 million for each day of the strike plus
another dlrs 140 million when the postseason wasn't played: a total of
dlrs 580 million.
However, the strike has caused a drop in ticket sales and advertising
and there's no telling how much revenue teams would take in this season
if the strike ends.
