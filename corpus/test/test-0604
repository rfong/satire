Australian Manufacturing Sector Grows Slowly 
A latest survey found that performance of the manufacturing sector was
generally positive during the March quarter but its gross product in
national accounts terms would grow marginally.
The survey, conducted by the Australian chamber of Manufacturing (ABM),
said today, "Given the importance of manufacturing to the overall
growth of the economy, this implies that national economic growth will
also slow in annual terms even with a modest pick up in activity in the
second quarter of 1997."
ACM chief executive Allan Handberg said in a statement that the small
increase in manufacturing growth in the March quarter and the predicted
0.6 percent growth in the June quarter would not offset the poor
performance in the second half of 1996 and annual growth was likely to
dip from one percent in 1996 to only 0.4 percent in the year to June
30.
The survey indicated that jobs in the manufacturing sector would fall
by 1.8 percent in the 1996-97 financial year and jobs would not grow
unless budget and other strategies were enacted to bolster confidence,
investment and exports.
The weak outcome in manufacturing meant GDP (gross domestic product)
would increase by about 2.6 percent in 1996-97, rather than the budget
forecast of 3.5 percent.
"While firms expect export trends to improve in the June 1997 quarter,
current trends suggest that this is unlikely to be realized unless
there is a significant drop in Australian dollar or new export markets
open more rapidly," said the survey.
According to the survey, manufacturing production would rise by 2.8
percent for the next 12 months while investment would lift by 6.1
percent and exports by just 0.3 percent.
