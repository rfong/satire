Israeli jets stage mock air raids on Palestinian base in Lebanon 
Israeli warplanes staged mock air raids on a base of a radical
Palestinian group south of Beirut on Wednesday, police said.
Four Israeli fighter-bombers flew at low altitude over positions of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC)
in Naameh, 15 kilometers (nine miles) south of Beirut, police said.
Lebanese police said initially that the Israeli warplanes had fired
missiles at the PFLP-GC positions. The police clarified later, however,
that no missiles were fired.
Three Palestinian guerrillas and a Lebanese civilian were wounded
Tuesday as Israeli aircraft pounded a base of the PFLP-GC in Lebanon
and knocked the radio station of the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah
militia off the air.
