Hijacked freighter reaches China: shipowner 
A freighter allegedly hijacked by renegade Chinese troops in the South
China Sea arrived on Wednesday at Shanwei, some 100 kilometres (60
miles) northeast of Hong Kong, the ship's owner said here.
An official of the Singapore-based HM Shipping and Trading said the
vessel, which left Singapore June 21 with 14 crew members, reached
Shanwei in China's Guangdong province between 0500 GMT and 0600 GMT.
The arrival of the ship, the 1,055-tonne bulk carrier Hye Mieko, was
disclosed by HM's managing director William Tay by telephone from
Shanwei, the official told AFP.
"Mr. Tay asked us to send a fax to the Chinese embassy here to contact
the authorities in China to assist in releasing the ship," she said.
The message had been sent to the embassy and there had been no reply
yet, she added.
In Hong Kong, the duty officer of the territory's Maritime Rescue
Coordination Centre said he had no information about the ship's
whereabouts.
"We tried to communicate with the vessel, but there was no reply," he
said.
In Kuala Lumpur earlier, the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) said
it had flashed fresh signals to ships in the South China Sea, in a bid
to locate the hijacked ship.
The vessel was reported by HM Shipping and Trading to have been
hijacked in Cambodian waters after it left Singapore on June 21 to
deliver two million US dollars' worth of cigarettes and photographic
supplies to Cambodia.
Chinese authorities in Beijing have dismissed as unjustified
suggestions of the possible involvement of rogue Chinese troops, while
denying any specific knowledge of the incident.
