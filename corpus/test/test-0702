Memorial Ceremony Honors Revolutionary Martyrs 
Ten thousands of students from more than 20 universities, middle and
primary schools in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province,
joined in memorial ceremonies held at the Yuhuatai Cemetery today to
honor revolutionary martyrs.
Yuhuatai is considered to be a sacred site for commemorating
participants in China's new democratic revolution and a base for
nationwide patriotic education.
More than two million people, both domestic and foreign, visited the
Mausoleum for Martyrs during 1997.
A continuous stream of visitors enter the memorial parks each year
prior to April 5th celebrations of the Qingming Festival, the festival
for visiting ancestral graves.
