Philippine peso to stay within the 49 to dollar range: central bank 
The Philippine peso is likely to remain within the 49 to the dollar
range amid a stable economic and political climate, the head of the
country's central bank said Tuesday.
"We think the peso will continue to be range-bound in the 49 level and
it is moving basically in tandem with other regionals against the
dollar," the bank's governor Rafael Buenaventura told reporters.
"The peso, which remained consistent within the 49 to the dollar level
since last week, is also getting support from fund inflows", he added.
Buenaventura said net portfolio inflows reached around 180 million
dollars in the three months to March.
A huge US pension fund's decision to pursue investments in the
Philippines would also help, he added.
The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) announced
Tuesday it is reversing a February decision to pull out of the
Philippines equities market.
"This is good news for us as we are the first of five countries
delisted by CalPERS, and this speaks well of us," Buenaventura said.
The Philippine peso closed at 49.505 to the dollar on Monday and traded
at an average of 49.531 to the greenback in the first half of the
trading day on Tuesday.
