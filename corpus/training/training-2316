African Energy Experts To Meet In Zimbabwe 
African energy experts will meet in the Zimbabwean capital Harare
tomorrow to prepare groundwork for the would solar summit to be held
here next year.
Next week, UNESCO Director-General Federicl Mayor will ask Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe to accept duty as the first chairperson of the
world solar commission aimed at directing action and projects at
government level, local reports said on Sunday.
The preparatory meeting, scheduled to open tomorrow morning at the
Harare International Conference Center, will mark Africa's entry into
the leading role in a world energy system.
Abundant, clean and equally distributed, Solar energy has never been
fully utilized for one reason or another, the reports said.
The UNESCO-initiated World Solar Summit Process (WSSP) is intended to
reverse the trend against the backdrop of the increased environmental
degradation, according to the reports.
WSSP, a grouping of leading energy experts, was formed two years ago to
popularize the use of solar enery by providing governments with
information and implementable strategies.
About 15 heads of state would become members of the solar commission to
be taking form in Harare this week.
