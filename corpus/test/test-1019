Hong Kong forces home another batch of Vietnamese boat people 
Hong Kong deported a group of 180 Vietnamese boat people on Wednesday
as Vietnam said it would send a task force to help speed the return of
the remaining 11,200 asylum seekers before the handover of the
territory to China next year.
A government spokesman said 180 Vietnamese boat people, comprising 82
men, 50 women and 38 children, left for Hanoi on two flights.
The batch to be repatriated under the official orderly repatriation
programme, was the third so far this month.
The majority of them arrived in Hong Kong in 1989 from northern Vietnam
and have been living in detention camps after failing to secure refugee
status, which could have allowed them to resettle in Western countries.
Over the past three months, the pace of return has accelerated as China
has insisted that all the camps be cleared before the territory returns
to Chinese sovereignty next July 1.
In Hanoi, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday Vietnam would
send a team of officials to Hong Kong to speed up formal processing of
boat people before their return.
Two years ago, Vietnam accepted only 60 forcible repatriations every
six to eight weeks. This month alone, the figure is expected to be
around a thousand, from some 700 in past months.
