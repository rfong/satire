New Sri Lankan premier launches Tamil peace push 
Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga on Wednesday announced the partial
lifting of an economic embargo on Tamil guerrilla-held territory in
northern Sri Lanka to clear the way for peace talks.
Kumaratunga said she expected the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) to respond positively to her unilateral action. She said
she would join moves to end the protracted separatist war which has
cost some 30,000 lives since 1972.
The Tigers earlier agreed to a ceasefire following a peace offer by
Kumaratunga who took office just two weeks ago and said they were
awaiting a "goodwill gesture" from the Colombo government.
