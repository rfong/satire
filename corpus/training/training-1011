Malaysia Has No Record of Producing Anthrax: Minister
"Nobody has done it before in Malaysia. The only reported case of
people infected in Malaysia was in 1967," he told reporters after
opening the International Conference on Ethics in the Biotechnology
Century here.
Following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, the
use of potential germ warfare agents such as anthrax has raised anxiety
in many countries including Malaysia.
It was not fair for the international media to cite Malaysia over the
issues of anthrax and Osama bin Laden, the U.S.' prime suspect in the
terrorist attacks, he said, adding "there is no evidence to link
Malaysia. Here, everything is peaceful."
Law also revealed that the Cabinet recently formed a committee on
biotechnology and biodiversity policy and his ministry had already
formed a working group to draft a biotechnology policy which would
guide the country in many areas such as agriculture and human resource
development.
He hoped they would finalize the policy before Malaysia hosts the
Bio-Malaysia 2002 International Biotechnology Symposium, Exhibition and
Business Partnering next year.
The objective of the international symposium to be held in October next
year is to promote Malaysia as a Center of biotechnology research,
education and industry.
Several hundred participants from home and abroad are attending the
two-day conference.
