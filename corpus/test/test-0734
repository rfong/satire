Chinese Woman Gives Birth to Septuplets, Has One Week To Choose
In the second such documented case ever, Jinan Huang, a 33-year-old
Shanghai woman, gave birth to septuplets Monday.
Jinan, who is in stable condition following the 31-hour delivery, has
been given one week by government officials to decide which child she
will keep.
"My husband and I have not decided for certain," said Jinan, speaking
to reporters from her hospital bed shortly after the miraculous birth.
"But we are very much considering keeping the second-born boy. He is
the heaviest and, therefore, the most likely to survive and tend to us
in our old age."
"We definitely do not want either of the two girls," Jinan's husband
Lin said. "Of that much we are certain."
The six children not selected will, in accordance with Chinese
multiple-birth law, be thrown off a mountaintop.
Since China's one-child-per-family law went into effect in 1983, more
than 65 million multiple-birth babies have been put to death in the
country.
Jinan, who said she had tried to have a baby for years, vehemently
denied taking fertility drugs, the use of which is punishable by death
in China. "I do not know how this happened," she said. "To my fellow
citizens and our nation's leaders, I wish to apologize for this
shameful and irresponsible multiple birth."
