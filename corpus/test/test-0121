Jiang Delivers New Year's Message on State Radio
In a new year's message broadcast worldwide today, President Jiang
Zemin said that people of all countries across the world should make
joint efforts to usher in a new century of enduring peace and common
development.
In his message to the audience of China Central People's Broadcasting
Station, China Radio International and China Central Television,
delivered here on the eve of 1998, Jiang expressed his confidence in
the future of China and the world by titling the message "March toward
a promising new century."
Describing 1997 as "a very important and very extraordinary year in the
Chinese history," President Jiang said that the Chinese people are
determined to carry forward the behest of Deng Xiaoping, who passed
away in February in Beijing, and promote the advancement of the cause
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
In 1997, he recalled, the Chinese government smoothly resumed its
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintained Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability under the principle of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy.
"Also this year, the Communist Party of China (CPC) successfully
convened its 15th National Congress, which, holding high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, summarized China's history over the
past century and worked out the program for action for the country's
development in the next century," he added.
He noted that China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive
continued to make progress in the past year, with high growth and low
inflation for the national economy, another bumper harvest in
agriculture, further deepening of enterprise reforms and further
improvement of people's lives.
Moreover, China's foreign economic and technological cooperation and
exchanges have continued to expand, while new achievements have been
scored in building democracy and the legal system, promoting ethical
and cultural progress and other social undertakings, he said.
