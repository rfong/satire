Talks open between Kono and Kantor 
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and US Trade Representative Mickey
Kantor began trade talks here shortly after 3:15 p.m. (19h15 GMT),
reporters on the scene said.
Upon arrival at Kantor's office in Washington, Kono said only: "I will
do my best."
US and Japanese negotiators hope to reach a compromise before the
midnight (0400 GMT Saturday) expiration of a deadline set by the United
States to convince Japan to agree to open its government procurement
markets for telecommunications and medical equipment.
Kantor was also expected to meet with Japan's Trade Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto at 8:00 p.m. (0000 GMT).
