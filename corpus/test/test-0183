Israeli lawyer calls for extradition of Priebke 
A Tel Aviv lawyer has asked Israel's supreme court to order an
extradition request for ex-SS captain Erich Priebke, who is in custody
in Italy, the daily Haaretz said Wednesday.
The lawyer, Shmuel Saadia, asked the court Tuesday to order Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the justice minister to seek Priebke's
extradition and an answer is expected within 10 days.
Saadia has already written to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging
him to take action after a Rome military court discharged Priebke on
August 1 despite finding him guilty of murder in a 1944 massacre of 335
Italian civilians in occupied Rome.
The tribunal said that because of the "mitigating circumstances" that
he was obeying orders, the time-frame of the offence under which
83-year-old Priebke was charged no longer applied.
However, he was taken back into custody almost immediately amid
widespread public outrage at the decision.
"Israel must, as the representative of the Jewish people, make an
effort to bring Priebke to justice," Saadia said in his request to the
supreme court.
Israeli law allows the government to make an extradition request in
cases concerning crimes against humanity or the Jewish people.
"If the Israeli government does not ask Italy for Priebke's
extradition, it risks rendering the law meaningless," the lawyer said.
Germany on Monday formally requested Priebke's extradition. The Italian
legal process is also not exhausted, as the prosecution is appealing.
