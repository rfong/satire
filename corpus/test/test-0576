Coach of Algeria's Soccer Team Resigns After Dispute With Govt
The coach of Algeria's national soccer team, Rabah Madjer, stepped down
Tuesday and blamed a lack of government financial support after the
team suffered two key losses in the African competition.
The Algerian Football Association approved his resignation request
Tuesday, one week Madjer submitted it, an AFA source said on customary
anonymity. A new coach has not yet been named.
Madjer's resignation came just 18 months after he took over the
national team. A strong personality whose battles with the Algerian
Sports Ministry were widely publicized, Madjer contends he was not
given the financial support needed to train his players overseas and
improve the season's record.
Under his guidance, the national team lost to Sudan last month and
Uganda last week, likely dashing their hopes of surviving the playoffs
in the African Cup of Nations.
In Algeria, soccer teams are not run as independent clubs, but are
under government jurisdiction. Coaches and players must seek official
approval before making decisions.
