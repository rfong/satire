Boeing plans to produce aircraft in Turkey: agency 
The US aircraft maker Boeing is planning to produce Boeing 737 commuter
planes at a plant to be set up in Turkey, Anatolia news agency on
Monday quoted a leading company official as saying.
Boeing's visiting executive board chairman Philip Condit told Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan at a meeting that the US company was ready
for any cooperation with the Turkish government, including "the local
production of Boeign 737s", Anatolia said.
Erbakan unveiled in January a plan to buy 54 commuter planes, worth
nearly four billion dollars, for Turkey's national company Turkish
Airlines.
Since then he has been meeting with top officials from leading civilian
aircraft producers, also including the US companies McDonnell Douglas
and Lockheed and Paris-based Airbus Industries.
Erbakan has said Turkey would favour the company which would propose
the highest Turkish industrial input for the planes to be supplied to
Turkish Airlines.
