Former Euro Disney executive gets dressing down, fine 
A former Euro Disney executive was fined here on Thursday for imposing
a dress code that banned beards for men workers and leather skirts for
women at the theme park at Marne-la-Vallee, east of here.
Jean-Yves Dubreuil, former social affairs director, was fined 3,000
francs (600 dollars) and ordered to pay 1,000 dollars damages for
adding a dress code headed "Disney Look" to employees' work contracts.
A court here was told that that the "Disney Look" code was removed from
work contracts at the beginning of this year.
Euro Disney delegates of the Communist-led CGT trade union welcomed the
judgement, but said the dress code was still in force in another form,
constituting a "violation of individual freedom."
The damages were awarded to the CGT.
The court heard that under the dress code, imposed in 1990 against the
advice of a government labour inspector, one woman employee was sacked
for wearing a cloth bracelet.
The court took no action against Euro Disney president Robert
Fitzpatrick and personnel director Pierre Janier, who faced the same
charge as Dubreuil. The prosecution had demanded a fine of 10,000
francs (2,000 dollars) for all three.
