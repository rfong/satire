Chirac, in a television interview at the summit in Benin, refused to
comment on the strike situation in France.
Chirac said that as a rule, he does not "comment on French domestic
affairs while traveling abroad."
"That does not mean I am not in permanent contact with the prime
minister and my aides at the Elysee Palace to be briefed on what is
happening," Chirac said.
