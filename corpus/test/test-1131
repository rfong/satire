An explosion blew out the windows at the Prince Edward Island
legislature Thursday, leaving at least one person hurt, witnesses said.
Bill McGuire of the Charlottetown Guardian newspaper said a person who
was outside on a bench was injured and taken to hospital by ambulance.
His condition was not known.
Most of the windows on north side of building were blown out, McGuire
said.
The legislature was in session at the time of the blast, at about 3:15
p.m. local time, and question period had just concluded.
A city police spokeswoman said only that ``we have an emergency on our
hands.''
Police have called for backup help from the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
