End to Deadlock on Women Reserved Seats Still Uncertain by Pan Xiaozhu
The four-party opposition alliance in Bangladesh, which is boycotting the
parliament session for long, apparently have no alternative, but to return
to the House to make way for the extension of the tenure of the 30 women
reserved seats in parliament.
The tenure of the 30 women reserved seats in the present 330- member
parliament will expire on April 4 next year if not extended by the
present parliament through constitutional amendment. The constitutional
amendment requires two-thirds majority. But the ruling Awami League
(AL) has no such power. The fate of the much talked about
constitution's 14th amendment Bill 2000 for retention of women's seats
is uncertain due to the opposition's long absence from the house.
Political Observers said the opposition will have to return to the
parliament for the passage of the Bill on women's seats, otherwise the
AL will pick up the issue to woo the women voters in its favor.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already urged the women voters on
Thursday not to vote the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jatiya
Party (JP) in the next general elections unless the opposition parties
support the pending bill of women's reserved seats in the parliament.
"The opposition must join parliament to support the bill to prove that
they need votes from the women community who constitute about half of
the voters. Otherwise, I would like to request the woman voters to
boycott BNP and JP in the next general elections," Hasina told a press
conference on Thursday.
The Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Law, Justice
and Parliamentary Affairs has finalized its report on the bill, seeking
a 10-year extension of the provision for women's reserved seats.
The report would be placed before the parliament in the coming session
beginning on November 9, official sources said.
Various women's bodies have been demanding 150 seats for women in a
450-member parliament and direct election to those seats.
On the demand for increasing the number of seats, neither the ruling
nor those in the opposition have spoken out their minds in clear terms.
The ruling party finds non-cooperation in the opposition but has not
yet proved its sincerity to the demand.
