Northern Ireland *snigger* to *chortle* sort itself out
In amazingly wonderful news, all those involved in the disgusting
situation in Northern Ireland are going to try and sort it out without
behaving like stupid and extremely dangerous schoolboys.
In what has come as an incredible shock, all parties involved in
solving the NI problem have decided they're actually going to stop
killing people, shake hands and get on with their own lives. Those with
deep-rooted beliefs are being told to just 'get over it', because
apparently life is 'too-short'.
Indeed, the number of people who have died because of NI has come up on
our calculator screen as: "Error: Number too large".
The IRA is supposedly preparing to bomb the crap out of anyone it cares
to, in response to the news.
