Yeltsin Closes Nuclear Sub Base City 
In the first such step since the Soviet Union collapsed, President
Boris Yeltsin ordered Thursday that outsiders be barred from a northern
city which houses a major nuclear submarine base.
During Soviet times, hundreds of cities housing military bases and
defense plants were closed to foreigners and even to Soviet citizens
who lived elsewhere. Most restrictions have been lifted since 1991.
It wasn't immediately clear what effect Yeltsin's decree would have on
the city of Polyarny, which was already closed under a previous law.
Polyarny is about 20 miles north of the port of Murmansk, in Kola Bay
on the Barents Sea.
Yeltsin's decree says the closure was needed ``to create a reliable
protection area for the safe functioning of the ship repair yard and
the Northern Fleet's bases.''
It was the first closure order Yeltsin has issued since he took office
in 1991. His office released the text of the decree, but refused to
comment on it.
Some 1.5 million to 2 million Russians still live in about 150 closed
cities run by the defense and nuclear power ministries, said Pavel
Felgengauer, a military commentator with the Segodnya newspaper.
