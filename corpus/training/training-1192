Iraq still pressing for faster contract approval on oil-for-food 
Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations on Friday called for the United
Nations to further speed up the approval of humanitarian contracts
under an oil-for-food deal.
The move came despite a commitment from the UN sanctions committee and
the UN secretariat on speeding up the process, obtained during a visit
here by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahhaf.
Iraqi ambassador Nizar Hamdoon, who went to the UN Security Council to
brief non-aligned Council members on the situation, noted the agreement
to speed up procedures.
But he said that the number of humanitarian contracts approved was
still too small, with only 15 approvals out of more than 240
applications submitted.
"If we see 60 or 70 (contracts) approved we'll feel better, not only in
their number but in the coverage of the whole food basket," Hamdoon
told reporters.
According to the Iraqi ambassador, both the sanctions committee and the
UN secretariat "share responsibility" for the continuing delays. The
sanctions committee approves each contract, while the secretariat
processes them and releases funds from an escrow account.
Sahhaf returned to Baghdad on Thursday after securing the agreement to
speed up the contract approval.
Under the oil-for-food agreement which has been in force since
December, Iraq can export two billion dollars worth of oil every six
months in return for food and medicine to help the sanctions-hit Iraqi
people.
But Iraq, which must use part of the oil money to defray the costs of
the UN operation, had complained that no food and medicine has yet
arrived in Iraq while distribution monitors are already in Baghdad.
Distribution is not expected to start until April.
Iraq has been under a crippling oil embargo since the 1990 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
