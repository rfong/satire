Turkish premier's plane almost crashed: press 
A Turkish Airlines flight which took Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan
to Iran nearly crash-landed at Tehran airport, the Turkish daily
newspaper Sabah reported Wednesday.
Quoting one of its correspondents on board, Sabah said the plane, an
Airbus A-340, narrowly avoided a disaster on Saturday in the Iranian
capital.
On Wednesday Turkish Airlines did not respond to the newspaper report.
According to Sabah, a member of Erbakan's delegation was using his
laptop computer on board at the approach, and that the machine's waves
intefered with the plane's electronic equipment.
The newspaper said that the misleading signals on the plane's
electronic display forced the pilot to switch off automatic pilot and
take over the controls manually moments before landing.
The pilot, Yilmaz Aytekin, did not land the plane straight away and
redirected it for a second try, which was successful, Sabah said.
