Cardinal tells Kim to solve SKorean labor crisis through dialogue 
South Korea's leading Catholic Friday said he had advised president Kim
Young-Sam to solve the dragging impasse over a controversial new labor
law through "dialogue and tolerance."
"I told Mr. President to solve the problem through dialogue and
tolerance," Cardinal Stephen Kim told reporters after emerging from 80
minutes of talks with the president on the controversial law, which
makes it easier for workers to be sacked.
A presidential spokesman independently told AFP the cardinal, whose
voice carries enormous moral weight in South Korea, had urged tolerance
and dialogue to solve the 23-day long dispute.
"The president said he would take the view into consideration," the
presidential spokesman added.
The cardinal, speaking to reporters at Seoul's Myongdong Cathedral on
his return from the meeting in the presidential Blue House, looked grim
and exhausted, an AFP reporter said.
"He (the president) listened to me very carefully," the cardinal said.
"The president may believe he must implement the law, but I hope that
will not happen," the cardinal replied when asked if he thought police
would raid Myongdong to arrest top labor leaders camped in the
cathedral grounds.
The impasse over the new law has dragged on for 23 days, since the
country exploded in a wave of strikes to protest the new labor law
rammed through parliament on December 26.
The unions say they will strike until the law is repealed. The
government says the law must stand.
