Tung Stresses Hong Kong's Advantages in Close Link With Chinese Mainland 
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), stressed Hong Kong's advantages in its close link with
the Chinese mainland in his policy address Wednesday.
"Hong Kong has benefited tremendously from the mainland's economic
growth over the past two decades. It is therefore not hard to see the
strong economic impetus we will derive from our country's sustained
aggregate economic growth in the coming decade, " Tung said.
China's approaching entry into the World Trade Organization ( WTO) will
result in the expansion and liberalization of the mainland market,
particularly service industries, in which Hong Kong will gain great
advantages and opportunities for development, Tung said.
China's accession to the WTO will also give a huge impetus to the joint
development of the regional economy by Hong Kong and Guangdong, he
continued.
Tung pointed out, to promote economic co-operation among Guangzhou,
Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, Hong Kong needs to strengthen
its infrastructure to facilitate economic flows.
"To further enhance Hong Kong's role as a passenger service hub, we
will continue to expand our air services network and consider long-term
plans to enhance our transport links with the Pearl River Delta to
serve the entire region," he said.
Tung described the strategic development of Western China launched by
the Chinese Central Government as an ambitious and long-term
undertaking.
"It will provide Hong Kong with many more business opportunities on a
continuing basis, and with our unique advantages, we in turn can make
significant contributions," he said.
