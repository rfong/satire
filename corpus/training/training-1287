Arafat sends urgent message to Bush to send back special envoy 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has sent an urgent message to US
President George W. Bush asking him to send his special envoy Anthony
Zinni back to the region to try to defuse growing tensions, his top
aide told AFP.
Arafat, trapped in Ramallah by Israel since December 3, sent the
message on Saturday, a day after Israeli tanks moved to positions in
the streets outside his West Bank headquarters.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was quoted in the daily Maariv
Sunday as saying "it is preferable that Arafat stays locked in Ramallah
instead of being expelled from the (Palestinian) territories as he
could cause more harm outside."
"He opens the windows of his Ramallah offices, he sees our tanks and
knows he has nowhere to go. He is dying to travel and fly off, it's
making him sick since he knows he is locked up in our jail," Sharon
said, quoted by the daily.
Israel has said Arafat will remain confined to Ramallah, a self-rule
Palestinian town just north of Jerusalem, until he arrests all the
people involved in the October slaying of an Israeli cabinet minister.
Zinni has made two visits to the region since November to try to push
for a ceasefire but his latest trip, scheduled for January 18, was
postponed indefinitely amid renewed violence.
