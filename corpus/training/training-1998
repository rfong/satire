Japan Secures Second Place after Beating Kazakhstan 5-1 
Japan trounced Kazakhstan 5-1 at the National Stadium on Saturday in a
World Cup qualifier, securing second place in the Asian zone group B.
Japan ended two-leg group qualifying with 13 points from three wins,
four draws and one defeat, and that means the United Arab Emirates, who
are to play South Korea Sunday at home, can do nothing to overtake the
Japanese.
South Korea already earned a berth in the 1998 finals in France by
securing top spot, while Japan will take on the Group A runners-up
Iran, who lost to Qatar 2-0 Friday, in a playoff for the third ticket
from Asia.
Yutaka Akita opened the account for Japan in the 11th minute and
Hidetoshi Nakata put his side 2-0 four minutes later. Masashi Nakayama
added one more in the 44th minute to close the first half.
Skipper Masami Ihara and substitute Takuya Takagi were also on target
in the second half, scoring in the 66th and 88th minutes, while Pavel
Yevteyev pulled one goal back in the 72nd-minute from a free kick.
