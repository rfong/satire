Briton Jailed for Stabbing Frenchman
A 43-year-old Briton was jailed on Saturday after admitting to fatally
stabbing a Frenchman after the match between England and Argentina.
According to judicial officials, Paul Birch confessed to the crime
after 10 hours of questioning by an investigating judge which ended in
the early hours of Saturday morning.
Birch was jailed in St-Quentin-Fallavier in the Isere region. He was
under formal investigation for murder -- one step short of being
formally charged.
Birch, an engineer from London, admitted to stabbing actor Eric Frachet
on the train from Lyon to Grenoble on Tuesday night, following
England's loss to Argentina in Saint-Etienne.
