Pope May Not Accept Invitation To Visit Northern Ireland
A decision will be taken this year as to whether the Pope will not or
will not visit Northern Ireland later this year.
His spokesman, Father Federico Mafioso, said that Mr. Ratzinger's
non-visit had been carefully discussed in the Vatican, and some had
said he shouldn't go, some had said he definitely shouldn't go within a
hundred miles of Ulster, and some had said he was off his trolley to
even talk about going near the place.
Democratic Unionist MP, the Reverend Ian Paisley, summed up the
difficulties, compromises and traditions of the Protestant community
there, when he stated: 'ULSTER IS PRAAATESTANT! NO POPE! NO SURRENDER!
U-D-A!!', though another unionist MP, David Trimble but it more
bluntly. 'The day the Pope sets foot in the 6 counties is the day I
play for Glasgow Celtic.'
A British Army spokesman also said: 'Should the Pope pay a visit to
Northern Ireland, we anticipate a few problems that will require extra
security - problems such as thousands of men attacking each other with
petrol bombs and bricks in the streets, hundreds of carbombs, sniper
attacks and house-burnings, and an orgy of drunken, uncontrollable
violence across the Province. So it will just be like any other
Saturday night here for us.'
This would be the first visit to Ireland by a Pope since 1979, when
Pope John Paul II didn't go to Northern Ireland, and even his non-visit
set off mass riots, effigy-burnings and shootings, so he clearly helped
bring peace to that part of the world.
Provisional Sinn Fein deputy gunman, Martin Minesaguiness, speaking
from his fortified, mined castle, said - 'It is a sad day for the Irish
people when a man of peace can't visit this country - and you know how
much the Provisional IRA love peace.' And then he continued - 'are the
microphones off? Good. He must be mad! You think those crazy Proddy
eejits would let him put a foot down here? He'd have more chance
setting foot on the moon.'
And an Ulster Volunteer Force spokesgun, Billy 'Rabid
Foaming-at-the-mouth Mad Dog' McKenzie said: 'The Protestant community
is not bigoted, and welcomes the Pope with courtesy and respect - as
long as he does a few simple things. Firstly, he must renounce his
Catholic faith, secondly, he must change his name to John Knox, and
thirdly, he must join the Rangers Fan Club and the Orange Order. I
think these demands are reasonable, and if he doesn't do them, he'll be
getting a Belfast kiss from me!'
Saint Tony Blair was unavailable for comment.
