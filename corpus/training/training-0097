UN Council Meets to Discuss Ways in Fight Against Poverty 
The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) began the 1999
substantive session here Monday with the intention of spear heading a
global crusade against poverty.
In his opening speech, ECOSOC President Paolo Fulci called on the
industrialized countries to do more in the world's fight against
poverty.
During the meeting from July 5 to 28, the ECOSOC will also try to carry
out its political plan to turn the last session of ECOSOC this century
into a "renaissance" of the council in order to re- establish a central
role for itself in world affairs.
