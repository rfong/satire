Seeking to discourage inflated or misleading claims by mutual funds and
other investment companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission
approved guidelines Wednesday on how rankings are used in advertising
and sales literature.
The new rules, which were proposed by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, will require ``prominent disclosure'' in
advertisements and sales literature of an investment company's ranking,
the number of companies in the category, the name of the category and
the period on which the ranking is based.
Over the years, mutual funds have resorted to all manner of creative
advertising, wooing holders of certificates of deposit to volatile bond
funds that play in the derivatives market, and trumpeting ``first
place'' status whether they were No.1 or No.600. Since word got out
that the NASD intended to act, however, the volume of such advertising
has ebbed.
``The increase in the number of investment companies, investment
company categories and ranking entities in recent years dictated the
need for explicit rules covering the use of rankings,'' said R. Clark
Hooper, vice president for advertising and investment companies
regulation at the NASD.
``The new guidelines will help investors make sound investment
decisions by providing more information about the meanings of mutual
fund and other investment company rankings,'' she added. ``We want to
see these guidelines prevent misleading advertising.''
The new rules, apply only to investment companies that use rankings in
their advertising and promotions. Mutual fund experts could not
estimate the number affected, but said it was a small percentage of the
total.
John Worth, a spokesman for the Vanguard group of funds, a leading
mutual fund family, said the company did not use any rankings in its
advertising. ``Past performance can't guarantee future results,'' he
said.
Many of the disclosure requirements released Wednesday are not new, Ms.
Hooper said. But she said they represented an effort by the NASD to
codify what needs to be done for a mutual fund to use rankings from
such services as Lipper Analytical Services and Morningstar in its
advertising.
``My biggest hope is that we will be providing the investing public
with enough information, prominently displayed when need be, that if
they don't understand it, they will know they need to ask questions,''
Ms. Hooper added.

Discussion about the need to draw up a set of guidelines began more
than a year ago at the suggestion of the Investment Company Institute,
the fund industry's trade assocation.
``We initiated this effort, strongly support these rules and think they
will be helpful,'' said Erick Kanter, vice president for public
information and marketing at the institute.
The guidelines approved Wednesday relate to advertising about rankings,
the time periods involved, fund category and disclosure about whether
rankings reflect multiple class or two-tier funds.
Ms. Hooper and others said that often the marketplace had acted as a
self-policing mechanism.
``The mutual fund industry is so competitive about this kind of
information that it is hard to argue that it is an abuse,'' said
Charles Trzcinka, a professor of finance at the State University of New
York at Buffalo and a former senior economist at the SEC.
``Most people are not inclined to run advertisements if their funds
have poor rankings,'' Trzcinka added. Nevertheless, he said, the move
``is certainly worth doing.''
Firms found in violation of the new rules would be subject to sanctions
or disciplinary action, Ms. Hooper said, with the penalty determined by
the degree of the violation.
Penalties ``could be as little as a warning letter or as severe as a
fine and/or suspension,'' Ms. Hooper said.
