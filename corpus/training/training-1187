Finnish PM Visits Shanghai 
Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi met with visiting Finnish Prime Minister
Paavo Lipponen here this evening.
Lipponen arrived here from Beijing this afternoon to continue his China
visit.
During the meeting, Xu briefed Lipponen on the city's new progress in
readjustment of industrial structure, urban construction and the
development of the Pudong New Area as well as the measures Shanghai has
taken to maintain economic development amid the adverse impact of the
Asian financial crisis.
Lipponen said that Finland hopes to further its economic and trade
cooperation with Shanghai and is prepared to contribute to the city's
economic growth, which is beneficial to both sides.
Finland has thus far established nine joint ventures in Shanghai with
an investment of more than 100 million U.S. dollars.
