LTCB/NNP responded/VBD that/IN the/DT move/NN by/IN Moody/NNP 's/POS was/VBD ``/`` regrettable/JJ ,/, as/IN our/PRP$ financial/JJ structure/NN is/VBZ improving/VBG steadily/RB ./. ''/''

NCB/NNP said/VBD the/DT Moody/NNP 's/POS action/NN was/VBD ``/`` unacceptable/JJ ''/'' and/CC prompted/VBD by/IN ``/`` total/JJ misunderstanding/NN as/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT concern/NN over/IN management/NN of/IN our/PRP$ bank/NN ./. ''/''

Moody/NNP 's/POS said/VBD the/DT reviews/NNS were/VBD triggered/VBN by/IN concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT impact/NN of/IN deregulation/NN of/IN the/DT Japanese/JJ financial/JJ markets/NNS on/IN the/DT activities/NNS of/IN the/DT three/CD banks/NNS ./.

A/DT lower/JJR rating/NN is/VBZ not/RB good/JJ for/IN an/DT establishment/NN that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB have/VB access/NN to/TO savings/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT real/JJ impact/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT measure/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO reinforce/VB foreign/JJ suspicions/NNS of/IN Japanese/JJ banks/NNS ./.

Traditionally/RB these/DT banks/NNS march/VBP to/TO the/DT same/JJ tune/NN in/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, but/CC more/RBR and/CC more/RBR they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN clearly/RB diverging/JJ ./.

Such/PDT a/DT narrow/JJ margin/NN is/VBZ barely/RB sufficient/JJ to/TO permit/VB a/DT profit/NN and/CC the/DT market/NN is/VBZ abuzz/JJ with/IN recurring/VBG rumors/NNS about/IN NCB/NNP 's/POS imminent/JJ collapse/NN ./.
