Hilton slams Pamela Anderson as "Rabid Scavenging Hyena"
A livid Paris Hilton has slammed Pamela Anderson's choice of bridegroom as
'the rabid scavengings of desperate hyena' amid news that the 40 year-old
busty peroxide bombshell is set to marry One Fright in Paris co-star Rick
Solomon.
The 26 year old porno-flick diva has told friends of her sense of
betrayal as Anderson announced plans for a Las Vegas wedding to Solomon
later this year.
"She's a predatory bitch desperate for celebrity cast-offs," Hilton
said in Bel Air today, "because nothing else will ever make her look
glamorous or desirable or fuckable like me."
Hilton and Solomon, 38, dated a while, rising to prominence with the
internet showing of their self-promotional infra-red porn video that
subsequently made it on general release as an x-rated must-see.
But at 12 years her senior Rick Solomon soon tired of the peroxide
heiress.
For Anderson it will be marriage No 3 having dumped Kid Rock and Tommy
Lee during a tempestuous few years devoted to testing the elasticity
limits of her internal organs.
