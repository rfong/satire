Jiang Zemin, Fidel Castro Hold Talks (1)
They expressed the unanimous view at their 3-hour sincere and friendly
talks in the Great Hall of the People here today.
Extending a warm welcome to Castro, president of the Council of State
and president of the Council of Ministers of Cuba, Jiang described the
Cuban leader's current visit as a magnificent event in the Sino-Cuban
relations.
Jiang said that "Castro's visit would help enhance mutual understanding
and push forward the friendship and the relations of cooperation
between the two countries."
Jiang said he still remembered clearly that he was accorded a grand
reception by President Castro, the Cuban government and its people
during his visit to Cuba two years ago.
Since then, the exchanges and cooperation between the two countries
have kept expanding and encouraging results have been achieved, Jiang
said, adding that the frequent contacts between senior leaders of the
two countries would enhance mutual understanding and play an active
role in promoting the bilateral relations.
In international affairs, Jiang noted, China and Cuba have cooperated
closely and supported each other. "China appreciates the Cuban
government for its support to China in the issues of Taiwan, Tibet and
human rights," he said, adding that the Chinese government will, as
always, support Cuba in its just struggle to safeguard national
independence and state sovereignty and oppose outside interference.
Jiang stressed that the strengthening of friendship and cooperation
between the two countries is of great significance in the current
international situation and also accords with the fundamental interests
of the people of the two countries. China would continue to develop the
bilateral relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, Jiang stated.
