Pakistan cabinet approves plan to launch communication satellite 
The Pakistani cabinet on Wednesday approved in principle a proposal to
launch a Pakistani communication satellite system to be called PAKSAT,
officials said.
The 220-million dollar project would be carried out by Alcatel Espace
of France, an official statement said, without indicating a timeframe
for the launching of the proposed satellite.
The company will execute the project under a 15 year licence and the
satellite will carry 26 transponders, a set up that upon receiving a
designated signal emits a radio signal of its own.
The project was initiated in 1993 and a letter of intent was issued to
the company in April 1996.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who chaired the cabinet meeting, directed
the communication ministry to negotiate further possible concessions
with the French company, the statement said.
