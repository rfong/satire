Washington calls for immigration talks with Cuba 
The United States called for talks with Cuba Monday to encourage legal
immigration from the communist country and prevent more refugees from
attempting to cross the Florida Straits in makeshift rafts.
Deputy Secretary of State for political affairs Peter Tarnoff told a
news conference that the United States wanted to "encourage the legal
immigration from Cuba."
He said that negotiations on widening legal departures could be held in
the framework of regular bilateral meetings on immigration held since
1984.
Under a US-Cuban agreement, the United States grants up to 20,000
immigration visas a year to Cubans but officials say there are never
enough applicants to fill the quota.
Cuban authorities have traditionally blocked immigration to the United
States, forcing thousands of potential immigrants to brave the
treachurous 144-kilometer (90-mile) crossing in homemade rafts and
rubber dinghys.
Only 2,000 Cubans have been granted visas under the US-Cuban agreement
since October 1993 while more than 10,000 Cubans have been picked up at
sea by US coast guard since January 1, 1994.
"There is substantial room ... because there are not enough
applicants," said Doris Meissner, commissioner of the immigration and
naturalization service.
She added that the administration would encourage Cubans emigres in the
United States to present visa applications for their relatives.
