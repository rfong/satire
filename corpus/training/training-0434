O'Brien to return to decathlon competition in April 
Dan O'Brien, America's three-time decathlon world champion, will return
to competition at the Mt SAC Relays in Califwtnda on April 21, his
first decathlon competition in four years.
"Contrary to what have been written, I've never really said I was
retiring," O'Brien said.
"I was unfortunate these last couple of years each time I tried to come
back to the top," he said. "I hope this time I won't be bothered by any
more injuries so I can accomplish a few good things before I retire."
While O'Brien has competed in a handful of scattered races, the 1996
Olympic champion hasn't competed in a decathlon since his victory at
the 1998 Goodwill Games.
The 35-year-old said he wanted to surpass 9,000 points at the US
championships next June.
"It's possible. It has always has been one of my goals in my career.
I'm pretty confident because you think the decathlon is wide open. "
O'Brien established the world record at 8,891 points in September 1992
in Talence, France.
That mark was broken by Czech Thomas Dvorak with a total of 8,994 in
1999, and Czech Roman Sebrle broke the 9,000-point barrier with 9,026
in 2001.
As well as the Mt. SAC Relays, O'Brien is also planning to compete at
the Modesto Relays on May 5 and the Prefontaine Classic Grand Prix
meeting in Eugene, Oregon, on May 26 and the national championships
which start at Stanford, California, on June 21.
