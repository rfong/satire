China Passes Guidelines for Tapping Underground Water in Arid NW Region
China today passed guidelines for searching for underground water
resources in the dry northwestern region, according to sources with the
group for detecting northwest underground water resources based in this
capital of Shaanxi Province.
The guidelines detailing plans for the next decade are aimed at
providing scientific strategies for making use of underground water
resources in the region, which covers some 3.3 million square
kilometers and includes Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, and the
Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions.
China began a project four years ago to tap underground water to ease
the water shortage for 80 million people in the northwest region, and
this has helped verify some one billion cu m of underground water
reserves under the Loess Plateau and the Taklimakan Desert, equal to a
combined holding capacity of ten large reservoirs.
Experts with the program developed a technique for sinking wells for
karstic water located deep under the arid land. The project now helps
pump out 660,000 cu m of high-quality water daily for the region.
