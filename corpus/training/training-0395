Suspected 36 Indian insurgents arrested in Bangladesh: report 
Thirty-six Indian insurgents from Manipur state have been arrested by
border guards along with two local contacts in northeastern Bangladesh,
newspapers reported here Tuesday.
The Bangladesh Rifles said the group, arrested late Sunday, would be
sent to a court in Sylhet district, the Daily Star newspaper reported.
The two Bangladeshis, identified as Osen Singh and Ratan Mani Singh,
belonged to the Manipuri tribe, it added.
The arrests came after Dhaka and New Delhi agreed not to allow
insurgents to use their respective territories.
The agreement has led to peace initiatives to end a decades-old
insurgency as well as to the repatriation of thousands of tribesmen to
their homes in southeastern Bangladesh hill districts from India's
Tripura state.
In a related development, the pro-opposition New Nation daily reported
Tuesday that India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) would open a
"monitoring office" in Dhaka.
The CBI's main objective would be to check Indian insurgents attempting
to operate from Bangladesh.
No independent confirmation was available.
