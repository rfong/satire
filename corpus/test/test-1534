French PM Praises Egypt's Economic Reforms 
Visiting French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Sunday praised Egypt's
economic reforms at the opening ceremony of the largest French trade
fair ever held in the Middle East.
"Egypt is reaping good results which other countries may envy," Jospin
said at the ceremony with his Egyptian counterpart Kamal El-Ganzouri.
Egypt has been following a restructuring and privatization program
under the International Monetary Fund guidance since the early 1990s.
A five-day fair staged in Cairo's international conference center,
Francexpo 99 has been designed as a showcase of advanced technology. It
has attracted 200 French and other European companies in the energy,
financial, agricultural, high-tech and other sectors.
France was determined to boost its political, economic and cultural
ties with Egypt, Jospin told a banquet Saturday night several hours
after his arrival.
France is Egypt's third largest trading partner. In 1998, trade volume
between the two countries amounted to 5.7 billion Egyptian pounds (1.7
billion billion U.S. dollars). Egypt imports some 6 to 8 percent of its
goods and technology from France.
Jospin and El-Ganzouri signed several agreements on Saturday. The deals
involve building two electrical power plants, computerizing a library,
contributing to agricultural, social and environmental projects, and
writing off 50 million dollars of Egyptian debt.
Jospin's two-day visit is the first by a French prime minister since
1992..
