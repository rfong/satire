Russian troops in Grozny are also to withdraw to bases on the outskirts
or to new camps, leaving the city in joint control of Chechen rebels
and Russian units.
The joint city district headquarters are to be set up by 1100 GMT
Saturday, the report said.
Further demilitarisation would take place under accords reached in June
in which Russian troops would leave Chechnya and the rebels would
disarm.
The latest crisis began August 6 when rebels captured most of Grozny
from the Russians in a stunning surprise offensive.
In more than a week of ferocious fighting, the Russians were unable to
regain control of Grozny and the interim commander, General Konstantin
Pulikovsky, late Monday threatened an all-out assault using the whole
range of artillery and aviation.
Pulikovsky's ultimatum to Grozny's civilians to leave within two days
was annulled after Lebed arrived in Chechnya late Wednesday.
Tens of thousands of civilians fled the city in panic after
Pulikovsky's ultimatum, abandoning their homes and often coming under
fire as they tried to escape.
Officials said between 80,000 and 200,000 civilians remained in the
city, unable to leave, making a bloodbath unavoidable if the huge
Russian assault was carried out.
Claims of ceasefire violations kept up even as Lebed and Maskhadov met.
Interfax quoted an unnamed Russian military source as saying that 50
Russian soldiers were killed in heavy fighting in central Grozny late
Thursday with Chechen guerrillas surrounding Russian soldiers.
An interior ministry spokesman said in Chechnya earlier that rebels had
killed four Russian interior ministry troops, wounded 18 and taken
three prisoner in attacks Thursday after a threatened Russian assault
on Grozny was called off.
There was no independent confirmation.
In Washington, a US spokesman welcomed the accord, saying it was "a
very positive step forward."
The Chechnya war was triggered by a massive Russian military
intervention aimed at crushing the rebels' 1991 independence bid.
