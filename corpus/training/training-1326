Mswati Names New Prime Minister 
Swazi monarch King Mswati iii today named former Finance Minister
Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini as the kingdom's new prime minister, the
South African Press Association has reported.
Mswati made the announcement at a traditional gathering of Swazis at
his Ludzidzini royal residence near the capital Mbabane.
Dlamini, who was a popular and respected finance minister, is
considered a modernist in a country where traditionalists wield
considerable influence.
Dlamini, currently a Director with the World Bank-Internatioal Monetary
Fund's African region, succeeded Prince Mbilini Dlamini, whose
"retirement" was announced by the king two months ago.
The new prime minister was expected to lead the government through the
constitutional reform promised by Mswati earlier this year, said the
report.
The reform was aimed at gently transforming the African kingdom into a
state of democracy, while still retaining the Swazi's culture,
traditions and customs.
Since Swaziland's independence in 1968, the post of prime minister has
been restricted to members of the royal family, the Dlaminis, the royal
clan which bears Mswati's surname.
Since Prince Mbilini's dismissal, Deputy Prime Minister Sishayi Nxumalo
has been acting as prime minister.
Swaziland is the only southern african country in which political
parties have been banned since 1973, and the monarch king rules the
kingdom by royal decree.
Swaziland has been plagued by industrial strikes and political unrest
since January, aimed at pressurising the king to introduce democratic
changes. enditem =07261906 =07261903 NNNN 03:06 03:07 g # PAB
