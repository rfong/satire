ADB Organizes Workshop for South Asian Countries 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is to organize a six-day workshop from
Sunday for the South Asian countries on the economic analysis of
projects, the bank said Saturday.
Thirty-five representatives from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will participate in the
workshop, the bank said in a press release.
It said that the workshop aims to introduce the bank's approach to the
economic and financial analysis of projects at different stages of the
project cycle to senior government officials.
"Through the workshop it is intended that participants will gain a
better understanding of the bank's requirements for financial and
economic analysis," it said.
"This will enable the officials to assist their respective governments
and the ADB in improving the quality of projects in the design stage,"
it added.
A similar workshop was organized by the ADB in the Kyrgyz Republic in
October 1998 for the benefit of the Central Asian countries and
Mongolia.
A third and the last workshop in this series is planned in Hanoi,
Vietnam in January 1999 for countries of the Greater Mekong region, the
ADB said.
All the three workshops are financed by the bank under a regional
technical assistance project, it added.
