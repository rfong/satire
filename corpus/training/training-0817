Coca-Cola in Philippines to invest 1.7 billion dollars 
The local Philippine bottler of US-based Coca-Cola Co. is to invest 45
billion pesos (1.7 billion dollars) in expansion projects over five
years, officials said in a statement Thursday.
Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc. (CCBPI) inaugurated Wednesday its
21st bottling facility in the town of Santa Rosa, south of here, as
part of the expansion project, it said.
The investment, to begin 1997, would "meet growing product demand and
strengthen (Coca-Cola Bottlers') leadership position in the country,"
the statement said.
The beverage firm holds a market share of 75 percent in the
Philippines.
Coca-Cola's new plant will have an annual initial production capacity
of 31 million cases, it said.
CCBPI is a joint venture between the Coca-Cola Co. which holds 30
percent, and the Philippines' San Miguel Corp., which holds 70 percent.
