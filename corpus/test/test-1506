Turkish minority protest poll annulment 
Around 6,000 Bulgarians of Turkish descent demonstrated at the southern
town of Kardjali Saturday against the annulment of local elections that
a pro-Turkish movement was declared to have won, national radio
reported.
The demonstrators had travelled from all over the country to Kardjali
to protest at a decision by a regional court to annul the election of a
candidate of the Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF) to the mayor's
office ahead of a candidate of the country's ruling Socialist
(ex-communist) party last November.
The court said the MRF candidate, Rasim Musa, who defeated the
Socialist candidate by 658 votes, had received votes from 1,271
electors who had come from Turkey or from other regions of Bulgaria.
The annulment of the vote was announced on February 5, with a
by-election called for next May.
The MRF parliamentary group boycotted last week's proceedings in the
national assembly in protest at the decision.
The protestors, backed by opposition deputies, rallied under the slogan
"democracy in danger."
Bulgarian radio said the demonstration had passed off peacefully.
