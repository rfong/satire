Differences still need to be ironed out after Hebron accord: Arafat 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Wednesday said there were still
nearly three dozen points to be ironed out with Israel in the
post-Hebron phase of the Middle East peace process and called for
Egypt's help.
Arafat, speaking after separate talks in Cairo with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid,
also repeated his determination to "walk together with Israel on the
path of peace."
"There are 34 points of conflict still with Israel including the issue
of the Palestinian men and women held in Israeli jails, the safe
passage (between Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho)," and air and
sea ports for the autonomous territory of Gaza, Arafat said after
briefing Mubarak and Abdel Meguid on the Hebron deal.
The Hebron accord's "note for the record" says negotiations on safe
passage, the Gaza port and airport and economic, financial, civilian
and security issues were to be resumed immediately.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Israeli army withdrew from 80
percent of the West Bank town on Friday and handed the city's
administration over to Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
The Israeli army remains in control of 20 percent of Hebron, which
contains enclaves where 400 Jewish settlers live and the Cave of the
Patriarchs -- a Moslem and Jewish religious site.
Arafat said "arrangements" will be made for the Cave of the Patriarchs.
"We will discuss this directly with the Israelis," he added.
He also reiterated that the creation of a Palestinian state will be
announced, despite Israel's firm opposition, "after the end of the
interim period."
Arafat, who arrived from Rome early Wednesday after attending the
Socialist International, met privately with Mubarak for one hour before
seeing Abdel Meguid.
No statement was issued at the end of the talks between the two
presidents.
But before leaving Arafat said: "We ask that the Egyptian efforts which
accompanied us every step of the way so far to continue during the
implementation phase."
"The most important thing now is to implement everything we have agreed
upon, and I felt that President Mubarak is ready to help us continue
this on this difficult course," he added before going back to Gaza by
helicopter.
"After 87 members of the Israeli Knesset voted in favour of the accord,
the Israeli people want peace and we must walk together on the path of
peace for the sake of the coming generations," he added.
The Palestinian minister for local administration, Saeb Erakat, was to
brief the permanent delegates of the Arab League on Thursday on the
Hebron handover accord reached with Israel last week, Arafat said.
Before leaving Arafat also handed the Saudi, Yemeni and Algerian
ambassadors in Cairo messages for their country's leaders outlining the
Hebron accord.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa said meanwhile that the Hebron
accord between Israel and the Palestinians was "an important step
towards the creation of a Palestinian state."
"Peace in the Middle East will not be achieved without creation of a
Palestinian state," Mussa said Tuesday. He pledged Egyptian support for
the Palestinian side in reaching that objective.
