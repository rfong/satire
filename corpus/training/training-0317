Civil Servants Important to HK's Transition 
Civil servants constitute an important force to maintain Hong Kong's
long-term stability and prosperity and to ensure a smooth government
handover in Hong Kong in mid-1997, a senior Chinese official said here
today.
Zheng Guoxiong, vice-director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch,
made the remark at a gathering held this evening to mark the first
anniversary of the founding of the Hong Kong Former Senior Civil
Servants Association Limited.
He said that the civil servants are very important for the realization
of the principle of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and Hong Kong's high-degree autonomy.
"We hope that after 1997 the overwhelming majority of the civil
servants, including those of foreign origin, will stay and continue to
serve the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
Hong Kong citizens," he said,
Zheng spoke highly of the association's efforts in the past year to
promote the contacts and exchanges between local civil servants and the
Chinese government officials and to stabilize the ranks of civil
servants, adding that it has also contributed to the consultancy work
about Hong Kong's smooth transition.
He said, "We expect to have more chances to exchange views and enhance
contacts with civil servants."
Chan Nai-keong, chairman of the association, said that civil servants
are important to the implementation of the principles of one country,
two systems and that of Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong.
He said that the Chinese government has recognized the important
function of the civil servants which will play an important role in
Hong Kong's return to its motherland.
He said that his association will continue to promote the exchanges
between the Chinese government officials and civil servants of Hong
Kong government.
More than 100 former and incumbent senior civil servants and Chinese
officials attended the gathering.
