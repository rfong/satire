Cyprus Police to Ensure Peaceful Motorcycle 
The Cyprus police will use all means to avert any incidents on a
motorcycle demonstration Sunday by Cypriot and European bikers along
the U.N.-controlled buffer zone, police chief Panikos Hadjiloizou said
here today.
Around 120 motorcyclists started a 10-day ride from Berlin Friday,
which they said is a demonstration against the Turkish occupation of
northern Cyprus, and will arrive in Cyprus on August 10.
Another 7,000 Cypriot motorcyclists will join them in an attempt to
cross, through Ledra Palace Check Point in Nicosia, to the northern
part of the island, and then to ride to coastal town of Kyrenia.
Speaking after a meeting between police and the local authorities of
towns or villages bordering the route of the demonstrations,
Hadjiloizou said "we are determined not to allow anybody to create any
incidents and we shall use all available means for a peaceful
anti-occupation ride."
Local authority leaders expressed their readiness to contribute in a
positive manner toward the smooth running of the ride.
The chief of police said that police have received information that
"some participants in Sunday's ride might create certain incidents and
we want to prevent any of these people from causing any trouble."
"We have no intention of confronting anybody but we do not want to
allow anybody to disturb the peace of the people who live in the area,"
he stressed.
The U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has urged all people
on this divided eastern Mediterranean island to respect the
180-kilometer-long buffer zone, which separates the island into two
parts.
The Cyprus government has also shown concern over the event which could
have an adverse effect on the Cyprus problem.
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides has said that "We do not
wish to see any confrontation between the National Guard and the
Turkish occupation forces, nor do we want the bikers to give any
pretext to the Turkish army to move into the buffer zone and endanger
people living in areas bordering the U.N.-controlled zone."
A meeting was held Monday at the Foreign Ministry to discuss the
measures to be taken to avert an incidents.
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides said after the meeting that it was
important to ensure not only the safety of those participating in the
ride but also the security of the state.
U.N. Secretary-General's resident representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel, who also attended the meeting, said that people have the right
to protest, provided the manner in which they are protesting is
peaceful and within the law.
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
seized the northern third of the island following a short-lived coup.
