Detroit Band Sponge
Vinnie Dombrowski, lead singer of the blue-collar Detroit rock outfit
Sponge, was astounded when Howard Stern played a track from the band's
debut album on his syndicated radio show a few weeks ago.
As a result, sales of Sponge's ``Rotting Pinata'' (Chaos/Columbia) shot
up in cities where the Stern show is broadcast. Dombrowski, still
incredulous several weeks later, pointed to album sales in New York and
Los Angeles, in particular, as receiving an unexpected boost from
Stern.
``We had no idea he was going to play it,'' the singer said. ``What
happened was, one of Howard's interns came into the studio and said,
`Here, try this. You might dig it.' Stern let the track play almost to
the end.''
The track, titled ``Plowed,'' is also getting airplay elsewhere. At
local album-rocker KLOS-FM (95.5), the hard-driving number is on light
rotation, said music director Rita Wilde.
``It's new and different and sounds just great on radio,'' she said.
``It's an exciting song.''
Dombrowski -- who normally uses just his first name -- said ``Plowed''
is about ``being crushed by the events in this modern world and at the
same time trying coherently to live some kind of sane life.''
Vinnie added that he doesn't go looking for subjects for his songs.
Instead, the lyricist said, ``it's just how the world affects me. I
want to touch people on an emotional level, the same way I'm touched. I
try and stay away from that `met you in a bar' kind of thing.''
The five members of Sponge -- who appear at the Troubadour in West
Hollywood on Monday -- come from the same neighborhood and have kicked
around Detroit for years, during a time when the city's once-vital
music scene evaporated along with a high number of jobs. In the '60s
and '70s, the Motor City spawned the Motown label, plus hard rockers
like Ted Nugent, Iggy Pop and the MC5.
``There's a real lack of opportunity there,'' Vinnie, 31, said.
``Because of that, people turn to music for sustenance.
Extensive touring in the Midwest led to Sponge getting its demo tape to
Chaos/Columbia executives.
``Without this combination of personalities, the band wouldn't work as
well,'' Vinnie said. ``There's a common effort. Everybody brings
something different to the table.''
Meanwhile, the road beckons as Sponge continues to hone its live act in
clubs throughout the country.
``We just want to deliver the tunes,'' Vinnie said. ``There really
isn't much else to do on the road.''
