China-formed Hong Kong shadow parliament to meet in Shenzhen 
China's shadow parliament for Hong Kong, widely opposed by Britain and
the pro-democracy camp, is to start its plenary session in the Chinese
city of Shenzhen on Saturday, its legislator said Friday.
The provisional legislature is to set up two working groups to
determine working rules and study an administrative framework, its
president Rita Fan said.
The two working groups, comprising of 12 members each, one on
administrative matters and the other on rules of procedure, will then
meet concurrently to elect convenors and formulate future work plans,
she said.
Team convenors will then move resolutions to the interim body for
endorsement.
The body has agreed to meet in Shenzhen, China's most prosperous
special economic zone, just across the border with the territory in the
run-up to the handover to China on July 1, to avoid "misunderstanding
and rows," Fan said.
The 60-member provisional legislature, comprising pro-Beijing
politicians and businessmen, will replace the elected Legislative
Council (LegCo) set up by Britain's outgoing colonial government.
Britain, backed by democrats in Hong Kong, has clashed with China over
Beijing's plans to scrap the current elected legislature.
The row began after Governor Chris Patten introducted voting reforms,
which culminated last year in the colony's first-ever democratic
elections.
