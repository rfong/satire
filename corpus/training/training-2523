Palestinian dead, three Israeli soldiers injured in Gaza blast 
A Palestinian killed himself and lightly wounded three Israeli soldiers
Sunday when his donkey-cart packed with explosives blew up near a
military base in the self-rule Gaza Strip, the Israeli army said.
The soldiers were driving nearby in a jeep when the cart exploded at a
crossroads close to the Jewish settlement of Neve Dekalim, an army
spokesman said.
A military official said earlier there were no casualties.
The blast came only a few hours before a meeting between Israeli
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO leader Yasser Arafat in Gaza, to
discuss a deal on extending Palestinian self-rule.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Palestinian sources
did not rule out that it was a revenge attack for the killing of
Islamic Jihad leader Mahmud el-Khawaja, gunned down Thursday in the
Gaza Strip by masked men.
Both Islamic Jihad and the larger Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS
have sworn to avenge Khawaja's death which they blamed on the Israeli
secret services.
An inquiry has been launched to find out how the donkey-cart managed to
get so close to an Israeli military base despite security measures. The
animal was also killed in the explosion.
