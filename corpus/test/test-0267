South Korea's Hyundai to set up car factory in southern India 
South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. plans to invest more than
one billion dollars in a passenger car factory in the southern Indian
state of Tamil Nadu, a newspaper reported Thursday.
Production of Hyundai's "Accent" model will begin at the plant in 1998,
the newspaper said, adding that the South Korean company would use
Tamil Nadu as an export base.
The South Korean firm would also use the coastal state to manufacture
spares for its 1,300cc and 1,500cc models for India, the newspaper
said.
Ford Motor Co. of the United States has already set up a base in Tamil
Nadu through a 228-million-dollar joint venture with an Indian firm to
manufacture its Fiesta and Escort model cars.
The opening of India's automobile market four years ago has attracted a
number of global automakers such as Mercedes-Benz AG, General Motors
Corp., Volkswagen AG, Rover, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and PSA
Peugeot-Citroen.
Maruti Udyog Ltd., in which the Indian government and Japan's Suzuki
Motor Corp. are equal partners, plans to jack up annual production from
270,000 vehicles to 450,000 units by 1998 to retain its 65-percent
share of the domestic market.
None of Maruti's rivals has so far come up with a small car to match
its mainstay 800cc model.
