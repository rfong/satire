Japanese railway robbing its own customers 
For those Japanese who say the cost of rail travel is daylight robbery,
there's a new twist -- a railway company is offering a trip in which it
stages a holdup of its own customers.
The fake robbery is part of the fun in a special trip by the famous
bullet train, a so-called Theatre Express running 400 kilometers (250
miles) between Tokyo and Morioka, the Japan Times reported Wednesday.
Two hours after the train starts its run, 35 actors toting fake pistols
burst into the carriages, seizing belongings and taking hostages, it
said.
The "victims" are taken to a Morioka hotel, where they are cossetted
with hot mineral-water baths and spend the night before returning to
Tokyo.
More than 600 people, 80 percent of them young women, signed up for the
first trip last Saturday at 400 dollars a head.
