Official of Malaysia's ruling party fined for drug offence 
An official of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's ruling
United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) was Monday fined 1,500
ringgit (600 dollars) for a drug offence.
Abdul Hamid Mohammad (Eds. correct), the vice-chairman of the Sungai
Petani UMNO division in northern Kedah state, pleaded guilty in a local
court to possessing four grams (0.13 ounces) of cannabis in October
this year.
He was fined 1,500 ringgit in default nine months' jail by magistrate
Amarjeet Singh, Bernama news agency reported. Abdul Hamid paid the
fine.
Under Malaysia's tough drug laws, anyone caught with 15 grams (0.52
ounces) of heroin or 200 grams (7.05 ounces) of cannabis faces a
mandatory death sentence if convicted.
More than 100 people, a third of them foreigners, have been hanged for
drug offences in Malaysia since the law was introduced in 1981.
