Remembering The Original Dream Team
With the USA's "Dream Team" looking to redeem their poor 2004
performance, we look back on the first, and arguably the
best, Dream Team:
In the 1988 Olympic games, U.S. amateur basketball players are only
able to achieve a bronze medal, prompting FIBA officials to make sure
that never happens again
Coach Chuck Daly wakes up one morning in 1991 and writes down a dream
he had in which a team of all the NBA's best players easily defeated
everyone in the world while wearing their pajamas; Daly later removed
the part about the pajamas
During team USA's 116-48 whooping of Angola, Christian Laettner waits
in the locker room to avoid getting in the way of the awesome players
The Dream Team plays the game against Lithuania in slow motion, dunking
the ball 100 times
After a no-look-behind-the-back-pass from Larry Bird, Jordan dishes the
ball to Magic Johnson, who throws it to Charles Barkley, who bounces it
to Patrick Ewing, who sends it to Chris Mullin, who tosses it to Clyde
Drexler, who throws it to David Robinson, who hurls it to Karl Malone,
who slings it to John Stockton, who heaves it down the court to Scottie
Pippen, who is stopped by the referees whistling the play dead because
the Dream Team has 11 men on the court
Clyde Drexler plays an entire game without touching the ground once
Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan use their time together during fast
breaks to learn that they both love gambling
Michael Jordan leads the way against Croatia with 22 points, finally
settling the dispute over who is better, Michael Jordan or Croatia
A tearful Karl Malone clutches his gold medal and insists the feeling
is better than winning an NBA championship as his fellow Dream Teamers
hide their grins and nod supportively
