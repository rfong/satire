Clinton/NNP `/`` Disappointed/NNP '/'' President/NNP Clinton/NNP said/VBD Friday/NNP he/PRP was/VBD ``/`` disappointed/JJ ''/'' by/IN Panama/NNP 's/POS refusal/NN to/TO accept/VB Haitian/JJ refugees/NNS but/CC that/IN his/PRP$ administration/NN is/VBZ searching/VBG for/IN other/JJ temporary/JJ homes/NNS for/IN the/DT fleeing/JJ islanders/NNS ./.

Clinton/NNP seemed/VBD frustrated/JJ ,/, but/CC he/PRP refused/VBD to/TO analyze/VB Thursday/NNP 's/POS move/NN by/IN Panama/NNP President/NNP Guillermo/NNP Endara/NNP to/TO back/VB out/RP on/IN a/DT deal/NN to/TO accept/VB thousands/NNS of/IN Haitian/JJ refugees/NNS ,/, who/WP were/VBD to/TO be/VB housed/VBN on/IN former/JJ U.S./NNP military/JJ bases/NNS ./.

Panama/NNP 's/POS withdrawal/NN from/IN the/DT plan/NN leaves/VBZ only/RB three/CD small/JJ Caribbean/JJ islands/NNS --/: Grenada/NNP ,/, Antigua/NNP and/CC Dominica/NNP --/: as/RB publicly/RB ready/JJ to/TO accept/VB fleeing/VBG Haitians/NNS ./.

The/DT situation/NN leaves/VBZ U.S./NNP ships/NNS with/IN no/DT place/NN to/TO take/VB the/DT more/JJR than/IN 10,000/CD refugees/NNS who/WP have/VBP been/VBN picked/VBN up/RP at/IN sea/NN since/IN Monday/NNP ./.

Coast/NNP Guard/NNP cutters/NNP and/CC Navy/NNP warships/NNS are/VBP so/RB overloaded/JJ with/IN boat/NN people/NNS that/IN ,/, in/IN some/DT cases/NNS ,/, they/PRP can/MD not/RB pick/VB up/RP any/DT more/JJR Haitians/NN ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT U.S./NNP Embassy/NNP in/IN the/DT Haitian/JJ capital/NN of/IN Port-au-Prince/NNP ./.

The/DT Pentagon/NNP said/VBD 1,859/CD more/JJR boat/NN people/NNS were/VBD picked/VBN up/RP Friday/NNP ./.

But/CC 407/CD asked/VBD to/TO be/VB sent/VBN home/RB when/WRB told/VBD they/PRP could/MD not/RB seek/VB U.S./NNP asylum/NN by/IN leaving/VBG Haiti/NNP ./.

``/`` My/PRP$ concern/NN right/RB now/RB is/VBZ to/TO build/VB a/DT network/NN of/IN friends/NNS in/IN the/DT hemisphere/NN who/WP agree/VBP that/IN the/DT Haitians/NNPS are/VBP entitled/VBN to/TO consideration/NN .../: and/CC who/WP want/VBP to/TO help/VB us/PRP to/TO do/VB it/PRP ,/, ''/'' Clinton/NNP said/VBD at/IN a/DT news/NN conference/NN before/IN the/DT opening/NN of/IN the/DT annual/JJ economic/JJ summit/NN here/RB ./.

About/RB the/DT only/JJ sanctuary/NN that/IN Clinton/NNP seemed/VBD to/TO rule/VB out/RP was/VBD the/DT Haitians/NNPS '/POS apparent/JJ favorite/NN --/: southern/JJ Florida/NNP ,/, where/WRB the/DT prospect/NN of/IN additional/JJ Caribbean/JJ refugees/NNS is/VBZ a/DT volatile/JJ political/JJ issue/NN ./.

Although/IN Clinton/NNP refused/VBD to/TO dissect/VB the/DT Panamanian/JJ action/NN ,/, White/NNP House/NNP press/NN secretary/NN Dee/NNP Dee/NNP Myers/NNP said/VBD :/: ``/`` They/PRP changed/VBD their/PRP$ minds/NNS ./. ''/''

``/`` Obviously/RB ,/, the/DT situation/NN in/IN Panama/NNP did/VBD not/RB work/VB out/RP as/IN we/PRP hoped/VBD ,/, ''/'' Myers/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` We/PRP had/VBD an/DT agreement/NN with/IN them/PRP ./. ''/''

Clinton/NNP fought/VBD off/RP several/JJ attempts/NNS by/IN reporters/NNS to/TO pin/VB him/PRP down/RB on/IN how/WRB likely/JJ he/PRP is/VBZ to/TO order/VB U.S./NNP military/JJ intervention/NN to/TO force/VB out/RP Haiti/NNP 's/POS rulers/NNS ,/, who/WP took/VBD power/NN in/IN a/DT coup/NN three/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, and/CC restore/VB elected/JJ President/NNP Jean-Bertrand/NNP Aristide/NNP ./.

Clinton/NNP repeated/VBD that/IN he/PRP would/MD not/RB rule/VB out/RP any/DT options/NNS ,/, including/VBG use/NN of/IN military/JJ force/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT final/JJ answer/NN of/IN his/PRP$ 30-minute/JJ news/NN conference/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD :/: ``/`` I/PRP think/VBP the/DT conduct/NN of/IN the/DT military/JJ leaders/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- in/IN Haiti/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- will/MD have/VB more/JJR than/IN anything/NN else/RB to/TO do/VB with/IN what/WP options/NNS are/VBP considered/VBN when/WRB ./.

Mfume/NNP said/VBD air/NN strikes/NNS against/IN military/JJ targets/NNS in/IN Haiti/NNP should/MD be/VB considered/VBN ,/, but/CC he/PRP was/VBD concerned/VBN that/IN ``/`` it/PRP not/RB be/VB handled/VBN as/IN sloppily/NN as/IN we/PRP have/VBP handled/VBN the/DT refugee/NN problem/NN ./. ''/''

Clinton/NNP did/VBD not/RB talk/VB about/IN Haiti/NNP in/IN the/DT opening/VBG statement/NN at/IN his/PRP$ news/NN conference/NN on/IN the/DT Naples/NNP waterfront/NN ,/, but/CC questions/NNS about/IN the/DT troubled/JJ nation/NN dominated/VBD his/PRP$ meeting/NN with/IN reporters/NNS ./.

Haitians/NNS can/MD currently/RB apply/VB for/IN U.S./NNP asylum/NN by/IN going/VBG to/TO a/DT consular/NN center/NN in/IN Haiti/NNP ,/, and/CC Clinton/NNP said/VBD the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS has/VBZ stepped/VBN up/RP that/DT effort/NN ./.
