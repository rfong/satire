Liquefied Cocaine Seized at Athens Airport 
Greek police at the Athens airport confiscated 19.5 kilograms of
liquefied cocaine later Thursday when they arrested an Italian man who
smuggled the drugs in vases bearing the indication "compote."
Police said that the 43-year-old Egido Gennero bought the cocaine in
Lima, Peru. He flew to Athens by a Swissair flight from Zurich.
It is the second similar case within the week. Police arrested a Greek
man at the airport for possession of liquefied cocaine on Tuesday.
