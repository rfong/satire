Eight farm-animal thieves condemned to death 
Eight Chinese accused of being part of a farm-animal theft ring were
condemned to death in the northwest province of Heilonjiang, a
provincial newspaper reported.
The Heilonjiang daily, received here Friday, said the provincial
supreme court convicted the accused of having stolen several hundred
cows, horses and mules as well as farm vehicles over more than three
years.
The total value of the booty was estimated at 459,000 yuan (55,000
dollars).
The daily didn't specify if the condemned were executed immediately
after the verdict, as is often the case.
The death sentences are part of a national anti-crime campaign launched
in April, which according to Chinese press reports has already led to
the execution of more than 500 people.
