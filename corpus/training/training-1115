U.N. Mission Probes Small Arms Proliferation in Kenya 
A United Nations fact- finding mission has begun work in Kenya to
determine the scale of the proliferation of small arms in the African
country, a U.N. spokeswoman said here Monday.
The mission is an initial effort to respond to a request from the
Government of Kenya for U.N. assistance in dealing with the scourge of
small arms, she said.
The team, which arrived in Nairobi, capital of Kenya, on Monday and
will be there through Friday, is led by Joo Honwana, chief of the U.N.
Conventional Arms Branch.
The group, which includes staff from the U.N. Department of Political
Affairs and the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), will meet with
officials from the Kenyan Government and nongovernmental organizations,
as well as representatives of other countries in the region and the
local diplomatic community, she added.
