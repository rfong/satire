Italy prods Israel on Mideast negotiations 
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini urged Israel Wednesday to take a
bold initiative in relaunching Middle East peace talks given the
moderate stance adopted by the Arab world during its recent summit in
Cairo.
Dini, at the end of a meeting here, said he was confident that "after
the election statements, the peace process will move forward with all
concerned parties."
He said he expected the new Israeli government to bow to reality and
take into account, through bold unilateral action, the wishes of all
those who want the dialogue to continue.
Dini stressed that Arab countries had, at the end of last week's Cairo
summit, all reaffirmed their commitment to the peace process without
hesitation or exception.
However, he said their undertaking included "a warning to Israel," with
Arab countries threatening to revoke their policy of opening towards
the Jewish state if the new Israeli government changes the basic terms
of the negotiations. That means, Dini added, questioning the principle
of land for peace.
He said the attitude of Arab countries showed that moderate elements
continue to prevail, and that at the most, they are inhibiting the
influence of radicals.
Dini, who is acting president of the EU council of foreign ministers,
said the Florence summit declaration on the Middle East, issued
Saturday, helped to set a moderate and constructive tone for the Arab
summit.
The European gathering encouraged all parties to continue the peace
process and negotiate on all questions put foward, including Jerusalem.
Dini recalled that the key principles of peace were self-determination
for the Palestinians with all that implies, and an exchange of land for
peace.
