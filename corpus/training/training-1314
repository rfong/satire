Polish shipyard workers halt trains 
Two thousand workers from the bankrupt Gdansk shipyards blocked road
and rail traffic in this Baltic port for four hours on Thursday to
protest government plans to lay them off.
Police stood by as the workers took over the railway station and set
fire to tyres on the tracks, sending a thick plume of black oil smoke
over the city centre and blocking the passage of 30 trains.
Vowing to return Friday to continue their action, the protestors filed
out of the station to resume their posts.
Wednesday, 1,500 workers had stopped traffic in the city for an hour in
a campaign they promised to continue until the government restored
their jobs.
"This is only the beginning, we will come back every day until we get
results," a union official, Karol Guzikiewicz, said on Wednesday.
"We don't care whether the shipyards are Polish or foreign-owned or
whether they are called Gdansk or something else," he said. "The
important thing is that they remain in existence and that people keep
their jobs."
The Gdansk shipyards, birthplace of the Solidarity movement that ended
communist rule in Poland, announced last Thursday the layoff of all
3,700 workers.
The shipyards -- declared bankrupt last August when debts were put
around 154 million dollars -- have been unable to find a creditor bank
willing to bail out the facility, the administrators said.
Solidarity leaders are to decide a strategy for a national campaign
next Monday.
