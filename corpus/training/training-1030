Northeast China's State-Owned Enterprise Reform Progressing Smoothly 
The industrial output value for the state-owned firms in northeastern
Liaoning Province reached 38 billion yuan (4.6 billion U.S. dollars)
for the first quarter this year, a rise of 10.6 percent over the same
period last year, latest statistics show.
The provincial government has always persevered on taking varied reform
measures in line with the actual conditions of the state-owned
enterprises in petrochemicals, non-ferrous metals, the military, coal,
textiles, and metallurgical industries.
The economic performance for all local state-owned enterprises have
been advancing, with losses reduced by 244 million yuan in the first
quarter.
The provincial government this year has focused it attention on 61
large state-owned enterprises whose total assets, sales volume, and
added value exceeds 70 percent of the province's total nationalized
industry. The government also has been attempting to upgrade the
technical level, expand the domestic market, and improve the managerial
quality of these enterprises.
