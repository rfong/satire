Northern Ireland Tourist Attraction Gets A Makeover
The Northern Ireland Tourist Board has unveiled its latest initiative
to bring tourists back to Antrim's north coast.
Barney Haig, NI Culture Secretary, told The Spoof:
"In a new initiative we have decided to spruce up one or two of the
Province's attractions, starting with the Giants Causeway. We are
spending the winter colour-coding the stones and hope visitors will
agree that it's an improvement for the better"
And Aron Rodd, Minister for Tourism, added:
"Oh aye! Indeed aye yes. That's stickin'out so it is...And if you ask
me like, then it's quare stuff an'all. Yah cudn't bate it with a big
stick so yah cudn't and it'll put Nor'n Ir'n back on the tourist map so
it will"
Samuel Johnson quipped:
"Ah yes, the Giants Causeway...worth seeing but not worth going to see"
The jumped up pompous pratt.
Whilst Oscar Wilde commented:
"Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's
opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation"
Whatever the hell that had to do with it. But surely the last word has
to go to Captain James T Kirk, as he viewed the causeway through the
Hubble bubble toil and trouble telescope.
"Fascinating... what does the tri-corder say Bones?
