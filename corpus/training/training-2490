APEC Economic Leaders' Declaration: From Vision To Action
1. We the Economic Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, met today in Subic, the Philippines, for our fourth annual
meeting. Our collective achievements of sustained economic growth,
increased employment, and regional stability are the result of our
shared commitment to growth-oriented policies, the broadest
participation in the regional and global economy, and an environment of
stability and security. We came to Subic to strengthen this commitment
and to reaffirm that the ultimate objective of our individual and
collective endeavors is to enrich the lives and to improve the
standards of living of all out citizens on a sustainable basis.
2. At Blake Island three years ago, we committed ourselves to
"deepening our spirit of community based on our shared vision of
achieving stability, security and prosperity for our people." In Bogor
a year after, we began the process of realizing this vision by
committing ourselves to the goals of free and open trade and investment
in the region. Last year in Osaka, we agreed on the framework of our
future work to reach our common goals built through trade and
investment liberalization, trade and investment facilitation and
economic and technical cooperation.
3. Today in Subic, we have deepened the spirit of community in the
Asia-Pacific region and have affirmed our commitment to sustainable
growth and equitable development.
4. We have:
- launched the implementation phase of our free and open trade and
investment agenda,
- delivered business facilitation measures,
- agreed to advance common goals in the World Trade Organization,
- developed ways to strengthen economic and technical cooperation, and
- engaged the business sector as a full partner in the APEC process.
