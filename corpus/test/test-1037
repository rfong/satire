Sprint Announces Completion of Deal with European Telecoms 
Sprint Corp. on Thursday announced the signing of a dlrs 4.1 billion
joint venture agreement with Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom to
provide telecommunications services around the world.
The European telecoms will purchase 20 percent of Sprint, including
86.2 million shares of newly issued Sprint stock.
The European telecoms will get a toehold in the United States, the
largest phone market in the world, and will be better equipped to
compete with private companies if their markets are eventually
deregulated.
``The agreement we've signed today with Deutsche Telekom and France
Telecom mark an important milestone,'' William Esrey, Sprint chairman
and chief executive, said in a New York teleconference with reporters
and analysts.
``It's going to provide customers around the world with a broad array
of telecommunications services with the most advanced technology.''
The deal is still under review by the U.S. Department of Justice and
the Federal Communications Commission. It also requires approval from
the European Commission, the board of France Telecom and Sprint
shareholders.
But the companies were optimistic that the venture would go through.
They expect the deal to close in late 1995.
The three companies had been negotiating the deal since June 1994, when
the Europeans announced they would pay dlrs 4.2 billion for part
ownership of Sprint. The value of Thursday's deal could rise to dlrs
4.2 billion depending on the performance of Sprint's stock around the
time the deal closes.
Sprint shares were trading up 50 cents at dlrs 35.125 on the New York
Stock Exchange this morning.
Sprint last week said it was considering spinning off its cellular
division, Sprint Cellular. If that occurs, the Europeans would pay a
reduced price of around dlrs 3.5 billion for their 20 percent stake in
the remainder of Sprint, and would have no share in the spinoff.
A special board will run the joint venture. The operating group serving
Europe, except for France and Germany, will be owned one-third by
Sprint and two-thirds by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom.
Outside the United States and Europe, the venture will be half-owned by
Sprint and half-owned by the Europeans.
The venture will not operate in the United States, France or Germany.
The principals will continue doing their own business in their home
countries.
Sprint may use some of the money to lower its debt, Esrey said. It also
has ``an embarrassment of opportunities'' for new projects, he said.
Sprint needs to build a service network for a new generation of
wireless phone licenses.
