Kick Boxer Swallows Testes
Thai kick boxing champion Mi Luvyu Longtime suffered a serious injury
in a bout yesterday while he was facing a challenger.
The sports governing body said it was unfortunate for the fighter but
added that "the boxers put their balls on the line" every time they
step into the ring.
Swallowing of testicles is a common occurrence in the world of Thai
fighting but it was unusual for a fighter to swallow another guy's
testicles.
"In Bangkok it can happen," said an enthusiastic fan. "One thing leads
to another. The lady boys around here can be very realistic and it's
often hard to tell the difference until it's too late."
It appears the boxer became entangled with his competitor during a
particularly violent struggle and had his genitals gulped down like two
hard-boiled eggs.
The boxer has been released from hospital with a set of artificial
replacements. The other fighter has wished to remain anonymous for
fears of reprisals.
