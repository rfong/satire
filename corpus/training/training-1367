Shrooms Ground Flyin' Air
Airlines have been brought down to earth by everything fro bad weather
to mechanical malfunctions but a recent grounding of a Flyin' Air
flight may have been a first for any airline in the world.
Flying from Budapest to Dublin, the flight required diversion to
Frankfurt after a passenger went into an allergic shock due to exposure
to mushrooms. At first the airline officials suspected funny fungi of
the hallucinagenic variety and arrested 80 year old Babushka O'Brien ,
an Hungarian- Irish grandmother who regularly flies back and forth from
Ireland to Hungary to visit her many grandkids.
"At first we thought that the old lady was a drug mule. She takes
monthly flights from the Emerald Isle to Goulashland. Then she turns
out to be the source of the mushies that sends one of our passengers
off the wall like a Tim Leary test subject...What would you think?
Then after testing the substance and the allergic jerk who panicked
when a little mushroom and barley soup leaked on his head from the
overhead compartment, we knew that she was really just a little old
grandma bringing homemade soup to her grands!
