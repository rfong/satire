Humanitarian Situation in Serbia Critical, Says Red Cross 
The Yugoslav Red Cross and other state institutions has warned that
humanitarian supplies have long been exhausted and that about 700,000
refugees in Serbia are in the most difficult predicament in the past
two years.
According to figures provided by the Yugoslav Red Cross, Serbia has
450,719 refugees from the period 1991-1995 and 286,959 exiles from the
Republic of Serb Krajina who arrived in August 1995.
The Red Cross said today its warehouses were practically emptied six
months ago, but international humanitarian organizations did not
evaluate and assess the situation in this aspect until now so as to ask
for new funds for their work in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
according to Tanjug news agency.
The Red Cross said international humanitarian aid have sent in about
18,000 tons of food, 54 percent of which were flour, since August 1995.
When this amount of aid is placed in proportion with the number of
refugees, one person only gets 17.5 kg of humanitarian aid each month,
which comprises one litre of table oil, one kg of sugar, two cans of
corned beef, three cans of sardines, and 10-15 kg of flour, the Red
Cross said.
It went on to say that the main reason for this disproportion in needs
lies in the number of refugees and displaced persons registered by
international humanitarian organizations.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the humanitarian office of the
European Union, and the World Food Program have on their lists 160,000
refugees and 175,000 displaced persons, while the Yugoslav Red Cross
has counted 185,294 refugees and 289,438 among displaced persons in
Serbia.
Moreover, about 50,000 persons from the Bosnian Serb Republic should be
added to this list, the Red Cross said, as they also take aid from the
Red Cross although they have no refugee status.
It also pointed out that even though a peace deal has been struck in
Bosnia, both the Yugoslav authorities and representatives of
international humanitarian organizations estimate that the repatriation
of refugees from Yugoslavia will be a slower process than it seems to
be, and therefore more and urgent humanitarian aid is needed from the
international community.
