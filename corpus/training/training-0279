Chancellor Hints German Military Contribution to U.S. Retaliation
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Sunday said that Germany would
possibly contribute military means to the United States' possible
retaliation against terrorism.
Speaking on ZDF (television), Schroeder said that after the devastating
attacks in New York and Washington, he expressed " unlimited
solidarity" with Americans and that he wanted to have those words
followed with deeds, referring to a possible input of German military
personnel.
"At all events I can not and will not rule out that," he said.
He also cautioned that the Bush administration should refrain from
retaliating hastily to terrorist attacks and urged that besides
punishing those responsible, it was also necessary to adopt a
"world-wide political concept of fighting terror."
