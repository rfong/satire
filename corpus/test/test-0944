Gustaffson makes sure a Swede reaches final
Magnus Gustafsson made sure a Swedish player will compete in Sunday's final
at the 2.5 million dollar Paris Indoor Open here when he defeated
big-serving Marc Rosset 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 in a 'stop-start' quarter-final which
stretched over two hours.
The 29-year-old from Lund will now play either 12th seed Thomas Enqvist
or former world number-one Stefan Edberg in the semi-finals.
Gustafsson's showdown against the big-serving, 6ft 7in (2m01)
man-mountain from Switzerland never really lived up to its potential
because of a series of interruptions and protests over the electronic
net cord device.
Eventually supervisor Mark Darby and umpire Richard Kaufman intervened
at the end of the second set and turned down the sensitivity of the
machine.
Later both players made it clear they preferred the old-fashioned net
cord judges.
"I think there's a better way to spend so much money than for a machine
that doesn't work," he said, adding: "I think it would be better to
play as we did in the past with the men at the net."
An ATP spokesman later confirmed that the sensitivity of the net device
had been adjusted at the changeover and that after that it had given no
more problems.
The device apart, Rosset, a finalist here in 1994, was far too erratic
to upset the steady Swede -- often sending double-fisted backhands
streaming into space.
And although the Swiss player fired down 17 aces and hit one effort at
a tournament record speed of 212 kms per hour, Gutafsson claimed that
Rosset's bullets suited him.
"His big-serving style seems to suit my game," he said.
It was Gustafsson's fourth victory in five meetings against the
Barcelona Olympic champion.
But the 29-year-old Swede, winner of two titles this year (at St
Petersburg and Bastad), admitted that there was a cloud over his
future.
After a week in which he has beaten Andre Agassi and played some of the
best tennis of his career, Gustafsson knows that he may have to undergo
a shoulder operation after next week's ATP event in Stockholm.
"The injury is up and down. One day it's good and the next day it's
pretty bad. I shall have an x-ray after Stockholm. At the moment I am
taking anti-inflamation pills and I have been doing a lot of swimming
and physical work in the hope that I won't need an operation.
"But if I do, the doctor says I shall be out for five or six weeks. It
will be a shame to stop when I'm playing like this.
Referring to Sweden's Davis Cup team for the final against France
starting on November 29, Gustafsson, said: "I hadn't even thought about
being selected. But now, playing like this, I think I have a little
chance.
"Thomas Enqvist and Stefan Edberg are both playing very good tennis at
the moment but maybe I shall be selected anyway. There are five in the
team."
Apart from the Edberg versus Enqvist clash, the day's other scheduled
quarter-finals were between Arnaud Boetsch of France and Petr Korda of
the Czech Republic, and fourth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Paul
Haarhuis of the Netherlands.
