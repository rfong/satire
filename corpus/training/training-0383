Policeman killed, more suspects to go on trial for Mahfouz stabbing 
Suspected Islamic militants shot dead a policeman as he returned home
from work Sunday in the troubled Minya province of southern Egypt,
police said.
Court sources, meanwhile, said another 16 suspects were to go on trial
for the stabbing in October of Nobel literature laureate Naguib
Mahfouz, after two death sentences were passed last week.
The policeman was killed near his home in a village near the hotspot of
Mallawi, police said. The gunmen, believed to be members of the
outlawed Jamaa Islamiyya, escaped.
Almost 600 people have been killed since Islamic militants declared war
on the government of President Hosni Mubarak in March 1992.
Among the new suspects in the Mahfouz case, due to reopen soon, is
Yasser Abdel Maabud, who is accused of delivering the final plan for
the attack on the author, court sources said.
They said Abdel Maabud and several more suspects had been extradited
after taking refuge in other Arab countries. He fled to Saudi Arabia
but was sent back in late October.
The 16 are accused of belonging to Jamaa, whose aim is to overthrow the
government by force, and of helping to hide the Mahfouz assailants.
Last Tuesday, a military court sentenced two militants to death and
jailed 11 others for the October 14 attack in which Mahfouz was stabbed
in the neck. The 83-year-old author spent 50 days in hospital.
