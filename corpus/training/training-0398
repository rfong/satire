Ferrasse says sack Berbizier and stay amateur 
Albert Ferrasse, French rugby federation president from 1968 to 1991
and vice-president for the last four years, has called for coach Pierre
Berbizier to be sacked and for French rugby to stay amateur.
"He didn't do much as a player at Lourdes or at Agen and as coach of
France all he has had is one or two big wins, the sort we have always
had in the last 50 years," said the 76-year-old who steps down from the
Federation this weekend.
"In any case he's too gloomy to lead a team," added Ferrasse who called
on federation president Bernard Lapasset to discipline Berbizier in
March when the coach turned him out of the dressing room at the Parc
des Princes.
Ferrasse will continue as president of the International Amateur Rugby
Federation (FIRA), which the French set up in 1931 when they were
thrown out of the five nations championship over allegations of
professionalism.
"And we'll stay amateur," he said.
He said French clubs could not afford to go professional and applauded
Lapasset's decision to reject all-out professionalism.
However, the FFR's legal committee will have to find a loophole in a
new law which could force rugby clubs to register as companies. The
legislation affects any sports club making payments of any kind
amounting to 2.5 million francs a year -- a sum every French first
division club surpasses.
As a registered company they would be unable to benefit from tax
concessions and local authorities, who have already been ordered to end
grants by 1998, would be unable to offer them free use of
municipality-owned grounds.
The move could hurt sponsorship. Companies might be unable to set aside
sponsorship against tax liabilities, as rugby's current status as an
amateur sport allows them.
The situation is made more complicated by the fact that players who had
been declaring payments as expenses were ordered to make social
security contributions on earnings last year.
