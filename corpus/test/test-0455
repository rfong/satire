Taiwan's Claims for Independence Refuted (1) 
Historically, the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation both
completely refute the allegation by Taiwan authorities that they are a
separate and independent state.
To the contrary they serve to confirm as undeniable proof that the rest
of the world accepts that Taiwan is a part of the People's Republic of
China (PRC), according to Lu Yue, a Chinese scholar specializing in
Taiwan studies.
He accused the Taiwan authorities of attempting to use the documents to
suit their own purpose because they have called themselves the
'Republic of China' (ROC).
The Cairo Declaration, signed by China, the United States and Britain
in November 1943, and approved by the former Soviet Union, prescribed
that the Chinese territory seized or occupied by Japan, which included
Manchuria, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, should be returned to the
"Republic of China."
The Potsdam Proclamation also confirmed that particular status quo, Lu
said in a recent article, pointing out that the two documents both
denied the independence claims made by the Manchurian and Nanking
'puppet' regimes during the War of Resistance Against Japan
(1937-1945).
The Manchurian and Nanking puppet regimes had never been recognized by
any of the countries fighting fascism, Lu said, and the two regimes
were finally dismantled in 1945 when China defeated Japanese invaders.
Lu also detailed the four necessary components that constitute a state
recognized by international law: residents, territory, a government and
sovereignty.
The 'Republic of China' in the Cairo Declaration refers to the
Chungking Nationalist government as the sole legitimate government
representing China at that time, the article noted.
