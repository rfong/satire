USA Waste Services agreed to buy Chambers Development Co. on Monday for
about $675 million in stock, in another sign of the growing
consolidation of the trash-disposal industry.
With this purchase, USA Waste, based in Dallas, will have merged and
acquired its way in four years to $450 million in annual sales from
$3.7 million.
Meanwhile, Browning-Ferris Industries, another major contestant in the
acquisitions race, has been pursuing Attwoods PLC of Britain with a
recently raised bid of $615 million that Attwoods has rejected.
Monday, Browning-Ferris said it would proceed with a takeover if it
received the support of just a majority of Attwoods' shareholders,
rather than the 90 percent that it had previously sought.
Tougher environmental rules and enforcement have helped to propel the
waste industry's consolidation by raising costs and putting a premium
on size and efficiency.
USA Waste's major acquisition this year has been Envirofil Inc. for
$165 million. The company also hired a new chief executive, John E.
Drury, an investment banker who had been president of Browning-Ferris
until 1991.
Drury said Chambers' landfills would complement his company's strength
in trash collection and hauling. ``Chambers has some of the finest
landfill assets in North America,'' he said in statement, ``and we
believe the combination of the two companies will provide significant
benefits to both shareholder groups.''
Asked at an analysts' conference just how far the industry's
consolidation has now gone, Drury said, ``We just think it's
beginning.''
Analysts agreed that the merger made strategic sense. But many
questioned whether USA Waste's offer might be too high. ``I think it's
a very, very generous offer,'' Andrew Silver, an analyst at Dillon
Read, said in an initial interview.
USA Waste's stated offer would have totaled about $5.83 a share, or
nearly $725 million, for Chambers, whose class A shares closed at
$4.125 Monday, up $1.125.
USA Waste's shares fell $1.50 to close at $12.50 Monday, reducing the
value of the offer to about $5.21 a share, or $675 million, including
the assumption of about $325 million in debt.
But USA Waste's stock rebounded from the day's low of $11.50 during the
late afternoon analysts' conference. Company executives made some
progress in persuading analysts that the combined company, which would
be the industry's fourth largest, could indeed earn more than the
separate entities, and that past Chambers losses would provide USA
Waste with substantial future tax benefits.
After the conference, Silver softened his criticism. ``It's a complex
deal and hard to tell on the face of it if that's the right price,' he
said.

Under the takeover agreement, USA Waste would trade about 42 shares for
each 100 shares of Chambers unless USA Waste's stock price changes
greatly.
Shareholders controlling a majority of Chambers' voting rights have
already committed themselves to the USA Waste merger.
Chambers is considerably larger than USA Waste, with 1993 sales of
$288.5 million; USA Waste's sales -- with recent acquisitions -- are
running at about $175 million.
The major handicap for Chambers has been an accounting scandal, which
in 1992 forced the company to wipe out $362 million of earnings
reported over several years back to the mid-1980s.
On Nov. 19, Chambers, based in Pittsburgh, said it had tentatively
agreed to settle the resulting shareholder lawsuits, leading to a
charge against earnings of $74 million.
A successful settlement as well as the conclusion of a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation remain conditions of the sale to USA
Waste. The companies expect the deal, which also requires federal
antitrust approval, to close in about six months.
USA Waste's operations are concentrated in the Southwest and Midwest,
while Chambers' covers the Atlantic seaboard from Maryland to the
Carolinas.
Drury would be chairman and chief executive of the combined company,
while John G. Rangos Sr., Chambers' chief executive, would become a USA
Waste vice chairman. The Rangos family, the principal shareholders in
Chambers, would be the largest owners of USA Waste, holding about 20
percent.
