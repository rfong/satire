Beijing Courts Emphasizes Enforcing Rulings 
The courts of Beijing will concentrate on enforcing rulings they've
made this year.
Zheng Gang, vice-president of Beijing's Higher People's Court, has said
that the court will set aside a special fund to see to it that the
ruling-enforcement campaign is carried out. By late March, more than
10,000 court rulings had not been carried out in Beijing, he said.
The Supreme People's Court launched a nationwide court-ruling
enforcement campaign last September to help carry out 900,000 court
rulings which were worth 100 billion yuan by the end of 1998.
Of these, 7,667 rulings made by Beijing's courts were enforced during
the September-December period.
