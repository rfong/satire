Klinsmann Set to Leave Bayern 
Soccer star Juergen Klinsmann announced on Tuesday he was going to
leave Bayern Munich at the end of the season, local reports said.
Klinsmann, 32, complained earlier in the season that he was unhappy
with Bayern's defensive tactics.
The Germany captain had also said that he was unsatisfied with the way
he had been treated when he was not in form.
His contract is due to end in June 1998 but the forward has an opt-out
clause which allows him to leave without a transfer fee.
