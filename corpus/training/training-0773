Securities Co-operation Between Mainland, Taiwan Encouraged 
Co-operation and exchanges between the securities industries of the
mainland and Taiwan will be further strengthened in the future, said
Liu Hongru, Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
Speaking at the ongoing Second Mainland-Taiwan Symposium on the
Securities and Futures Legal System here, Liu said that the exchanges
and cooperation on the security market will surely be enhanced,
although the cooperation has not yet taken on concrete forms at
present.
Dai Li Leung, a senior professor of Taiwan's Soochow University, said
that he is optimistic about the prospects for co-operation between the
two sides.
He noted that since the fund flow among the mainland, Taiwan and Hong
Kong has spread vastly in the past decade, it is necessary to
strengthen co-ordination in money management.
Talking about the issues of mainland firms being listed on Taiwan's
stock exchanges, Dai, who also held a position in Taiwan's securities
regulatory office, said that it is possible if conditions permit.
"The problem is just when and how," he explained.
According to Dai, some Taiwan investors who have set up ventures on the
mainland are keen to issue stocks on the mainland's stock exchanges,
because they need fund to expand their businesses.
