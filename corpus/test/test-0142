Syria, Jordan agree to curb cross-border infiltrations 
Syria and Jordan have reached an agreement to curb radical Palestinian
groups based in Syria from infiltrating across their common borders and
eventually into Israel, Asharq al-Awsat reported Monday.
The Saudi daily, quoting an unnamed Jordanian official, said Syria and
Jordan agreed "to consider the borders red lines in the face of groups
opposed to the (Middle East) peace process."
Ties between Syria and Jordan were strained after Jordan's King Hussein
accused Syria last month of sending anti-Israeli militants to
infiltrate Jordan and carry out attacks against Jordanian targets and
Israeli tourists.
Three Israeli soldiers were killed last month by Palestinian guerrillas
who infiltrated into the West Bank from Jordan.
Relations between the two neighbours had deteriorated after Jordan
signed a peace treaty with Israel in October 1994.
But last month Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak organised a meeting
between King Hussein and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on the
sidelines of an Arab summit in Cairo to patch up their relations.
According to Asharq al-Awsat, the agreement between Syria and Jordan
was reached during meetings last week between officials from both
countries at the border towns of Deraa and Ramtha.
They also agreed on measures to curb smuggling across their common
borders amid complaints from the Jordanian officials of drug smuggling
operations from the Syrian-controlled eastern Bekaa Valley of Lebanon
while Syrian officials cited the smuggling of petrol from the Jordanian
side.
