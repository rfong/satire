Indonesia reviews adoption of covenant on economic and civilian rights 
The National Human Rights Commission (Komnas Ham) has been reviewing
the possibility of Indonesia adopting the 1996 International Covenant
on Civilian and Political Rights, a commission member said here
Wednesday.
"They're difficult covenants, as many conditions need to be fulfilled,"
Komnas Ham member, Miriam Budiarjo, told AFP here Wednesday.
Once ratified, the covenant, already adopted by over 100 United Nation
members, would have to be integrated in the country's laws. The
covenant on civilian rights "includes the freedom of speech," Budiarjo
said.
Indonesia has been repeatedly criticised for violating freedom of
speech. Last year the government closed three popular magazines and
jailed numerous activists for alleged insults.
Budiarjo did not specify when the commission would conclude its review,
saying only that "it's going to take some time," and adding that it has
already recommended the government ratify other covenants against
cruelty and racial discrimination.
The covenant still need to be approved by parliament or the president
before it is fully adopted, Budiarjo said.
Komnas Ham, installed by President Suharto in December 1993, has been
praised by observers for its critical assessments of cases from land
disputes to human rights violations by the military, despite initial
skepticism by human rights activists here.
