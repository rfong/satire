Malaysia to Set Fund to Help Aged People
She said the YWT would look after the welfare of the senior citizens in
terms of their health care, housing, social facilities and recreation,
research development, education and training as well as advocacy.
"The population of the elderly group is expected to increase further
with improvement in health standards and longer life expectancy, thus
we need the foundation to take care of them," she told reporters at
Subang Jaya, near the capital.
Zaleha said the foundation would be launched in two or three months to
enable it to move and collect as well as to manage the funds donated by
corporate bodies and government agencies.
She hoped that the foundation will assist in implementing the Action
Plan for the Aged with solid support and financing from everyone.
She said the government had allocated 24.5 million ringgit (about 6.447
million U.S dollars) for various assistance including buying
spectacles, health care, and accommodation involving 42,574 aged people
in 1997.
By October 1998, a total of 22.4 million ringgit (about 5.894 million
dollars) had been also allocated for the benefit of 32,754 senior
citizens, she said.
