Blast at Buenos Aires Jewish organization levels seven-story building 
A powerful bomb exploded Monday at the headquarters of the Jewish
Mutual Association in Argentina, killing an undetermined number of
people and injuring many others, police said.
The seven-storey building in Buenos Aires' busy Once district collapsed
in the blast, and badly damaged adjacent premises.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the blast.
President Carlos Menem immediately dispatched legal and technical
minister Carlos Corach to the scene, where ambulances, fire trucks and
police units were crowded to attend to the emergency.
Stunned neighbors, many of them in bloodied bedclothes, managed to get
away from the scene on foot.
Police were trying to quiet the area, fearing many people may still be
trapped in the rubble, crying for help.
Ruben Beraja, the president of the Delegations of Jewish Associations
of Argentina, was at the scene with other Jewish group leaders. Beraja
said as many as 100 people may have been in the building at the time of
the morning blast.
A bomb attack on the Israeli embassy March 17, 1992 killed 30 people
and injured more than 200 others.
