NASA punches a new notch in its belt, thinks privatization
NASA will undergo another round of tough budget cuts that should
eliminate 55,000 jobs between payroll and related posts, with the space
agency thinking hard about privatizing in part.
President Bill Clinton announced Monday plans to restructure four
federal agencies including the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, cutting a total of some five thousand positions from
the government payroll to save more than 13 billion dollars over five
years.
And NASA administrator Daniel Goldin was set to announce later in the
day a series of spending cuts that would slash about 2,000 jobs from
agency payrolls as well as wipe out tens of thousands of related jobs
at contracting companies.
Goldin and Clinton were to detail the plan, part of the
administration's deficit-targetting "Reinventing Government" strategy,
led by Vice President Al Gore. In December, five other federal agencies
committed to slashing 20 billion budgeted dollars.
NASA has been paring its staff ranks and programs since 1991, and
already was to see a five billion dollar reduction in funding over five
years. Last month, it froze all new hiring.
It expects to have 14.26 billion dollars to spend in 1996, including
5.5 billion dollars for shuttle flights.
In a Washington Post article Monday detailing plans for the budget
reductions, Goldin for the first time gave his seal of approval to what
amounts to a cultural revolution in space exploration and research:
putting parts of the shuttle business on the auction block.
Private companies would not actually own the shuttles, but private
contractors would bid for the right to run launches and flight
operations.
Such a bold stroke, if surprising, is typical of Goldin, who was named
to his post by former president George Bush -- one of the few federal
agency administrators Clinton did not replace.
When Goldin first came to NASA in early 1992, he made a splash by
moving swiftly to prove that the agency -- known for its big budgets --
was ready to streamline. He hyped the idea of "faster, cheaper,
smaller" arguing it was time to favor small, non-manned space missions
over pricey shuttle flights.
Two launcher systems that effectively would replace shuttles, the X-33
and X-34, are being studied. They would cost about 100 million dollars,
instead of the shuttles' big-ticket 600 million dollars.
Goldin told the Post the goal was to achieve even better flexibility,
making it easier to launch new programs when necessary with greater
ease.
NASA's administrator also has an undeniable political flair: the
privatization idea has been pushed by House of Representatives speaker
Newt Gingrich, and Goldin likely would prefer organizing such an
operation himself rather than face the Republican-run Congress' own
budget-busting handiwork.
