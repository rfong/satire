Ross to Make New Bid for Mideast Peace Process 
U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross will travel to the Middle East at the
end of the next week in a fresh attempt to break a deadlock in peace
talks between Israel and the Palestinians, the State Department said on
Wednesday.
Ross will go to the region "beginning the weekend of April 24" for
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasir Arafat, the State Department said in a written statement.
"The purpose of the trip is to continue to work on the basis of U.S.
ideas and to help focus the parties on the decisions that need to be
made if an agreement is to be reached," the State Department said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-illan disclosed the
trip to the press, saying: "Ross is arriving to continue talks on ways
to advance the peace process."
Last month, Ross shuttled between Netanyahu and Arafat in a bid to
bring them again to the negotiating table for peace process which has
been suspended for more than one year.
But the proposals he had brought on the percentage of israel's pullback
on the West Bank in the next stage of withdrawal was rejected by
Israel.
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has warned that if the two
sides do not make "hard decisions", Washington might be forced to wind
up the U.S.-brokered peace process in its current form.
