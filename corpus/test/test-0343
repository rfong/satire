Boeing in talks with Delta on short- and long-term deals 
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing said Tuesday it had had lengthy
talks with Delta Air Lines on both short- and long-term supply
possibilities.
But Boeing commercial aircraft spokeswoman Elizabeth Verdier did not
comment directly on a Wall Street Journal report that Boeing had
proposed a deal under which it would become the exclusive provider of
aircraft to Delta at guaranteed prices.
She said Boeing and Delta had held talks for more than six months on
Delta's upgrade requirements and had provided the carrier with "a range
of information, which included both short-term and long-term supply
options."
She was unable to characterize the current stage of the negotiations or
to disclose the potential financial value of a deal with Delta.
According to the Journal the airline is contemplating the purchase of
up to 100 planes valued at about six billion dollars.
"We are hopeful, of course, that our discussions with Delta will be
successful, but we can't say when a decision could be made," Verdier
said. "That's completely up to the purchaser."
A Delta Air Lines spokesman earlier confirmed the carrier had been
having "intense" talks with unspecified manufacturers as it sought
replacement aircraft.
Delta is in particular looking to buy some 24 wide-body jets to replace
its fleet of 49 Lockheed Martin L1011s, a craft that Lockheed no longer
produces, the Journal said.
Standard and Poor's analyst Stephen Klein said that while Delta's fleet
was not particularly old, at 11 years on average, the carrier was
capacity-constrained.
Simplification of its fleet range would lead to savings in maintenance,
he added.
