Katherine Harris put in charge of New Orleans Body Count
White House officials today announced former Florida
Secretary of State Katherine Harris would be put in charge of tallying
the body count in New Orleans. Harris has reportedly stated she is "not
going to count" bodies missing limbs, since they're effectively a
"hanging chad" and under Louisiana forensic law, will "disqualify" any
corpses without Louisiana voter registration cards or other proof of
residency. "I'm not saying a particular body wasn't FOUND in New
Orleans, but who knows, maybe they drowned in Arkansas two months ago
and simply floated down the river. Once they're in the morgue we have
no way to know which ones Katrina killed, and which ones died due to
bungled FEMA rescue ops, err, natural causes.
Putting the best possible spin on the body count has quickly become a
Republican obsession, with their Karl Rove reportedly brainstorming
ideas on how President Bush can "survive the storm" of duelling body
counts each evening - Iraq versus New Orleans. The president's brother,
Jeb Bush, Governor of Florida reportedly came up with the suggestion to
put Ms. Harris in charge.
FEMA has "delayed and stalled" giving body counts about as long as it
can get away with, said White House spokesperson Scott McClellan. "Like
it or not, at some point, we have to start ordering body bags, and that
requires a number." For victims who have been "dined on" by alligators,
"Hefty Extra Tough" bags may suffice, said McClellan.
Other ideas "floated" by Rove included counting legs, and dividing by
two, and simply "making up a number" and sticking to it, like they did
with the number of WMD's in Iraq. "A lie, repeated often enough, starts
sounding like the truth" commented McClellan, who ought to know.
And IBM/Diebold consortium will reportedly receive a $3.2B contract for
consulting services and computers to assist in tabulating the count.
T1's will be installed between morgues, hospitals, and the Superdome so
that viewers can always have the latest #'s.
Asked why they couldn't simply use numbered toe-tags, and at the end of
each day count how many remained, McClellan commented, Diebold
developed this system, and we have faith in it. It worked in 2004, it
will work in New Orleans.
