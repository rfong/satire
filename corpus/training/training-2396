12 Firms Bidding for Right to Operate Colombian Railroad 
Twelve Colombian and foreign companies are competing in a public
auction for the right to operate Colombia's Atlantic Railroad System,
the Colombian railroad company Ferrovias announced today.
Five Colombian and seven foreign companies from Spain, Mexico, Brazil,
Germany, Chile and the United States are taking part in the bidding,
Ferrovias said.
One of the main branches of the Atlantic Railroad System is the Santa
Marta-La Loma Railroad, which is estimated to transport some 30 million
tons of coal a year.
Ferrovias will spend 45 days to evaluate and grant the licensed rights
to a suitable company for the operation, maintenance and rehabilitation
of the Atlantic Railroad System for the next 30 years, beginning in
1998.
The government's share in the operation of the railroad will be worth
140 million U.S. dollars.
