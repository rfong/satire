Gulf Air confident of breaking even after three years 
Gulf Air's new president expressed his confidence Sunday that a
cost-cutting restructure plan introduced this month will drag the
cash-strapped airline back into the black within three years.
"As a large airline, Gulf Air has all the ingredients to rebuild and
reposition itself. Our network is still the most extensive in the
region," Australian James Hogan told reporters here.
Gulf Air, which saw 2001 profits plummet 34.9 percent to 132.3 million
dollars from 98.1 million dollars in 2000, "will break even after three
years," said Hogan, previously CEO of Ansett Airlines in Australia and
BMI British Midlands Airways.
On June 9, Hogan unveiled a customer-focused plan, drawn up with
US-based aviation consultants Simet Hellielson and Eicher, that
envisages a three-year turn around for Gulf Air.
Qatar decided to quit Gulf Air last month, leaving the governments of
Bahrain, Oman and Abu Dhabi as sole owners of the airline, which has a
32-strong fleet and flies to some 50 destinations.
The three pledged to immediately inject around 80 million dollars into
Manama-based Gulf Air, which was set up in 1974.
Gulf aviation analysts have traced the airline's turbulence to the
launch by Oman and Qatar of their own carriers -- Oman Air and Qatar
Airways -- despite staying in Gulf Air, which has seen passengers
dwindle.
