Nine South American countries play a round-robin championship and the
top four teams join Brazil, who qualify automatically as champions, in
the finals.
Canada, Costa Rica, United States, Honduras, Mexico and Salvador, plus
three Central American and three Caribbean qualifiers, will be split
into three groups in the CONACAF zone. The top two from each group will
play a final round to decide which three qualify for 1998.
For the first time in Asia, the teams will not be divided into east and
west but all drawn together into 10 groups. The winners will split into
two groups of five each and the top two from each group will contest
the Asian finals in a neutral country.
The best three of these four will qualify for France and the fourth
will play off against the Oceania winner.
Australia and New Zealand will be seeded in the Oceania zone and the
remaining eight teams drawn into each group. The eventual winner of a
play-off between the top team in each group will play off -- home and
away -- against the fourth-best Asian team for a place in the 1998
finals.
This is one stage less than Australia had to take to try to qualify for
USA 94. In 1993 they had play-offs against first Canada, the
second-best team from CONCACAF, and then against the fourth-best South
American team.
Diego Maradona made one of his many comebacks to lead Argentina to a
lucky win in Buenos Aires.
Altogether, the 171 countries will play more than 700 matches to
qualify for France where for the first time there will be 32 countries.
