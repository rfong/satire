Military Kills 10 Civilians In Kashmir 
At least 10 civilians were killed in Kashmir when the military fired
gunshots after its convoy was attacked by the Muslim rebels using land
mines, police said Saturday.
Harkat ul-Ansar, a pro-Pakistan militant outfit, claimed responsibility
for the attack and the killing of five soldiers on Friday.
Two houses were burned to ground in an exchange of gunfire between the
military and the guerrillas in Khiramsirhma village in Anantnag
district, 60 kilometers (35 miles) south of Srinagar, the summer
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, police said.
The militants are fighting a separatist war in the state since late
1989. Nearly 11,600 people have been killed in the past five years.
