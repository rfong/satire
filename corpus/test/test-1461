Utility Sector to be Opened to Private Sector in Tanzania
The Tanzanian government today announced besides the health and
education sectors, the utility and infrastructure sectors will also be
opened to the private sector.
Opening a workshop on private participation in infrastructure here
today, Minister for State in the Prime Minister's Office, Kingunge
Ngombale Mwiru said the main initiative being taken by the government
is re-assessment of its continued participation in the operations of
infrastructure and utility sectors.
He said the current water crisis in Dar es Salaam and the electricity,
telecommunications, ports and railways problems facing the country for
a couple of years are indications of the inadequacy of the government
resources to provide for the country's needs in the economic
development process.
Mwiru urged the private businessmen to participate in management and
development of the utility sector in the country.
He also urged the participants to the workshop to address themselves to
the question of ownership, adding that they should explore all types of
ownership or operational arrangements that are likely to deliver the
required results.
"The important objective we want to achieve is consistent and adequate
availability of infrastructure services at an acceptable quality level
and at affordable prices," he stressed.
Mwiru further called upon the participants to clearly elaborate on the
regulation of firms in the utility and infrastructure sectors.
Meanwhile, the minister for state reiterated the government's
commitment to bringing about increased efficiency of the former public
enterprises through increased participation of the private capital and
management in the development process in the country.
He said the thrust of reforms in the country and the policy changes go
beyond merely providing for corrective measures on the economy.
The government's reform policies under implementation are aimed at
distancing the government day-to-day operational issues in the
productive and service delivery sectors and leaving itself with major
role of overall economic policy formulation and creation of a conducive
environment for investment.
