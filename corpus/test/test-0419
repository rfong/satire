NATO Bombs Serb Positions Third Time in Three Days
NATO warplanes targeted Bosnian Serb missile positions Wednesday,
striking at one target twice to make sure it ceased being a threat to
aircraft of the Atlantic Alliance.
About about 20 NATO attack and support planes from the United States,
Britain, France and the Netherlands struck at least two Serb
surface-to-air missile sites in a morning raid. A statement issued by
NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, said war planes hit one of the
targets again in the afternoon after it became clear that the first
raid did not put it out of commission.
U.N. and alliance sources said a third site may also have been hit in
the first raid. It was the first time NATO, either acting on the United
Nations' or to protect itself, has struck at multiple targets in any
single day.
Commenting on Wednesday's first raid, Capt. Jim Mitchell, a NATO
spokesman in Naples, Italy, said the warplanes fired after being locked
onto by Serb anti-aircraft radar. U.N. and NATO sources said at least
two, and maybe three targets were attacked.
After Tuesday's close-call, in which two surface-to-air missiles were
fired at two NATO warplanes over Serb-held Bosnia, NATO dispatched
warplanes to escort reconnaissance aircraft flying regular patrols over
Bosnia, Mitchell said.
The NATO planes were locked onto by three Serb surface-to-air missile
sites -- in Otoka and Bosanska Krupa, in Bosnia, and in Dvor, just over
the border in Serb-held Croatia.
``The aircraft responded by firing three missiles at at least two of
the sites,'' Mitchell said. He could not immediately confirm reports
that a third missile site had been hit, and he refused to say which two
sites had been targeted.
The NATO statement said alliance aircraft again struck at the Otoka
missile site ``since it was clear that the site posed a continued
threat'' to the aircraft.
NATO sources in Brussels told The Associated Press that Wednesday's air
action began after NATO warplanes were dispatched to bomb the Serb
missile site at Otoka, 25 kilometers (15 miles) northeast of Bihac,
believed to have carried out Tuesday's attack on the Harriers. They
went after the other two sites after being locked on by Serb radar, the
sources said.
``This is our right to defend the pilots who are required to fly in
that area,'' Adm. Leighton Smith, NATO commander for southern Europe,
said on CNN. ``These missiles were fired in self-defense.''
Before Wednesday, NATO aircraft had struck at Serb targets seven
previous times since the Bosnian war began in April 1992. On Monday,
nearly 50 alliance war planes participated in a strike on a military
airfield in Serb-held Croatia that had been used to bomb the U.N.
``safe area'' of Bihac, in Bosnia.
The Belgrade news agency Tanjug, quoting Serb military sources, claimed
NATO planes had hit ``several military and civilian targets'' in
Bosnia. The Bosnian Serb self-styled parliament was meeting in Pale,
east of Sarajevo, on Wednesday to discuss the Bosnian Serbs' next move.
It was unclear what reaction Wednesday's strike would elicit from the
Bosnian government, since it did not address the urgent pleas to help
save Bihac, a town of 48,000.
They had criticized Monday's airstrike on the Udbina airfield in
Serb-held Croatia as too limited. At U.N. request, NATO bombed only the
taxi and takeoff areas and left Serb warplanes intact. The Udbina
strike was retaliation for three Serb bombing raids on the Bihac
pocket, including two on the town itself.
Up to eight artillery shells hit the Bihac ``safe area'' overnight, and
Serb forces may have entered the restricted zone, U.N. officials said.
Lt. Col. Jan-Dirk von Merveldt, a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo, said the
situation in Bihac was ``very disturbing.''
Serbs were just 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) southwest of Bihac town,
Bosnian army sources claimed, and they described the battlefield
situation as critical.
Ham radio operators in Bihac sent urgent pleas to the outside world for
food and medicine and told of large numbers of refugees pouring into
town.
U.N. sources reported that villages to the south and west of Bihac were
ablaze from heavy fighting. Bihac is one of six ``safe areas'' in
Bosnia created by the United Nations to protect civilians from
fighting.
U.N. personnel throughout Bosnia were on heightened alert Wednesday.
Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, was
``thinning out'' personnel in high-risk areas, such as those guarding
weapons collection points, ``to minimize the risk of U.N. personnel
being taken hostage,'' said Maj. Koos Sol, a U.N. spokesman.
But Sol said later that Bosnian Serb blocked all nine U.N. weapons
collection points and were not permitting peace keepers to leave. Sol
said more than 150 U.N. troops were affected.
The Bosnian Serbs additionally ordered all U.N. military observers on
territory they hold to remain in their quarters, said Sol.
In a further sign of the deteriorating situation, Bosnian government
and Serb forces battled with tanks and heavy weapons inside the
Sarajevo weapons exclusion zone Tuesday night, said von Merveldt. A car
carrying the U.N. commander for Sarajevo, Brig Gen. Herve Gobilliard,
was caught in crossfire but there were no injuries. Sarajevo's
humanitarian airlift remained suspended, as did the city's tram
service.
Akashi flew to Belgrade on Wednesday to meet with Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic and Milan Martic, leader of rebel Serbs in Croatia,
who have joined Bosnian Serbs in the Bihac offensive. Akashi was
expected to ask Milosevic to use his influence to halt the Serb
attacks.
Milosevic, whose nationalist rhetoric spurred the rebellion by Bosnia's
Serb minority in 1992, froze all but humanitarian aid to Bosnian Serbs
in August to punish them for failing to accept an international peace
plan. That isolation encouraged the alliance between Bosnia's and
Croatia's Serbs.
International warnings that they faced further NATO action appeared
lost on the Serbs, who after Monday's airstrike used a helicopter
gunship, in violation of the U.N. ``no-fly'' zone over Bosnia, as well
as tanks to attack the Bihac pocket.
Bosnia's government run news agency, BH press, reported that three Serb
war planes bombed the town of Buzim, north of Bihac, causing ``huge
damage'' and killing or wounding a ``high number of victims.'' NATO
spokesmen in Naples, Italy, said they knew nothing of such bombing
raids.
Aid officials warned of an impending humanitarian crisis. Peter
Kessler, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said
about 8,000 civilians had fled villages under attack over the last few
days. He said the area was running out of food, and in some places,
potable water, and blamed Serbs in Croatia for obstructing UNHCR aid
convoys.
