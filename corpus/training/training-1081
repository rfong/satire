Women's pro baseball league will open in Europe 
A six-team European women's professional baseball league, backed by
organizers of a US women's team, will open next June in France, Spain
and Italy, officials said here Thursday.
The Mediterranean Baseball League will feature players from among 2,500
who tries out for the Colorado Silver Bullets touring US team. US
college coaches will instruct teams of 20 players, five of whom will be
from the host nation.
"People in Europe love sports and love anything that is American. This
league will be a big hit," director of operations for the league and a
former World League of American Football executive.
League cities have not been finalized but plans are to have Barcelona
and Valencia from Spain, Florence and Parma from Italy plus Nice and
Montpellier from France.
A marketing firm based here will operate the league, paying each player
5,000 dollars plus housing and meals. Each club will play 80 games from
mid-June through August.
Teams will be developed from training camps that begin May 5 in Fort
Myers, Florida. On June 1, teams will depart for Europe and two weeks
of on-site training before the season begins.
"We're using this league to provide first-rate baseball to European
sports fans," league chairman Robert Hope said. "It just happens the
players will be women."
Baseball stadiums are available in Barcelona, Parma and Florence. The
other cities will likely use converted football stadiums.
