Egypt wants European special envoy to Middle East 
Egypt "encourages" the idea of naming a special European Union (EU)
envoy for the Middle East, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said
here Monday.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak "encourages Italy to go ahead with the
idea of naming an EU special envoy and gradually increasing the
European role in the area," Prodi told journalists after talks with
Mubarak.
Asked about Israel's rejection of European mediation, Prodi said at the
end of a 24-hour visit: "I never mentioned mediation, but there is a
European role and it will expand in the future.
"There is, in effect, a European presence in the area and this presence
must be demonstrated by actions."
Prodi said Mubarak is "pessimistic" because of the evolution of the
peace process and "says that European and Italian pressure would help
convince Israel to implement the agreements it concluded with the
Palestinians."
"Europe can't be satisfied with the role of financier because this is
the stuff of novels, not reality," Prodi said. "Is it realistic that we
would continue to pay for years while keeping quiet?"
The EU provides the largest amount of funding for the Palestinian
Authority.
He said that his visit to Egypt and French President Jacques Chirac's
tour of the region "are parallel," and added, "I hope that they will
both contribute to peace in the Middle East."
Chirac was in Israel on Monday.
Prodi also said that "Mubarak insists that the embargo (imposed on Iraq
and Libya) should have limits and conditions, especially concerning
Libya as (Libyan leader) Moamer Kadhafi is being more cooperative with
the West."
