Thai Banks Given Deadline to Transfer NPLs 
The Thai Asset Management Corp (TAMC), Thailand's newly-founded
official debt administration, has set a deadline of October 8 for
private banks to decide if they will transfer their nonperforming loans
(NPLs) to it, the state-owned radio reported Sunday.
Meanwhile, state-run banks are ordered to unconditionally transfer
their bad loans to the central asset management agency, starting
October 15.
TAMC president Yodchai Choosri was quoted as saying that he expected
private banks would turn over all of the targeted NPLs worth some 8
billion U.S. dollars while state-owned banks would transfer 25 billion
dollars.
Private banks intending to cooperate with the TAMC will have to sign
NPL-transfer agreement with the government.
Yodchai said presently Thailand's NPL level would be lower than the
figure combined by possible transfer from both government and private
banks, because some of the banks have succeeded in debt restructuring
by themselves.
The TAMC will restructure and sell the NPLs it receives, depending on
their quality.
However, a senior central bank official cautioned that the terror
attacks in U.S. could affect Thailand's ongoing debt restructuring
process.
