Nordiques Ask for More Time to Consider Province Offer 
The Quebec Nordiques have asked for more time to consider an offer from
the province to keep the National Hockey League team from moving to
Denver.
Premier Jacques Parizeau said Thursday talks are to continue between
the NHL club and government negotiator Andre Joli-Coeur.
``I've agreed not to make our proposal public for another couple of
days so discussions can go on,'' Parizeau said. ``There are discussions
at the present time and I'm watching them closely.''
He added that details of the government offer, which appeared in news
reports Wednesday, were ``incomplete.''
Radio-Canada reported the province offered to buy dlrs 17 million in
shares of the team and absorb dlrs 14 million of the club's debts over
the next two seasons.
Montreal La Presse had a similar report, but added the government would
cover the difference to the team's five major shareholders if the value
of the franchise diminishes in two years.
Both sides have remained silent on the government offer delivered
Tuesday to the Nordiques.
The Nordiques received a dlrs 75 million offer from Comsat Video
Enterprises of Denver to purchase the franchise and move it to Colorado
for next season.
Marcel Aubut, the Nordiques' president and part-owner, rejected an
earlier offer of a two-year aid package.
He said the team needs a government-financed 19,000-seat arena and
long-term help with its debts to stay competitive in the NHL.
The club is expected to lose dlrs 10 million next season and dlrs 12
million the following year playing out of the aging 15,399-seat
Colisee.
Aubut favors a new rink with a built-in casino, with gambling profits
to underwrite the club's deficits.
The provincial government, which this week announced a commission would
be formed to develop and promote the city, does not want a casino that
would take business from a new gambling house in the nearby Charlevoix
region.
