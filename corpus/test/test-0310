Current Situation Favorable for China: Magazine (2)
Thanks to the measures, this year China has achieved a good
agricultural harvest, a relatively high growth in industrial
production, an improving foreign trade that has halted its downward
trends in the early months of the year, a constant improvement in the
people's living standards, and social stability.
The economic goals China set in the beginning of this year are expected
to materialize, it says.
However, there still exist certain prominent problems and
contradictions in China's economy, such as the inefficiency of
effective market demands, an increasing pressure of unemployment, the
slowness in the growth of farmers' income, and an irrational economic
structure.
The fact that China has achieved a relatively high economic growth amid
the complicated international and domestic situation shows that the
ruling CPC, which managed to achieve a "soft- landing" for the
country's overheated economy and inflation in the mid-1990s, is also
capable of dealing with the current deflation under the new
circumstances.
It shows the ruling party has been able to manage a complicated
economic situation and tackle major economic issues, and meanwhile its
level of macro-economic management has been fundamentally improved.
