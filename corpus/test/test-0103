Eliot Spitzer hooker agency nets Brazilian footballer Ronaldo
NYPD investigators are cock-a-hoop after a sting op in the Eliot Spitzer
hooker agency probe netted Brazilian footballer and AC/DC Milan star
striker Ronaldo.
The 31 year-old international had been partying in the Lonesome Cowboy
Club in Rio's notoriously ambiguous Barrack da Tijuana red light
district when he caught the eye of five luscious lovelies, out on the
town and looking for frolics.
Six jeroboams of '96 Krug Grand Cuvee at $900 each later and the feisty
five-a-side team accepted an offer to go back to Ronaldo's fabled
Copacabana beachside condo.
In the words of the apartment block's night janitor, "a filthy row then
broke out in the penthouse's private elevator," where the pride of
Brazil's footballing hystery suddenly discovered his companions were
all female.
"Imagine the horror, the tackiness and the eventual froideur of it
all!" janitor Juan Bollzup told reporters.
Police soon arrived and broke up the brawl which began when Ronaldo
realised he'd been tricked into thinking his hookers were all bona fide
transvestites.
Subsequent investigations have shown that all five ladies of the night
were in Brazil on secondment from the NY branch of Spitzer's Holy Roman
Emperor VSOP agency following a lottery win during the Pope's visit to
the US.
David Beckham is thick as a brick.
