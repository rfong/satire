Renault Seeking Auto Plant Approval in Beijing 
The French auto company Renault is seeking Chinese government approval
to set up a joint venture assembly plant in Beijing to produce
multi-purpose vehicles (MPV).
Li Honglu, an official from Beijing Automotive Industry Group, said
that the company has put forward a plan for setting up a joint venture
with Renault to the central government for approval.
He said that the plan has won support from the government departments
that are in charge of the auto industry.
Li made the remarks at the Auto Parts, Manufacturing and Related
Products Show being held here this week.
The joint venture is designed to turn out some 30,000 Megane MPVs every
year. The Chinese name of the model is Scenic. The model won the best
car in Europe award in 1997 and 1998.
However, the Chinese government has made clear that it will not approve
the establishment of any car plant that has an annual production
capacity under 150,000 and it has not listed MPVs as cars on its
industrial catalogue. Therefore the proposed Renault joint venture does
not run against the country's industrial plan.
Li said that Beijing has been the production base of light vans and
cross-field vehicles in China and the new MPV plant would add a new
growth area to the local auto industry. He said that the Renault joint
venture will also help local auto parts companies to improve
technological standards and update products.
Renault is displaying two Scenic cars at the show. Yang Jungang,
director of the Sales Department of the Beijing Automotive Industry
Import and Export Corporation, said that the cars are currently sold at
prices around 290,000 yuan (35,000 US dollars) in China.
