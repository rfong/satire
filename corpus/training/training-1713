Historical Sites Found at Project Construction Sites in Xinjiang 
A great number of cultural relics have been found at the construction
sites of major projects in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
The finds include animal fossils and stone, pottery, gold, silver,
bronze and ironware dating from as early as the prehistorical period to
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
Chinese archaeologists especially value the discovery of fossils of a
rhinoceros found at the site of a railway station in Turfan, which are
believed to be the world's largest from the Tertiary Period (70
million-13,000 years ago).
The projects involve oil exploration in the Tarim Basin and Turfan
Basin, a railway line across the southern part of the region, and
express highways.
One of several provinces rich in cultural relics, Xinjiang has seen the
discovery of more than 4,000 historical sites.
