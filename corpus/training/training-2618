Predators deal club captain to Blackhawks 
The Chicago Blackhawks added grit and leadership to their National
Hockey League lineup on Wednesday by acquiring right wing Tom
Fitzgerald from the Nashville Predators for a fourth-round pick in the
2003 entry draft and future considerations.
Fitzgerald, 33, served as Nashville's captain since its inception
during the 1998-99 season.
"This trade was a very difficult move to make," Predators general
manager David Poile said. "Tom has been the consummate professional, a
terrific captain and he and his family have played an important part in
the growth of hockey here in Nashville."
A former member of the New York Islanders, Florida Panthers and
Colorado Avalanche, Fitzgerald is known for his defence and penalty
killing.
During his tenure with the Predators, Fitzgerald registered 42 goals
and 46 assists in 307 games. He has seven goals and nine assists in 63
games this season.
He has appeared in at least 80 games in each of his last four seasons
and missed just 23 games over the past decade.
Chicago also announced Boris Mironov would be sidelined at least two
weeks with a dislocated shoulder. The Russian defenceman suffered the
injury in the third period of Monday's game against Los Angeles.
