Queen refuses to interrupt holiday for Clinton: Observer 
A visit to London, Belfast and Dublin by US President Bill Clinton has
been put back because Queen Elizabeth II refused to interrupt her
holiday to meet him, the Observer newspaper said Sunday.
The visit had been planned for September, but has been put back until
later in the year, the paper said, quoting Irish sources, after the
queen declined to break her holiday in Balmoral, Scotland.
Protocol requires the queen to greet visiting heads of state.
Irish sources believe the queen is annoyed that Clinton declined to
attend Victory in Europe celebrations in London earlier this month.
He pleaded logistical difficulties, and after attending a ceremony in
Washington DC bypassed Britain to attend ceremonies in Moscow, the
paper pointed out.
Clinton's absence from the London ceremonies followed Downing Street
criticism of the US government for allowing Gerry Adams, president of
Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, to organise a
high-profile fund-raising visit to the United States in March.
British commentators have pointed out the electoral importance to
Clinton of the large Irish-American population.
