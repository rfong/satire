OIC committee on Jerusalem to meet in late March
An Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) committee dealing with
Jerusalem is to meet here in late March, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said Saturday at the end of a brief visit to Morocco.
The "Al Qods Committee," which takes its name from the Arabic for
Jerusalem, is to meet on March 27 and 28, Mubarak told reporters after
a meeting with King Hassan II.
The Moroccan king is the current chairman of the "Al Qods Committee,"
which comprises Egypt, Morocco, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
and 13 Arab or Islamic countries.
The committee meeting would be held at ministerial level and would
follow an extraordinary OIC summit being held in Islamabad on March 23
and 24 to discuss recent Israeli moves in Jerusalem and other issues.
Israel's controversial decision to build a new Jewish neighborhood in
disputed east Jerusalem was expected to be on the agenda.
Israel seized east Jerusalem in 1967 and considers it to be part of its
undivided capital. Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital
of a future Palestinian state.
