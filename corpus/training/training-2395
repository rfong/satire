AlliedSignal Expands Cooperation with Chinese Airlines 
AlliedSignal Aerospace on Thursday announced a six million US dollar
long-term agreement with Air China.
The company also announced the delivery of flight management systems
(FMS) valued at 3.6 million US dollars to two other Chinese airlines.
The agreement with Air China grants AlliedSignal exclusive rights to
supply advanced auxiliary power units for Air China's fleet of B737-300
aircraft. The auxiliary power units are designed to provide electricity
and pneumatic power for aircraft both on the ground and in flight.
The contract resulted from AlliedSignal's commitment to become a major
supplier of aerospace products in China, according to Tom Johnson,
vice-president of the company's Commercial Auxiliary Power Department.
China Eastern and China Northern airlines will replace older systems
with new FMS purchased from AlliedSignal, according to the senior
manager of AlliedSignal's communications and navigation systems.
The two airlines plan to use the global positioning system's receivers
as the primary means of navigation on oceanic and remote routes, and
for approaches to airports in poor visibility.
A separate agreement calls for AlliedSignal to provide FMS training to
some 300 pilots and maintenance personnel in seven Chinese cities.
AlliedSignal Aerospace, the world's largest supplier of aerospace
equipment and systems, has established three joint ventures in China.
AlliedSignal, the parent company, has invested a total of some 150
million US dollars in China.
