Expelled student shoots two teachers, kills self 
An expelled student returned to his old high school Thursday, shot dead
one teacher, critically wounded another and then killed himself, state
education officials said.
The incident occurred in the Blackville-Hilda High School in Blackwell,
a small rural town 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of the state capital
Columbia, according to Barbara Nielsen, state superintendent of
education.
David Beasley, governor of this southeastern US state, was en route to
the scene of the shooting as were a host of law enforcement
authorities, officials said.
Nielsen said the youth, whose name and age were not disclosed, had been
expelled from the high school.
He shot and killed one teacher and then critically wounded a second
before turning his gun upon himself, she said.
No other details were immediately available.
