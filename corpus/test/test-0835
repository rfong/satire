Share Prices Decline on Singapore Market 
Share prices declined on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits
Times Industrials Index (STII) lost 19.81 points to close at 1,471.47
points on Monday.
Dealers said that weakening Asian currencies and a dearth of
market-moving incentives kept many players on the sidelines. Persistent
concerns over the impact of the regional financial turmoil and economic
downturn on local companies continued to discourage investors, they
added.
The total market volume stood at 156.73 million units, worth 186.28
million Singapore dollars (about 116.43 million US dollars). Declines
overwhelmed advances by 286 to 48, while 262 other counters remained
unchanged.
RHB Capital Warrant99 was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 25.14 million units. It was followed by RHB
Capital which had 13.02 million shares traded. Easyknit was next with
10.63 million shares changed hands.
Elec&AMP;E led the gainers of the day as it rose by 35 cents to finish
at 5.8 US dollars. Parkway increased by 26 cents to end at 3.58
Singapore dollars. Parkway Warrant98 was up by 24 cents to close at
1.65 Singapore dollars.
