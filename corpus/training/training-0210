Croatia beat Greece 78-60 for the bronze medal. Those teams had the
most passionate supporters from this city's large ethnic communities.
Cheering, flag-waving followers helped attract 280,042 fans for 11 days
of competition.
NBA players Dino Radja and Toni Kukoc sparked the Croatians while the
Russians were guided by Sergei Bazarevich, who can already see the gap
narrowing between international and NBA players.
"Every game, we will get closer to them," Bazarevich said. "Eventually
there will not be such a gap."
International officials adopted rules for playing games under the NBA's
four 12-minute quarter system, even though they kept two 20-minute
halves for world tournament play.
They surprised some by not moving the three-point line out to NBA
distances, but the US league reduced their three-point line in
September to align the distances. The NBA move was among several aimed
at increased scoring after a season dominated by defense.
