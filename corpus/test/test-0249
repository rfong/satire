Man shoots self after gunbattle at Taiwan airport 
A Taiwanese man shot himself after a dramatic gunbattle with police at
an airport in the south of the country Sunday, which left one officer
wounded, airport officials said.
The man had arrived at Kaohsiung airport on a flight from the
Philippines and opened fire after customs officers found five pistols
strapped to his waist, they said.
Shih Chi-chin, 30, forced his way through the customs barrier and
headed for the main lobby where the gunbattle with police took place,
the officials said, adding that Shih collapsed wounded before turning
his gun on himself.
One police officer was wounded in the leg and was in hospital in stable
condition, they said.
Shih had arrived from Laoag in the Philippines aboard a Makung Airlines
flight, a local airline.
As well as the pistols police recovered seven cartridge clips, two
silencers and some 90 rounds of ammunition from Shih's body.
Police said they believed Shih, a Taipei resident with a criminal
record for drug and firearms possession, may have been trying to
smuggle the weapons into the country for sale to gang members.
