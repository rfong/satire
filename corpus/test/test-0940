Japanese to Challenge for WBA Junior Lightweight Title 
Yamato Mitani of Japan will challenge South Korean Choi Yong-Soo for
the World Boxing Association (WBA) junior lightweight title on January
27, his promoters said on Thursday.
It would be the first time for Choi to defence his title won in
October.
The 23-year-old Korean enjoyed a record of 18 wins against two defeats.
Challenger Mitani became the national champion in June and won the
Oriental Pacific Boxing Federation title last month.
In October last year, the 25-year-old Japanese lost to Choi in a
non-title match.
He had seven wins against one defeat, including six knockouts.
