19 people killed as KwaZulu-Natal election nears 
At least 19 people were killed in KwaZulu-Natal province during the 24
hours to Wednesday morning, police spokesman Vish Naidoo said.
Naidoo gave no motives for the killings, just one week before the
province's June 26 elections for municipal and rural councils.
The latest deaths included two people killed in their beds by unknown
attackers near Donneybrook, Naidoo said.
The rural community south of here has been a hotbed of political
violence recently that has continued unabated despite a peace
initiative last month by the province's two rival political groups,
Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) and Mangosuthu
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
In all, close to 20,000 people have died -- 1,800 since January --
during an 11-year struggle for power in KwaZulu-Natal between the ANC
and IFP.
Most of South Africa voted for local government councils last November,
with parts of the Western Cape going to the polls in May.
Voting in KwaZulu-Natal, however, was postponed twice because of
political disputes and the ongoing violence.
The poll is seen as the first major popularity test for the IFP that
rules KwaZulu-Natal's provincial government -- which will not be
affected by next week's election -- since South Africa's first
democratic elections in 1994.
