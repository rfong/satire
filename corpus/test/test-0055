China, Taiwan court Liberia's warlords-turned-candidates
China and Taiwan's battle for international
recognition now finds them vying to please the retired warlords who
ruined distant Liberia, a country which absurdly both claim diplomatic
ties with.
Two former militia leaders, now turned presidential candidates, have
recently been on high-profile trips to East Asia.
Charles Taylor, the man who set off the bloodbath in 1989, visited
Taipei in February on an official visit which left him at odds with
much of the fractious government in Monrovia.
His erstwhile battlefield enemy Alhaji Kromah received similar red
carpet treatment on a visit to Beijing in December, including a meeting
with President Jiang Zemin.
With elections expected later this year, the fighters who raped and
pillaged the west African country have finally given up most of their
weapons.
But despite the more than 150,000 dead in the seven-year conflict,
several former faction leaders are in the running to be elected
president. And both Beijing and Taipei are keen to ensure that their
"ties" stick.
Beijing's communist government claims to be the sole legitimate
government of all of China, including Taiwan which it regards as a
renegade province that it will eventually recover.
Taiwan, under a Nationalist government, is still smarting from the
decision by South Africa last year to switch recognition to Beijing.
Senegal a few months earlier switched ties in the other direction,
joining a handful of other African countries which are retaining ties
with Taipei.
Both governments are prepared to put their money where their mouths
are. Kromah brought back an agreement for technical and economic
cooperation with China.
On his return Taylor told supporters that Taipei had agreed to provide
500 million dollars worth of assistance to help rebuild the country.
The money would be given "in the weeks to come once positive signal is
given," he said.
And he, Kromah, and a third retired warlord, George Boley, have all
subsequently confirmed they are running for the presidency.
Liberia's links with the Chinese world have flicked back and forth
several times. Monrovia first switched from Taiwan to the People's
Republic in 1976. It retained links with Beijing as it gradually slid
towards anarchy under military ruler Samuel Doe in the 1980s.
But in October 1989, two months before the civil war broke out, Taiwan
signed a communique with Doe's government to switch ties back again.
Taipei opened an embassy, and kept it open during the carnage of the
early stages of the war.
Doe is not around any more to explain his decision. Amid mayhem in
Monrovia, he was captured in 1990 and tortured to death by rivals who
videoed the event.
Then in 1993, a weak interim government restored links with Beijing, a
decision Taiwan has refused to accept.
Senior foreign ministry official Yang Chin-tien has called it "some
Liberia factional leaders' unilateral, unlawful decision," although the
government concerned was in fact led by a lawyer and non-combatant,
Amos Sawyer.
Ironically the man who launched the rebellion against Doe -- Taylor --
is now Taipei's staunchest ally in Liberia. Taylor was not part of
Sawyer's government and has courted Taiwan.
Taylor recently sent staunch ally John Cummings as 'ambassador' to
Taipei, saying the appointment would last "until an elected government
can decide."
That move and Taylor's own visit in February brought him harsh
criticism from other parts of the Liberian government, despite the
lavish promises of aid he brought back.
The head of Liberia's ruling council of state, Ruth Perry, issued a
statement saying in no uncertain terms: "The government of Liberia has
diplomatic relations only with the People's Republic of China and not
Taiwan."
She called for Cummings' suspension after reports he had ignored
government directives to abandon his mission in Taiwan.
Beijing made it clear to South African President Nelson Mandela last
year that it does not accept the principle of dual ties, and the debate
over Liberia is not likely to go away.
