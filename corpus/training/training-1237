Manila Urged to Intensify Copyright Protection 
The Philippine government must provide a strong legal foundation of
copyright and other intellectual property protection to develop its
information technology (IT) industry, an expert said Thursday here
during a meeting.
Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance (BSA),
commended the Philippine government's efforts to protect intellectual
property rights and combat software piracy.
He said these efforts have contributed towards the reduction of the
software piracy rate in the Philippines in the last two years.
However, Holleyman said that the piracy rate was still high and he
urged the government to further intensify its efforts.
He stressed that the entire software industry is built upon the
foundation of copyright and other intellectual property protection.
"This foundation is the very incentive for developing software and it
provides a market-driven reward for successful products," Holleyman
said.
The BSA represents the world's leading software developers and educates
computer users on software piracy in more than 60 countries.
Holleyman announced that the BSA and the Philippine Software
Association will join hands to promote the growth of the Philippine
software industry and to work together in tackling intellectual piracy
issues of common interest.
In his speech, Holleyman also emphasized the importance of ratifying
and implementing the new World Intellectual Property Organization
Copyright Treaty adopted by the international community in December
1996.
