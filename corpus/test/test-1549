Nobel prize winner dies at 55, says friend of writer 
Nobel Prize winning poet Joseph Brodsky, a star of post-war Russian
literature, has died at the age of 55, a source close to the writer
said Sunday.
The source, Thomas Bishop, the president of the New York University
center for french culture and civilization, said that Brodsky died on
Sunday but did not know the circumstances of the death.
The Russian television network NTV reported that Brodsky died of a
heart ailment in the United States and would be buried in New York,
where he lived.
Brodsky, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1987, was sentenced
to five years' hard labor in the Arkhangelsk region for "social
parasitism" in 1964 but the sentence was commuted the following year.
The poet left Russia in 1973 for exile in the United States, where he
became a naturalized citizen.
Brodsky's works included "A Stop in the Desert," "To Urania," "Verses
on the Death of T.S. Eliot" and the play "Democracy."
Born May 24, 1940 in Leningrad, Brodsky showed an early taste for
non-conformity. He left school at the age of 15, getting by on odd jobs
and poetry.
Impassioned by literature and language, Brodksy began writing poems in
1955.
During his stay in the labor camp, the poet threw himself into the
translation of works by John Donne and Czeslaw Milosz -- tasks for
which he learned Polish and English.
Milosz, himself a Nobel laureate, in 1980 hailed the Brodsky's prose as
"a strong presence ... (that) has needed less than a decade to
establish itself in world poetry."
