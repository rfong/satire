World Recession Hits Bling Bling
The International slow in economic growth has finally hit the hip-hop
community, as financiers report a 23' drop in bling-bling since July.
Based on figures for the last fiscal year, the rate of bling-bling has
dropped for the first time this decade. The global recession is blamed,
though domestic influences such as the dumping of P Diddy by J-Lo may
have indirectly contributed.
The recession has seen artists such as Lil' Kim, Dr Dre and P Diddy
himself tightening their belts in preparation for a further slide in
growth. Staff at Jay Z's favourite restaurant reported that, rather
than his usual 6 bottles of Crissy, the rapper opted for a glass of the
house white. The economic downturn has also seen Lil' Kim wearing a
gold-plated choker adorned with Cubic Zirconias to a recent movie
premier. Reports of a drive-by shooting conducted from a Honda Civic
are as yet unconfirmed.
In the City, traders are optimistic that pick-ups in the prices of Gold
and "Ice" are a sign that the bling bling situation will soon be
upgraded from "nasty" to "whack". In the meantime, P Diddy's
spokesperson has stated that Puff is no longer All About the Benjamins,
but will be All About the Franklins until further notice.
