Expert on Battered Women Criticized for Backing Simpson Defense 
A psychologist who was instrumental in bringing the concept of
battered-woman syndrome into courtrooms nationwide has shocked and
disturbed some colleagues by agreeing to testify in O.J. Simpson's
defense.
Some advocates and lawyers working in the field accuse Lenore Walker of
abandoning the work she has championed for 20 years.
Walker countered that she does not believe Simpson is guilty or
innocent -- only that he deserves a fair trial.
``I think a number of people have rushed to a very harsh judgment
without understanding what my role could be in the case,'' the
52-year-old Denver psychologist said Monday.
Prosecutors contend the killing of Nicole Brown Simpson was the
culmination of years of violence and degradation.
Walker -- whose stand was outlined in opening statements by Simpson
lawyer Johnnie Cochran -- said she will testify that Simpson lacks
certain behavior traits often seen in husbands who murder, and that not
all abusers kill.
``I'm saying you cannot prove his guilt or innocence by the domestic
violence evidence in the case,'' she said.
Walter Gerash, a Denver lawyer who has called on Walker's expertise,
said she may trip over her own research, which frequently deals with
cycles of violence.
``I think her works are such that if they can show Simpson fits that
pattern, she's going to be in trouble,'' he said.
``If Mr. Cochran accurately represented what Dr. Walker will testify to
in court, she is wrong in her assessment of this relationship, and
contradicts her own writings and research in domestic violence,'' said
Rita Smith, director of the National Coalition Against Domestic
Violence.
And Rob Gallup of Abusive Men Exploring New Directions -- AMEND, based
in Denver -- took issue with Walker claim that Simpson does not exhibit
the traits of an ``antisocial personality disorder.''
``That really does battered women a disservice,'' Gallup said.
According to Walker, antisocial personality disorder is a precursor of
a possible lethal attack, and its symptoms include continued stalking,
abusiveness toward children and fighting over custody and visitation.
Walker, who holds degrees in education and psychology from Rutgers
University, has written 10 books on domestic violence, including ``The
Battered Woman'' in 1979. She has tried to debunk myths about the
thought patterns of women in abusive relationships.
Walker, who has known Cochran since the early 1980s, said she and
another psychologist interviewed a ``very cooperative'' Simpson for 40
hours and plan to spend more time questioning him.
