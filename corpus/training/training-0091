Orioles place outfielder Marty Cordova on 15-day 
Marty Cordova, the Baltimore Orioles' prized offseason acquisition, will
miss the opening two weeks of the baseball season with a right quadriceps
strain.
The 32-year-old outfielder, who signed a three-year, 9.1 million-dollar
contract in the offseason, had a rough spring, hitting .238 but was
being counted on to provide the Orioles some pop in the middle of the
lineup.
Last season with Cleveland, Cordova hit .301 with 20 homers and 69 RBI
in 409 at-bats.
To fill Cordova's roster spot, the Orioles recalled outfielder Larry
Bigbie from Rochester of the International League (AAA). Bigbie was one
the team's final cuts coming out of spring training.
