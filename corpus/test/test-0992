The murder happened on Super Bowl Sunday. It happened before a game I
was watching at home on television. It's my Sunday-morning ritual: my
cocker spaniel, a pot of coffee and Italian soccer.
When I saw the sunny stadium in Genoa, the banners waving, the fans
chanting, great athletes performing, I wished I could be there. But I'm
not naive. When I daydream about being at a game, I mean in the press
box, behind barricades. I've been to a few games in Italy, drawn to
soccer the way some of my colleagues are drawn to covering war. And
sometimes in Italy, soccer becomes war, the old city-states reviving,
Lombards fighting Ligurians, in sneakers and jeans.
They suspended the game at halftime on Super Bowl Sunday. A 24-year-old
man from Genoa was killed by the knife of an 18-year-old from Milan,
according to the police. The two men don't sound that different,
according to the early reports -- city kids without much education or
job prospects and no criminal past, the only major difference being the
colors of the team scarves they probably wore around their necks. And
next Sunday all national-league sports will be suspended in Italy, a
good first step in the search for sanity.
Is any sports rivalry worth a life? This is a question Americans might
ask as we head into a season of March Madnesses and state tournaments
and city championships. It's not enough for Americans to say smugly,
``Well, you know, it's soccer,'' as if a sport in which most players
cannot use their hands is bound to make fans desperate enough to wield
knives.
Soccer is only the excuse for violence. It's the most popular sport in
the world, so terrible things are committed in its name. The tough guys
who crowd into Italian stadiums on Sunday often call themselves
Naziskins or Ultras, almost as if they had some coherent right-wing
political view of the world.
But really their passions are visceral and regional in ways Americans
cannot imagine. Recently, ultras from the two Rome teams, Roma and
Lazio, combined for a vicious foray to northern Brescia. I've seen some
ominous stuff at games in Naples and Milan. It happens most Sundays,
most stadiums, but now somebody has been murdered on his way to the
game.
``I don't like this soccer any more,'' said Vincenzo Torrente, the
Genoa captain. ``It seems to me that I've seen a nightmare,'' he said
of the fighting outside the stadium. ``I think soccer must be pure
amusement, that you must go to a game to watch a pretty spectacle.
Parents must be comfortable when a son goes to a stadium, instead of
thinking that every Sunday he goes out, there could be a war.''
The players don't want to be the excuse for any more deaths. There is
talk of playing in neutral sites, empty stadiums, banning travel to
road games, but that's hard to do when most teams are only a few hours
apart by good train lines. The real problem is the anger or hatred
toward strangers from other cities, other teams, but Europe hardly
corners the market on violence.
Europeans are well aware of the random violence -- the drive-by
shootings, gang warfare, muggings, drug killings, having nothing to do
with sport -- that flares in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, all over.
Can we dare say we don't have violence like European soccer?
High-school sports in many cities are curtailed because of violence.
Many parents complain about the fighting and the language the last time
they went to a major-league baseball stadium, particularly at night,
when people were drinking.
Monday night football with its 9 p.m. starts has produced some ghastly
brawls. Bleacher-bum types in every town have thrown missiles at
visiting players. Hockey fans scream for blood. And ask Patrick Ewing
and Allen Iverson about some of the things they've heard on the road
with Georgetown University, more than a decade apart.
What about the dissing and the taunting? What about the bad
sportsmanship allowed by basketball franchises like Indiana and
Charlotte, where the visitors are bombared by obnoxious noise? What
about the verbal abuse on talk radio or combat-television? What about
the back-page headlines that tell coaches to get out of town? Day by
day, step by step, we're sending out messages that some people, some
teams, are just not worthy of respect. We're creating our own vendettas
that Europe took centuries to build. In a nation as armed as this one,
that's playing with fire.
