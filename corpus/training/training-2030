Mandela to Visit India Next Week 
South African President Nelson Mandela will pay a three-day visit to
India from January 24 and will be the chief guest at India's national
day parade, official sources said here today.
India and South Africa enjoy special relations for India's father M. K.
Gandhi had spelt a long time in that country. Tens of thousands of the
Indians are still working there. India supported Mandela's struggle
against apartheid in South Africa and invited him to visit India soon
after he was elected president of his country.
India and South Africa are set to cement ties by signing several
framework agreements during Mandela's visit including a declaration on
the principles of inter-state relations and cooperation to guide the
future course of the relationship between the two countries.
An Indo-South Africa joint commission will also be set up to steer
economic and cultural ties, the same sources said.
In their talks, Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and Mandela
are expected to examine the pros and cons of setting up a multilateral
grouping of countries on the Indian ocean rim. The idea was discussed
when South African Foreign Minister Pahad visited India in November
last year.
India has offered to collaborate in building one million low cost
houses in South Africa to shelter the country's homeless and also
develop its small-scale industrial infrastructure to tackle the growing
unemployment problem, the sources added.
