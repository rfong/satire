14 killed as suicide bomber devastates Israeli restaurant ATTENTION
A suicide bomber killed himself and 14 diners when he blew himself up in a
restaurant in Haifa on Sunday in a blast so powerful that the roof of the
one-storey building caved in, police said.
The deadly explosion, just across the street from a gas station,
le8ucnother 35 people injured.
The restaurant's interior was a mass of twisted metal and broken bodies
as police and ambulance workers pulled the injured from the wreckage.
A shocked witness recounted seeing people in flames after the blast in
this northern Israeli port city. The human bomb attack came less than
24 hours after a kamikaze killed himself and injured 29 in a Tel Aviv
cafe.
"Watching people on fire is terrible. I heard an explosion, I went into
the gas station and I started to take care of the injured people,"
Shimon Sebag, a witness, told public radio.
"I tried to put out the fire, even the moderately injured were on
fire," he said.
The restaurant's owner, Micki Matzah, told the radio: "I was close by
when I heard the explosion. There were body parts everywhere."
The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Islamic militant
group Hamas, claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing in a
telephone call to AFP.
It named the attacker as Shaadi Tubassi, 22, from the Jenin refugee
camp.
The blast came as Israel's security cabinet was meeting to discuss the
next phase in its large-scale military campaign to wipe out extremist
groups in the Palestinian territorie.
The army has besieged Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at his
headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah since Friday in revenge
for a suicide bombing Wednesday that left scores of Israelis dead.
"This is a new type of war for the 21st century, where human missiles
substitute for other missiles. We have to decide how best to deal with
this," said Israeli spokesman Raanan Gissin.
Four Palestinian suicide attacks, carried out by both nationalist and
Islamist radicals, haonvened by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
would take after pinning Arafat down in his Ramallah offices.
But Gissin told AFP: "Yasser Arafat could have caused much greater
damage if he had been free."
He said Israel would cooperate with whatever elements of the
Palestinian Authority were willing to work against anti-Israeli
militants. But he admitted that at present no figures had come forward
to offer their help.
"At this stage, there's no cooperation. But as things get worse, we
hope some figures will step forward."
