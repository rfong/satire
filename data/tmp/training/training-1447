The/DT French/JJ National/NNP Assembly/NNP was/VBD due/JJ to/TO give/VB a/DT second/JJ reading/NN to/TO the/DT so-called/JJ Debre/NNP bill/NN --/: named/VBN after/IN its/PRP$ author/NN Interior/NNP Minister/NNP Jean-Louis/NNP Debre/NNP --/: which/WDT bids/VBZ to/TO toughen/VB laws/NNS against/IN illegal/JJ aliens/NNS ./.

On/IN Tuesday/NNP Gaullist/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Alain/NNP Juppe/NNP pleaded/VBD with/IN left/NN and/CC right/NN ``/`` to/TO rally/VB around/RP the/DT heritage/NN of/IN the/DT Republic/NNP ,/, ''/'' saying/VBG that/DT by/IN ``/`` raising/VBG the/DT stakes/NNS ''/'' the/DT protestors/NNS were/VBD ``/`` playing/VBG into/IN the/DT hands/NNS of/IN those/DT who/WP accuse/VBP us/PRP of/IN laxism/NN and/CC impotence/NN ./.

The/DT prime/JJ minister/NN said/VBD that/IN according/VBG to/TO opinion/NN polls/NNS ,/, a/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT French/JJ approved/VBD the/DT bill/NN as/IN it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN amended/VBN ./.

The/DT government/NN has/VBZ already/RB climbed/VBN down/RP on/IN the/DT most/RBS controversial/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT Debre/NNP bill/NN ,/, softening/VBG a/DT clause/NN which/WDT would/MD oblige/VB private/JJ French/JJ citizens/NNS lodging/VBG immigrants/NNS who/WP need/VBP a/DT visa/NN to/TO enter/VB France/NNP to/TO report/VB their/PRP$ guests/NNS '/POS movements/NNS to/TO local/JJ authorities/NNS ./.

To/TO many/JJ the/DT clause/NN had/VBD seemed/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT throwback/NN to/TO occupied/JJ France/NNP in/IN World/NNP War/NNP II/NNP when/WRB people/NNS were/VBD encouraged/VBN to/TO inform/VB on/IN any/DT neighbors/NNS harbouring/VBG Jews/NNPS ./.

The/DT protest/NN caught/VBD the/DT opposition/NN Socialist/NNP Party/NNP on/IN the/DT wrong/JJ foot/NN ,/, with/IN leader/NN Lionel/NNP Jospin/NNP appearing/VBG to/TO hesitate/VB between/IN support/NN and/CC alienating/VBG the/DT anti-immigrant/JJ working/JJ class/NN vote/NN ./.

Commentators/NNS believe/VBP the/DT broad/JJ protest/NN movement/NN was/VBD sparked/VBN by/IN disgust/NN at/IN the/DT victory/NN of/IN the/DT National/NNP Front/NNP in/IN a/DT municipal/JJ by-election/NN in/IN the/DT southern/JJ town/NN of/IN Vitrolles/NNP on/IN February/NNP 9/CD ./.
