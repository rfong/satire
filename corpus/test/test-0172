Russia Looking More Like the Bear of Old 
The Russians are acting like Russians. Or is it Soviets? Tanks rolling
into Chechnya, a veto in the Security Council and grumbling about NATO
are stirring Cold War memories.
For the past five years the Russian bear was cuddly and cooperative.
Meetings between Boris Yeltsin and Presidents Bush and Clinton were
love feasts, complete with embraces, vows of friendship and
announcements of plans to end the Cold War nuclear standoff.
Less dependable lately, the bear is acting moody and dangerous,
particularly in matters involving its traditional turf. Not only is it
taking a tough stance in the historical Russian territory of Chechnya,
Russia wants its influence felt in what it calls the Near Abroad -- the
newly independent countries that formerly were a part of the old Soviet
Union.
Does that mean an inevitable break with the West?
``Russia can no more embrace the West fully than it can reject it
entirely,'' said Leon Aron, a Russian expert at the American Enterprise
Institute.
The Clinton administration is watching and hoping what it sees is
understandable Russian concern about matters close to its borders and
not an attempt to restore the old empire -- whether under Soviet
commissars or Russian tsars.
Clinton set the tone concerning U.S. reaction to Russian troops moving
into the rebellious province of Chechnya when he described it as
``largely an internal conflict that the Russians are dealing with.''
The president pointedly didn't rule out the possibility Russian
intervention would cost lives. ``We hope that order can be restored
with a minimum amount of bloodshed and violence,'' he said.
It seemed a long way from the bad old days when U.S. presidents loudly
condemned any Soviet action that led to bloodshed.
Russian rejection of NATO was another matter. But the reaction was more
sorrow than anger when Yeltsin asked why the West wanted to ``sow the
seeds of mistrust'' by expanding NATO eastward but stopping short of
including Russia.
``No major country is going to live by the laws of isolation,'' Yeltsin
told a meeting of the Council on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
``Any such country will reject such a game played with it.''
One could read a hint of menace in Yeltsin's tone. But Clinton, who was
in the audience, said he was ``disappointed,'' but ``these things are
to be expected in the relationships of great nations.''
The administration took a similar ``don't get excited'' view early this
month when Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at
cutting fuel supplies to the Bosnian Serbs.
There was no public administration criticism of the veto and one U.S.
official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said it was not a
surprise and not considered significant.
Not all analysts agree.
``For 10 years Russia did not cast a veto,'' said Paul Goble, a former
State Department official now at the Carnegie Institute.
``They're going to be nastier and less democratic, less liberal,'' he
said.
Aron believes, on the other hand, that it is alarmist to think Russia
is turning in an imperialist direction.
He said there is no doubt that Russia has moved away from the
``exuberant liberal internationalism'' that marked its foreign policy
in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
But, he said, ``There is no evidence Russia is engaged in a sustained
and well mapped out rebuilding of the empire.''
Mark Lowenthal, a foreign policy analyst at the Library of Congress,
said the administration ought to be happy that Yeltsin is asserting
himself on issues that quiet criticism from Russian nationalists while
continuing to cooperate with the West on issues like reducing nuclear
arsenals.
``I don't find the Russian veto in the U.N. or complaining about the
expansion of NATO all that surprising,'' said Lowenthal. As Chechnya,
he said, ``There's no way they can sit there and let this go. Nobody is
rooting for the total disintegration of Russia.'' ------
