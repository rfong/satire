British Prime Minister John Major to visit Hong Kong in March 
Prime Minister John Major is expected to visit Hong Kong early next
month, British government sources said here Monday.
Major was expected in Hong Kong after attending the two-day Asia-Europe
summit in Bangkok March 1 and 2, the sources said, but added that the
visit "has yet to be formally announced."
He will also visit South Korea on March 4 and 5 for talks with
President Kim Young-Sam, British embassy officials said in Seoul.
Major's visit to Hong Kong is designed to be a morale-boosting one in
the run-up to China's takeover of the territory next year, amid growing
signs of public unease.
The sources said Major's visit would reflect support for Hong Kong
Governor Chris Patten and his democratic reform policies which have
angered Beijing. China has vowed to dismantle Hong Kong's
democratically-elected legislature after the handover on July 1, 1997.
Patten has also warned recently of the dangers of a mass exodus before
the handover if China fails to guarantee the legislature's
impartiality.
The sources also said Major was expected to meet either Chinese
President Jiang Zemin or Premier Li Peng at the summit in Bangkok.
China has yet to announce which of its two leaders will attend.
The summit will bring together heads of state and government of the
15-nation European Union with leaders of the seven-member Association
of South East Asian Nations (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) as well as China, Japan and South
Korea.
Sources said Major was expected to convey to Chinese leaders British
concerns over preparations for the 1997 sovereignty transfer and
China's dismissive attitude towards Patten.
Britain and China are still at loggerheads on several major issues
linked to the handover, including the definition of who will be
eligible as permanent residents of Hong Kong after 1997.
