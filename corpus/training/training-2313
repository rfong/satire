Iranian FM Velayati visits Turkey in bid to mend ties 
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati arrived here Monday as part
of efforts to mend recently strained ties between the two neighbours.
"Both countries are determined to overcome this crisis," Velayati told
reporters upon his arrival in Ankara. "The first step was made by
(Turkish President Suleyman) Demirel. My visit constitutes the second
political step."
He said he planned to meet with Demirel as well as Islamist premier
Necmettin Erbakan and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.
"We think this crisis can be overcome thanks to the willingness on both
sides," he said, adding that he planned to extend an official
invitation to Demirel to attend the Organisation of Islamic Conference
(OIC) summit to be held in Tehran later this year.
Turkish-Iranian ties suffered in February following a speech by Iran's
ambassador in Ankara, Mohammad Bagheri, at a controversial rally in an
Ankara suburb where he expressed support for efforts to bring sharia
(Islamic law) to Turkey.
Turkey asked Iran to withdraw Bagheri and another Iranian diplomat in
Istanbul, who publicly said he detested Turkey's secular regime.
Iran retaliated by asking Turkey to pull back its ambassador in Tehran
and another diplomat in the western town of Orumieh.
Iran's consul general in the eastern town of Erzurum then added further
fuel to the fire, denouncing the Turkish military for its moves against
radical Turkish Islamists. Ankara declared him persona non grata in
late February.
Erbakan has sought to boost political and economic ties with Iran's
Islamic fundamentalist administration at the expense of angering
Ankara's closest western ally, the United States. Washington considers
Iran as a main supporter of terrorism.
Erbakan's aides signed a multi-billion dollar agreement agreement for
Iranian natural gas for Turkey during a visit by the Turkish premier to
Tehran in last August.
