Afghan interim leader urges commission to act impartially
Interim leader Hamid Karzai on Thursday called for impartiality from a
commission tasked with organising a council of tribal elders to choose
Afghanistan's next transitional government.
"I assure you that we will not interfere in your work," Karzai said at
a ceremony here to officially inaugurate the 21-member commission.
The commission is tasked with organising a Loya Jirga, a traditional
council of elders, to select a new government in June when the current
administration's mandate expires.
Under a UN-backed inter-Afghan accord reached in December, the
government will rule the war-ravaged country for 18 months or until
democratic elections are held.
Karzai promised that his administration would help the commission
without interfering.
"You will be completely free and independent to prepare freedom and
peace for Afghanistan and its people, to prepare a Loya Jirga which
will be fully representative of the people," Karzai said.
The commission was named by Karzai on January 25 and met for the first
time on January 30 in Kabul.
"You must go everywhere to meet the people, talk with them and seek out
their true representatives," Karzai said.
The commission "should act with courage, should not be pressured or
influenced by the force of guns, and should ensure that the common
Afghan will be represented in the Loya Jirga," he said
"If they face difficulty in this regard, anywhere in Afghanistan, they
must complain to the United Nations.
"If0u f UN cannot do anything, do come to us. We stand by you. With
every means that we have, we will help to hold a Loya Jirga that is
free, independent and representative of the Afghan people," he said.
Karzai insisted his administration would not stand in the commission's
way.
"We shall not interfere in your work. We will stay apart, and we will
make sure to help you."
The commission has five months to convene the Loya Jirga.
At its first meeting last week, three committees were appointed to
determine the operation of the Loya Jirga, find qualified people to
join it and establish liaison with the Afghan people.
The commission and the Loya Jirga are part of the provisions of the
December 5 Bonn accord, which paved the way for the formation of
Karzai's six-month administration that took office in Kabul on December
22.
Commission chairman Ismail Qasimyar, an expert in constitutional law,
said members would canvass the country and draw Loya Jirga members from
each sector of society. The assembly would number about 500, he said.
Representatives from local areas will be chosen by their shura, or
tribal council, while special interests groups such as the civil
service, women, the media, arts and sports people will select delegates
from criteria to be drawn up soon.
Qasimya said the commission would meet weekly and make decisions on a
"collective" basis.
