Bush Hopes Recession Doesn't Affect Sales Of His Memoirs
President George W. Bush told reporters Monday that he remains optimistic
that the impending recession will end before his memoirs go on sale. "With
any luck, we can pull together as a nation and get through this thing
before Dec. 15, 2010," said Bush, referring to the tentative release date
of his autobiography, Born Leading. "It would be a terrible tragedy if this
massive economic downturn left the average American family unable to afford
the $39.95 plus tax they need to buy my book." Bush added that he is
currently considering an exclusive straight- to-paperback deal with
Wal-Mart to make his memoirs less costly should the country slide into a
crippling economic depression.
