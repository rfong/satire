Australian Stocks Continue Falling 
The Australian stock market continued to lose its ground today because
of the combined effects of inflation data released today and softer
gold index.
The leading market indicator, the all ordinaries index, closed at
2,235.7 points, slumping by 10.9 points from Tuesday's finish of
2,246.6 points.
Inflation data and the weakening gold sector were regarded as factors
contributing to the fall in the local bourse.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics released that the country's
consumer price index rose 0.8 percent in the December quarter, bringing
the annual inflation rate to 5.1 percent in the 12 months to December.
And the gold index in the local market shed by 36 points to end at
2,127.6 points.
The all industrials index also dipped sharply by 13.5 points to close
at 3,366.4 points from 3,379.9 points Tuesday.
The all resources index lost 9.1 points to 1,380.7 points from the
previous finish of 1,389.8 points.
The national turnover reached 228.25 million shares, with a value worth
489.97 million Australian dollars (360.13 million US dollars).
