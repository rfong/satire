Paris Bourse suffers modest loss in light trading 
The Paris Bourse, one of the few European stock markets to make an
effort on Tuesday, suffered a modest loss in very quiet trading the day
after Christmas, as operators said the traditional "confectioners'
truce" was respected.
The CAC 40 index was down by 0.48 percent at the opening on Tuesday and
finished with a loss of 0.36 percent to stand at 1,866.67 points. Share
volume was only around 2.2 billion francs.
Trading was marked by some profit-taking, operators said. Big losers
included Gascogne, down 4.4 percent on the day, UIC 3.9, and EuraFrance
3.8 percent. Intertechnique jumped 9.2 percent, UGC DA 8 percent, and
Remy-Cointreau 6.4 percent.
London and most other European markets were closed.
