Greece Sees Macedonia's Ceasefire as Fragile 
Greece on Monday described as fragile the cease-fire in Macedonia and
hoped that the dialogue between political forces in the neighboring
country will start soon.
Speaking at a press briefing, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
that the cease-fire in the Balkan neighbor was fragile.
The dialogue between the political forces in Macedonia must open and be
completed as soon as possible, he added.
Reppas noted that the Greek government is constantly keeping informed
on the developments in Macedonia.
As for Saturday night's attack targeting the Greek embassy press office
in Skopje, he said the Greek government has requested Skopje to take
all necessary protection measures.
As Macedonia's neighbor, Greece has done its best to help defuse the
crisis in the neighboring country.
Greece has repeated its willingness to send troops as part of NATO
peacekeeping force in Macedonia, and 350 Greek army officers have
reportedly completed their preparations at the 525 mechanized battalion
in northern Greece.
