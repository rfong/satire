China Cracks Down on Shoddy, Fake, Sometimes Dangerous Products 
The markets these days are overflowing with far more products than most
Chinese ever dreamed of. They're also booby-trapped with products that
not only fail to do what they claim, but are sometimes fatal.
As the economy has grown, quality control has declined.
Zhou Sujun learned that lesson when a soft drink bottle blew up in her
face, blinding her in one eye.
The 19-year-old's misfortune is not unusual: official reports say that
some 300 people have complained of having been injured by exploding
bottles in the past year. And that's just one of the product problems
afflicting the Chinese.
Televisions, water heaters and even oxygen tanks occasionally
self-destruct, causing dozens of deaths and injuries. Seeds that don't
sprout, poisonous fake medicines and liquors, fake spices and
ineffective contraceptives also have infiltrated the markets.
``The sacrifice of quality for speed, violation of standard operating
procedures for faster completion of projects and disregard for business
ethics for greater profits are frequent phenomena,'' complained an
editorial in a recent issue of the newspaper Liberation Daily.
One of the side effects of China's industrial boom of the past decade
has been a proliferation of tiny factories that don't meet quality
standards. Some copy the packaging of brand-name or foreign products.
As part of the country's drive to reform its economy and legal system,
laws were enacted last year that prohibit counterfeit and unsafe goods.
Violators face fines, jail sentences, sometimes execution.
But by all accounts, the problem has grown worse.
In late September, authorities in the northeastern city of Shenyang
raided a market in the surburbs and confiscated counterfeit cigarettes,
alcohol, health products, oil and electronics.
The newspaper Guangming Daily reported that Shenyang officials had
handled 1,750 cases involving counterfeit goods between January and
March -- a 97 percent increase over same period in 1993.
Alarmed by such trends, the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress sent work teams to five provinces this autumn to inspect the
enforcement of the new laws and to punish violations ``without mercy.''
Bad seeds, pesticides and fertilizer can mean calamity for farmers
living on the edge of subsistence.
The problem stretches from barrooms serving lethal moonshine all the
way into the bedroom, where Chinese couples have discovered that the
supposedly superior ``foreign-made'' condoms they had splurged on were
poor quality fakes.
Such surprises are unwelcome anywhere, but especially so in China,
where unplanned pregnancies are not allowed.
China's quality problems are not unique. In the 1950s, Japan also
embarked on a major quality improvement campaign inspired by the U.S.
industrial expert W. Edwards Deming. Workers and managers organized
into ``quality circles'' helped make Japan an export superpower.
In 1991, China began offering certificates for export, and preferential
licensing and customs procedures, to factories that passed inspections
for international standards.
Goods produced for export generally do pass muster. But the same cannot
be said of many of the goods made for sale at home.
Even in Shanghai, China's top industrial city, only three-quarters of
the products inspected in 1993 met the international standards,
although almost all goods produced for export did.
That's still above the national average of 66 percent. One inspection
sample discovered that only 7.7 percent of anti-explosion devices for
mines were up to standard, and none of the electronic instruments were.
Beginning in September, all electric products sold in China were
required to bear safety inspection stickers to comply with the product
safety laws passed last year. But there are only 17,000 inspectors.
Weak law enforcement and corruption in local areas also are to blame,
officials said.
Until recently, consumer protection in China has been minimal. But
buyers increasingly are taking their cases to court.
Zhou, the victim of the exploding bottle, settled for dlrs 3,000 in
compensation, the newspaper China Daily reported recently.
In many cases, however, delays in the legal process just mean further
hardship for the victims of fake or poor quality goods.
No day in court can compensate soldier Zhang Guobing and his friends.
Zhang bought what was labelled as a ``famous wine'' to give to his
buddies. One died and two were blinded by the liquid.
