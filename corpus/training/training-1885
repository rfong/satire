Algerian president requests meeting with Chirac 
Algerian President Liamine Zeroual is seeking a meeting with French
President Jacques Chirac in New York next month, French officials said
Tuesday.
An official at Chriac's Elysee Palace confirmed the request when asked
about Arab-language media reports of a possible meeting between the two
men in the sidelines of ceremonies marking the 50th annivesary of the
United Nations on October 22-23.
"It is true to say that the Algerian president, among other heads of
state, has requested a meeting with Mr. Chirac," the official said.
"This request is currently being considered, and we will reply," he
added.
He added that Chirac has "reserved his response" over the request,
highly sensitive at a time when France is on alert for a wave of
terrorist attacks believed to be linked to the civil war in its former
north African colony.
Algerian Islamic fundamentalist militants are suspected to be behind
the terrorist violence in France, which they accuse of supporting the
Algiers regime they are battling.
