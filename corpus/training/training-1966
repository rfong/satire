Tyson May be Barred from Entering Britain 
American boxer Mike Tyson could face an entry ban to Britain for a bout
next week because of his criminal record, the Home Office said on
Tuesday, according to a Reuters report.
Tyson is due to arrive in London within the next week to begin training
but the Home Office said it was still considering the issue.
"On the understanding that he will enter in the next couple of weeks we
are considering his right to enter," a Home Office spokesman said.
"The rules state that entry is normally refused, save where there are
strong compassionate reasons, if an offence was committed which would
be punishable in the UK with imprisonment of 12 months or more," he
said.
The Home Office stance was reinforced by Prime Minister Tony Blair's
spokesman who told reporters: "As I understand it, the room for
discretion is very, very limited."
Tyson was convicted of rape in the United States in 1992 and sentenced
to six years in jail. He then served another term for an attack on two
middle-aged motorists, from which he was freed only eight months ago.
