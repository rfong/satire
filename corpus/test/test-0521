Zimbabwe's Difficult Economy Affects Investment: World Bank 
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of
the World Bank, Monday said the difficult economic condition in
Zimbabwe has affected its ability to fund projects there.
Existing projects, even those of exporters, have difficulties in
repayments because of the exchange rate which has been fixed for a long
time, said IFC senior investment officer Musonda Chipalo here in
Harare.
He said the IFC had by June this year approved funding of only one
small hotel project worth 300,000 U.S. dollars.
"For people to invest, they must be sure they will make a profit. If
they don't have any confidence in the economy they won' t invest," he
said.
The official, however, said the IFC would try to continue doing
business in Zimbabwe provided the projects are viable and not affected
by the macro-economic situation in the country.
Meanwhile, IFC regional representative Mike Tiller said Zimbabwe's
recovery needs deliberate decisions at the macro- economic level.
He said the biggest problem for businesses in the country is the budget
deficit being run by the government, which forces it to borrow on the
domestic market, crowding out the private sector.
The IFC has been active in Zimbabwe since 1980 and has made more than
50 investments in the private sector worth more than 350 million
dollars.
The corporation was established in 1956 to encourage private sector
activity in developing countries.
