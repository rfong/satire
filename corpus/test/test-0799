Groups urge UN rights forum to back tough stand against Russia 
Human rights groups on Monday stepped up pressure on the UN Human
Rights Commission to condemn Russian violations in Chechnya, citing the
disappearance of Chechens in Russian custody.
The 53-member Commission is due to vote on Friday on a draft resolution
presented by the European Union which Western diplomats say Russia is
strongly contesting.
The text "strongly condemns" forced disappearances, extrajudicial
executions, torture, ill-treatment, "as well as indiscriminate use of
military force by the Russian security forces and army, including
against civilians", according to a copy released by the UN.
US-based human rights group Human Rights Watch and Russian counterpart
Memorial issued a report detailing 87 cases of disappearances.
They estimate that several thousand Chechens have disappeared during
the resurgence of the conflict since the separatist republic tried to
break away from Russia in October 1999.
"During the second war in Chechnya, so far about 2000, that's about as
much as in the first -- almost all of them after arrest by federal
(Russian) forces," Alexander Cherkasov of Memorial told journalists.
Of the 87 cases examined in depth, 25 corpses were found, raising fears
about summary executions, according to HRW.
"There is no real accountability on disappearances in Chechnya,"
Elizabeth Andersen of HRW said.
HRW acknowledged Russian efforts to investigate, but said they were
largely ineffective and most abuses remained uninvestigated and
unpunished.
"There is also credible evidence that the military obstructs
investigations, notably by transferring accused security and law
enforcement personnel to avoid having them questioned," HRW said in a
statement.
"The UN Commission must acknowledge this and press Russia to invite UN
monitors to investigate," Andersen added.
The draft resolution urges Russia to allow UN special rapporteurs on
extrajudicial executions and torture to visit Chechnya.
Russia has rejected resolutions passed by the Commission over the last
two years, and this year's draft also "deplores...its failure to
comply".
It also repeats calls for Russia to set up a national commission to
investigate human rights violations in Chechnya, andLu2ges Moscow to
ensure that an order by a local army commander last month to clean up
special sweep operations is followed.
The draft resolution also strongly condemns all terrorist attacks, "as
well as violations of humanitarian law perpetrated by Chechen fighters,
such as hostage-taking, torture and the indiscriminate use of
landmines, booby-traps and other explosive devices aimed at causing
widespread civilian casualties".
Russian officials said last month that 33 Russian troops, including
four officers, have been convicted over crimes committed against
Chechen civilians.
A total of 132 criminal investigations had been opened, and cases
involving 62 soldiers have been sent to trial, they added.
EU and Russian officials were negotiating here to find a text the
Russians could agree to, diplomats said.
