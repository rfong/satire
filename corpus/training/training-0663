Feature: For Tokyo And Beijing, Kids' Smiles Are Signs of the Future (3)
This is the Japanese kids' first visit to Beijing. Their parents sent
them off with the usual stuff about safety and strangers, and reminded
them to bring home souvenirs -- comments that the Japanese boys now
mimic with wicked precision.
"Safety is no problem," said Susumu Shimazaki who has been to China
three times. "The public order of Beijing is sound, and the roads are
clean. We can watch TV programs of NHK (Japanese television station) in
our hotel. Life here is not much different from in Tokyo."
Besides baseball matches, boys also shopped around in Beijing and
visited the Great Wall and the Summer Palace.
