Pakistani leader ready "unconditionally" to meet Indian 
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said on Monday he was prepared
"unconditionally" to hold talks on the Kashmir crisis with Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee during a regional summit on security in
the Kazakh economic capital Almaty.
"I don't have any conditions (for a meeting). You need to ask this
question to Vajpayee," Musharraf told a news conference after a meeting
with Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
Indian Deputy Foreign Minister Omar Abdullah earlier reiterated New
Delhi's position that direct talks with Pakistan would not take place
unless there were clear signs of a rePu#uion in the number of militants
crossing into Indian-administered Kashmir.
Questioned on the prospects of avoiding war between the two
nuclear-armed rivals, Musharraf replied:
"I will do my utmost. I hope I will be successful. They say you can't
clap with one hand, you clap with two hands, but the second has to be
equally supportive in avoiding war. That is how we will succeed in
avoiding war.
The Pakistani leader said Nazarbayev had told him he had been unable to
obtain an assurance from Vajpayee during a separate meeting that the
Indian premier would agree to speak to him.
On the prospects for Russian mediation, Musharraf said President
Vladimir Putin, who was due to arrive in Almaty later on Monday, was
"in a very important position to play a definitive role in mediation
between India and Pakistan".
Musharraf and Vajpayee are in Almaty to attend a one-day Conference on
Interaction and Confidence-building measures in Asia (CICA) on Tuesday.
The conference has been totally overshadowed by the crisis in Kashmir,
which is divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both.
