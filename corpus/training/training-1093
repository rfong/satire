But the key role will be for Lee, Gascoigne's replacement for the last
15 minutes at Wembley last month, and Redknapp, who must provide the
inspiration and the perspiration in midfield.
Lee, the 29-year-old former Charlton midfielder, is filling the role
normally assumed by David Platt, just as he did on his debut against
Romania a year ago when he scored just before half-time.
He was injured after his second cap against Nigeria but now has a
chance to book his Euro invitation.
