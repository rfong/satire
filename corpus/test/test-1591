Asian stocks stronger on positive tech news 
Asian stock markets made good gains Wednesday after bullish comments
from US computer network giant Cisco Systems Inc.
Tokyo stocks rose 1.8 percent, supported by short-covering in
technology stocks and a weaker yen, dealers said.
The sharp rally in Cisco's shares in after-hours trade after the US
company released better-than-expected third quarter results also lent
some support to the market, dealers said.
The Nikkei-225 average of the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at 11,520.75
points, up 204.71 from Tuesday's close, while the Topix index of all
first section issues ended up 7.64 points at 1,081.76.
"We get the normal yo-yoing of the market. Sometimes it yo-yos for one
reason, then for another," said Jean-Pascal Rolandez, strategist at BNP
Paribas, adding that shares benefited from short-covering after
Tuesday's two percent fall.
"The market's up 10 percent and the US is down 10 percent. People have
realised that the outlooks for (Japanese) companies are not that bad,"
Rolandez said.
"Some wonder whether it's too good to be true... but as companies
continue to release orders, people are saying 'so far, so good'," he
added.
"The yen situation seems to reflect, for once, the fundamentals of the
economy. It has always had a prevalent influence on exporters but the
(order) volume effect is far more important."
HONG KONG: Hong Kong share prices dropped 0.2 percent on profit-taking
led by the property sector, with some minor fund-switching into other
regional markets also weighing on the Hang Seng index.
The Hang Seng lost 27.67 points to close at 11,768.31.
Dealers, however, said underlying sentiment remained positive, with
gains in stocks including HSBC offsetting some of the losses.
Steven Leung, sales director at DBS Vickers, said the major feature of
day was profit-taking in property stocks after the strong performance
of the sector over recent sessions.
However he noted interest remained firm in other blue chip counters
including HSBC.
SYDNEY: Australian shares prices rose by almost half a percent, buoyed
by a healthy outlook for the domestic economy and rises in overseas
markets.
The benchmark SP/ASX 200 index closed 14.9 points up at 3,339.9, while
the All Ordinaries index rose 13.7 points to 3,287.4.
Ausbil Dexia chief investment officer Michael Wilson said the Reserve
Bank's announcement of a quarter percentage point rate rise had been
expected, but its accompanying upbeat statement on the economy had
helped boost the market with larger stocks bouncing back.
"A relief recovery on the back of better overnight markets (overseas)
saw stocks that had been heavily sold off start to recover," he added.
SINGAPORE: Singapore share prices closed 0.8 percent higher, brushing
aside Wall Street's mixed ending.
The Straits Times Index (STI) rose 14.45 points to 1,735.43. In the
broader market, the All-Singapore Equities index rose 3.34 points to
end at 457.41.
Dealers said last-minute buying of blue chip stocks lifted the STI
higher but pointed out sentiment, both locally and regionally, remained
weak amid worries about the pace of the US economic recovery.
"Most of Asia seemed very cautious and maybe they wanted to see more
evidence from the US particularly, of recovery signs," a dealer with a
local brokerage said.
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed 0.6 percent higher due to a
technical rebound in select blue chips and speculative buying.
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.54 points to
finish at 794.47.
"I think investors took the cue from Wall Street," said an
institutional dealer with a local brokerage.
Another dealer said the rebound was partly technical, aided by foreign
buying of blue chips and stocks of Renong group in anticipation of more
corporate developments ahead of the the impending listing of its
highway operator unit PLUS.
