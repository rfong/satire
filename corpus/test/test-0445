British Diplomat on Contingency Plan for Cyprus 
British High Commissioner to Cyprus David Madden said here Monday that
there is no travel advice to British tourists against visiting this
Eastern Mediterranean island.
His words came following a reported British "contingency plan" to
airlift 250,000 people from Cyprus on fears over war if Cypriot
government go on with its plan to deploy Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles later this year.
Speaking after an hour-long meeting with Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides, Madden disassociated efforts to settle the
protracted Cyprus problem with a Cypriot government decision to deploy
the defensive S-300 missile system.
He reiterated British disagreement with the missile deployment, but
said Britain will continue its efforts for a political settlement in
Cyprus.
Referring to the report by "Sunday Times," Madden said that
"contingency planning is one thing, risk assessment is another."
Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said Monday in a
written statement that leaking of information by the British Defense
Ministry over plans in the event of crisis in Cyprus does not
contribute to good bilateral relations.
He said that Cypriot government decision to deploy the anti-aircraft
S-300 missiles, which pose a challenge to the rival Turkish Cypriots
and Turkey, would not change.
Cypriot government ordered the missile system from Russia in January
1997, which is expected to be delivered in mid-August. The deal was
opposed by the U.S., Britain and some others. Turkey has threatened to
destroy the missiles if deployed on the island.
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its troops
and took over the northern third in the aftermath of a pro-Athens coup
in Nicosia.
Turkey has kept around 40,000 troops in northern Cyprus, which was
declared unilaterally in 1983 by Turkish Cypriots as a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only by Ankara.
