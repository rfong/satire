King arrives for first official visit to Israel 
King Hussein of Jordan arrived for his first official visit to Israel
on Thursday to exchange ratified peace treaties with Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
The king, only the second Arab head of state to visit Israel after
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1979, shook hands warmly with Rabin
after arriving by Super Puma helicopter on the shores of the Sea of
Galilee.
Some 500 policemen and hundreds of soldiers were deployed near the
lakeside Beit Gabriel conference center where the two leaders were to
exchange the peace documents.
Regular traffic was diverted away from the area.
Hundreds of children waved Israeli and Jordanian flags to welcome the
king, accompanied by Crown Prince Hassan Ibn Talal and Prime Minister
Abdel Salam Majali.
The peace treaty was signed October 26 on the border between the two
countries near the Red Sea.
