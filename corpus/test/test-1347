Heavy sentences for seven youths who raped Austrian tourist in London 
Seven youths who viciously gang-raped an Austrian tourist before
hurling her naked into a canal to swim for her life were sentenced to a
total of 77 years detention, by a London court Friday.
The court sentenced five teenagers to 11 years, one to 10 years and
another to 12 years.
The youths were aged between 14 and 17 when they "violently and
repeatedly" raped the 32-year-old tourist and mother of two, who cannot
be named for legal reasons, while she was on holiday in London.
She was kicked, punched, and subjected to a multiple rape ordeal and
other "sexual indignities" during an hour-long ordeal after going for a
midnight stroll from her hotel in King's Cross, in the north of London.
None of the boys showed any emotion as the sentence was passed, but
there were sobs from the public gallery which was packed with members
of their families.
Those who can now be named are Filipino-born brothers Eduardo Agum, 16,
and Allan Agum, 15, of Clapton Square, Hackney, east London; Cesar
Cardenas, 15, of Holsworthy Square, Elm Street, Clerkenwell and
Nicholas Mavrides, 16, of Rowstock Gardens, Camden, north London.
An eighth member of the gang -- the 14-year-old, 6ft 2in tall
"ringleader" -- was not before the court Friday. The boy, who cannot be
named, is to be sentenced later once reports on him are completed.
Seven of the eight pleaded guilty to rape.
The victim was not in court, but her husband sat in the public gallery.
