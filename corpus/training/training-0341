Worldwide Semiconductor Market to Grow: Study 
The worldwide semiconductor market will grow almost 12 percent in 1999,
following a 6 percent decline this year, according to a study released
Monday.
In its study, Dataquest, a California-based leader in the market
intelligence industry, picked out dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
because of the strong effect of its market volatility. The company made
forecasts of the semiconductor market with and without DRAM.
With DRAM, worldwide semiconductor revenue will reach 155 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999. Excluding DRAM, the revenue is expected to reach 124
billion dollars in the same year, up 9.7 percent over the 1998 revenue.
Although the microprocessor market should rebound in some regions
during the fourth quarter this year, Dataquest said, the global impact
of weak Asian economies means key semiconductor markets will likely not
strengthen until the middle of 1999.
The semiconductor market will continue to confront oversupply,
Dataquest said. The foundry oversupply will persist for the next 18
months, while the DRAM oversupply will last until mid- or late 2000,
according to the study.
Europe is the only region Dataquest projected to maintain positive
growth in 1998. The region's semiconductor market is forecast to grow
1.4 percent this year. Japan is expected to decline 15.8 percent in
1998, while the Americas is forecast to drop 4.7 percent, and
Asia-Pacific will decline 3.5 percent.
Dataquest analysts said that under current economic conditions, demand
throughout Asia, including Japan, for semiconductor-based products will
remain sluggish at best.
