Dollar falls as Middle East fears grow 
The dollar fell against the yen Monday on concerns over continuing
violence in the Middle East as well as fears about weak US share
prices, dealers said.
The greenback traded at 131.44 yen at 11:37 am (0237 GMT) down from
131.65-70 yen in New York and 132.01-03 yen in Tokyo late Friday.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is visiting the Middle East this
week.
"The market is looking at Powell's visit to Israel but it's difficult
to see what the change in this matter will be," said Koji Fukaya, chief
foreign exchange analyst for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
"It's difficult to see a change this week so the stockmarket may be
stagnant in the US which may push the dollar on the weaker side."
The Israeli army has continued its incursions into Palestinian land
despite calls from US President George W. Bush for a withdrawal.
Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer noted the president had
demanded Israel "make progress" on pulling its troops out, rather than
immediately withdrawing the army.
The Japanese stockmarket remained firm, despite losses seen in US
technology stocks Friday, analysts said.
The tech-weighted Nasdaq index ended last week down 19.72 points to
1,770.03.
But Japan's economic fundamentals remained weak, reducing the chance of
any sharp downward movement in the dollar, said Fukaya.
"There is no reason to buy the yen," he said, adding the Ministry of
Finance would watch carefully any movement by the dollar towards the
130 yen, despite recent remarks that they were unconcerned.
Finance Ministry director-general Zenbei Mizoguchi said earlier the
dollar/yen should move calmly, "but I have no special comment to add on
the present levels."
Supply and demand for the dollar in the short-term remained slightly
weak after recent expectations were dashed that Japanese institutions
would invest overseas at the start of the new fiscal year on April 1.
These investors will likely wait until after the long "Golden Week"
holiday at the start of May before making foreign asset allocations,
while exporters were ready to sell the dollar immediately at higher
levels, said Fukuya.
"Exporters are concerned with hedging (their overseas receipts) and
they usually hedge before the long holidays, so the demand and supply
situation is not so good for the dollar," he said.
Machinery orders data due out later in the day may give some indication
of the strength of any expected rebound in Japanese production,
although many economists expect the recovery to be weak.
"Clearly Japan's industrial production has begun to rebound but I think
it's not so strong because the export rebound is not so rapid ... the
domestic rebound is weak, along with capital investment," Fukaya said.
Meanwhile, the euro bought 0.8781 dollars, against 0.8790-92 dollars in
New York and 0.878nd 116.00 yen in Tokyo Friday afternoon.
