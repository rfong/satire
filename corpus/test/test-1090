Mahathir vows action against corporate 'cronies' 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has warned government
"cronies" that misappropriation or mismanagement of funds by anyone
would not be tolerated.
The premier was speaking at a dialogue Sunday with Malaysian students
in London, where he is on a five-day working visit, the official
Bernama news agency reported.
He was asked about allegations of misappropriation and mismanagement of
funds in loss-making Malaysia Airlines and national steel firm Perwaja.
The flag carrier last week sought police help to probe alleged
management irregularities by its former chairman Tajudin Ramli, who is
a close associate of ex-finance minister Daim Zainuddin.
Perwaja Thursday shut down its two manufacturing plants for a month to
restructure its business.
The company, which has accumulated losses and liabilities estimated by
industry officials at 10.7 billion ringgit (2.8 billion dollars), has
been under investigation for alleged abuse of funds since 1996.
In the case of Malaysia Airlines which was renationalised early last
year, Mahathir said the new management had discovered certain
misappropriations of funds that were not sanctioned by the board.
"The case has already been reported to the police," he said.
"Even though the previous owner was probably a crony of the government,
this does not prevent us from taking actions against the people who
have misappropriated funds," he added.
But the premier noted the airline's financial woes were partly due to
the September 11 terror attacks in the United States.
"All airlines will lose money if they could only fill less then 35
percent of seats and people are reluctant to travel," he said.
"So, it is not just bad management but also external environment that
can affect a company."
In Perwaja's case, the premier said a certain businessman was believed
to have transferred money into Swiss accounts and the unwillingness of
the Swiss to cooperate and give evidence in Malaysian courts had
hampered investigations.
"It is believed that he has mismanaged and taken money from the
company. We have already investigated. Unfortunately, the money which
was supposed to have been siphoned out is not easily located," he said.
"We are still continuing with investigations and if there are evidence,
we will bring the person to court and he will have to face the
consequences."
Analysts and business leaders said Malaysia's clean-up of some of its
most heavily-indebted but well-connected corporations has raised hopes
of greater transparency in the business sector.
