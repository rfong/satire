Takashimaya profit soars 69 percent 
Japanese department store operator Takashimaya Co. Ltd. Friday said its
consolidated pre-tax profit jumped 69 percent from a year earlier to
21.5 billion yen (178 million dollars) in the year to February.
The company said group sales grew three percent to 1,240 billion yen in
the same period, forecasting a higher profit of 22.1 billion yen for
the current year on increased sales of 1,290 billion yen.
Takashimaya maintained sales growth at most divisions, with
particularly strong sales at its new Tokyo store in Shinjuku, which
opened in October.
President Tatsuro Tanaka said the outlet's sales were 41.3 billion yen
between October and February, surpassing the 35 billion yen projected.
The forecast for full-year sales has since been raised from 80 billion
yen to 87.7 billion yen.
Takashimaya said it also benefitted from a sharp rise in consumer
demand ahead of a consumption tax hike on April 1.
"Although we expected a 1.5 percent fall in April sales ... sales in
March were stronger than expected," Tanaka said, adding they exceeded
expectations by 20 billion yen.
He also said lower sales in April "cannot be avoided" but added growth
in retail revenues would be flat this year.
"The consumer spending environment is not good at all," Tanaka said.
During the latest year, Takashimaya saw increased sales of clothing,
personal belongings, food and sundry goods. Restaurant and coffee shop
revenues were also higher.
But sales of household products declined due to sluggish sales of home
interior products, which Tanaka decsribed as "an industry-wide trend."
