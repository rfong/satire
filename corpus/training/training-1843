British customs seize drugs worth 17.5 million dollars in one haul 
British customs officers seized here Saturday a consignment of various
drugs with an estimated street value of 11 million pounds (17.5 million
dollars).
The huge haul was the largest of a number of seizures made at Dover
over the weekend worth in total 13 million pounds.
A Customs and Excise spokesman described the haul as a "half-ton lethal
cocktail" of 12 kilos (26 pounds) of cocaine, 80 kilos of the synthetic
drug ecstasy, 90 kilos of amphetamines and 390 kilos of cannabis.
The drugs were found hidden in a refrigerator truck driven by Belgian
Franck Smets, 29, who apparently had made a detour via Britain to
deliver the consignment before dropping off his regular load in the
Netherlands.
"This is a major success for Customs and Excise thanks to the vigilance
of our uniform staff at Dover," a spokesman said. "It clearly
demonstrates the extent of which criminal organisations are
diversifying in order to cater for the different drugs markets in the
UK."
