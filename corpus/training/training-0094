Rebel Serbs moved closer toward normalizing ties with Croatia late
Thursday, approving an economic agreement despite reported artillery
duels between the two sides.
The self-styled Croatian Serb assembly, meeting behind closed doors for
nearly eight hours, approved the accord shortly before midnight.
The agreement calls for restoring water and electricity supplies and
reopening oil pipelines and the highway linking Zagreb, the Croatian
capital, and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade. Two sections of the
360-kilometer (220 mile) highway are controlled by Croatian Serbs.
It is the first accord between the foes since they agreed March 29 on a
formal cease-fire to end their six-month war in 1991.
