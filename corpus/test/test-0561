48 Somalis fined for illegal entry into Kenya 
A Nairobi court on Friday fined 48 Somali nationals 5,000 Kenyan
shillings (63 dollars or 68 euros) each after they were arrested on
Wednesday for entering Kenya illegally.
The 48, most of them womenp6f6dmpanied by small children, pleaded
guilty to entering the country without the proper documents.
They were detained by immigration officials on Wednesday after they
boarded a charter plane at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International
Airport (JKIA) to return to Somalia.
Their lawyer, Steve Owino, told the court they were trying to leave as
their applications for refugee status in Kenya had been turned down and
they wanted to escape the ongoing crackdown by Kenyan security forces
on illegal aliens.
"We in Kenya cannot appreciate the ravages of war. These people came
into Kenya to apply for refugee status at the UN refugees agency, as
there is no such office in Somalia," Owino told Olawo.
He said "well-wishers of the accused raised funds for air tickets to
enable them fly back to Somalia, at least to one of the peaceful
locations, after their applications to the refugees agency were
rejected."
Last week, security forces rounded up 21 Somali nationals who were
dropped in eastern Kenya by a charter plane.
Nine of them have been convicted in the eastern town of Machakos for
illegally entering Kenya and sentenced to a fine of 60,000 Kenyan
shillings or six months in jail.
Most of them are reported to be languishing in jail, unable to pay the
fine.
