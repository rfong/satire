DAB Bank, the online brokerage arm of HypoVereinsbank, said Tuesday it
slid further into the red last year as a result of heavy goodwill
writedowns against its French unit Selftrade.
DAB Bank said in a st0eRdnt its net loss widened to 196.02 million
euros (173 million dollars) last year from a loss of 3.84 million euros

pre-tax loss of 64.41 million euros in 2000.
"In addition to the downturn in the stock markets, earnings were hit by
one-items, such as 100 million euros in unscheduled goodwill writedowns
against Selftrade," DAB Bank said.

writedowns of 18.8 million euros for Selftrade, 31 million euros in
integration costs, 6.8 million euros in writedowns against Business
Channel and 6.7 million euros in restructuring costs, it said.

176.47 million euros last year from 233.53 million euros on a proforma
basis in 2000.
Among the different earnings components, net interest income before
risk provisions was down at 45.31 million euros after 51.63 million
