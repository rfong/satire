Senate approves bill to tighten US embargo on Cuba 
The US Senate Thursday approved a bill tightening the US embargo on
Cuba, a day after Republican lawmakers dropped a controversial clause
opposed by the Clinton administration.
Senators voted 74 to 24 to tighten the 33-year-old embargo on Cuba.
The vote came a day after Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, agreed to eliminate a provision that would have
given Cuban-Americans the right to sue third-party countries in US
courts to reclaim property seized by the Castro regime.
President Bill Clinton had vowed to veto the original bill.
In addition to the White House, many Senate Democrats and a few
Republicans had objected to the divisive provision, which would also
have also allowed Cuban-Americans to sue Cubans who purchased the
property initially confiscated by Cuban President Fidel Castro.
The Senate bill calls for US opposition to any aid to Cuba from
international financial institutions and tightens current laws
preventing other countries from reselling Cuban sugar to the United
States.
It also contains a clause, opposed by the White House, that cuts aid to
Russia equal to the rent Moscow pays for an intelligence listening post
on the communist Caribbean island.
