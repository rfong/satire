Dow Edges Down 
The New York stock market turned down today, pressured by a selloff in
technology shares.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.83 points to 7,721.14, erasing
the nearly 52-point gain in the earlier session. Broad-market indexes
also weakened late in the day.
An announcement of a three-month delay in the launching of Microsoft's
Windows 98 software triggered a selloff at the market.
The steep fall in Microsoft shares ignited the late-day decline, and
other major technology stocks soon followed, including Intel, IBM and
Cisco Systems.
Advancing issues still outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 467.47 million shares,
down from 543.35 million Friday.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 4.14 at 919.77, the NYSE
composite index fell 0.70 at 482.60 and the American Stock Exchange
composite index rose 2.35 to 674.66.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 14.41 to 1,634.92, weighed down by the
selloff of technology stocks.
