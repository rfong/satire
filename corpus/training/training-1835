Yeltsin's China Trip to Raise Bilateral Ties to New 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's upcoming visit to China, scheduled to
begin on April 24, will raise Russian-Chinese relations to "a new
level," Yeltsin's foreign policy aide Dmitry Ryurikov said today.
Ryurikov told a news briefing in the Kremlin this afternoon that "it
will be a major event not only for bilateral relations but also an
event of the year in the international political life."
He stressed that Yeltsin's coming official visit would take "Russia and
China to a new level of rapprochement by all parameters."
He noted that the forthcoming tour of the Russian President will bring
about a third Sino-Russian summit and a second trip of the Russian head
of state to China in four years.
"This confirms the great importance which the Russian leadership
attaches to the development of Russian-Chinese relations," Ryurikov
said.
The Russian President's aide stressed at the same time that there will
be no discussion at all, during the visit, about any move to build a
Russia-China axis.
"Our two countries do not plan to conclude an alliance but are
determined to develop equitable good-neighborly relations," Ryurikov
emphasized, noting that such relations also benefit peace and stability
not only in the Asian-Pacific region but also in the whole world.
Questioned about the so-called triangle relations between Russian,
China and the United States, he said that Moscow only wants to develop
relations with China but does not intend to play the "China Card".
Russia hopes for good relations between Beijing and Washington, he
stated.
"Although there are certain differences between the two countries,
Russia and China are firmly determined to settle all disputes on the
basis of reason and pragmatic approach," Ryurikov said.
According to the aide, "a hot communication line" will be opened
between Moscow and Beijing for Yeltsin and the Chinese leaders during
the visit to make prompt decisions on pressing problems.
