People in Favor of Reforms in China 
Most urban residents responding to a survey say that they are in favor
of the present reforms, according to the Beijing-based "China Reform
News."
China successfully began a process of macro-economic reforms in
taxation, banking, foreign exchange, and foreign trade to build a base
for a socialist market economy last year, and this year will focus on
reforms in the structure of State-run enterprises.
The survey, which was carried out by the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy, was conducted in May among 1,867 households
from 40 cities in 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.
Altogether 88.4 percent of the people surveyed are in favor of the
reforms, which reflects an increase of 1.2 percentage points from last
year. Responses showed that 70.6 percent expressed satisfaction with
the reforms, an increase of three percentage points over last year, and
69.6 percent said the reforms are promising, an increase of 1.5
percentage points.
The proportion of the number of people who think that the direction of
the reforms is correct, rose from 77 percent in 1993 to 80.7 percent in
1994, and 83.4 percent at present. Those who think that the speed of
the reforms is proper have gone from 23.6 percent to 23.8.
The number of people who are confident that the reforms can reach the
market economy goal, grew from 61.4 percent last year to 67.4 percent
now.
"All this indicates that the situation of China's reforms is developing
favorably with the approval of the people," the paper noted.
The survey also has found that young people place a lower value on the
reforms, thinking the pace of reforms rather slow, and the society
unstable.
Those with better education hold a more positive view on reforms and
pin higher hope on the future but they also said the pace of reforms
was slow and worried about the unstable social environment.
Those who have benefitted more tend to place higher hope on the future
of the reforms but regard the speed of reforms as somewhat slow and
conditions for the reforms unstable.
Those with higher incomes approve of the reforms and are satisfied with
the achievements, while urban people, whose living standard is
dropping, tend to be pessimistic about the reforms.
