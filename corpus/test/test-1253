Duchess of York Had Two AIDS Tests 
The Duchess of York says she has twice been tested for AIDS -- before
and after her marriage, according to an interview published by a
Portuguese newspaper Tuesday.
The former Sarah Ferguson, estranged wife of Prince Andrew, the second
son of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, was in Portugal to help raise
funds for an AIDS awareness campaign.
Asked by Portugal's Diario de Noticias if she had had a test for the
HIV virus, the duchess reportedly responded, ``Of course! Once before I
was married and once before becoming pregnant.''
Although generally refusing to answer other personal queries, when
asked about condom use she said, ``We have to adapt to circumstances in
life. I don't think this makes a difference. I am very practical. What
has to be, has to be.''
At the time of her marriage to Prince Andrew in 1986, when she was 26,
Sarah Ferguson's former relationship with racing driver Paddy McNally
was acknowledged -- a fact seen as a sign of palace acceptance of
changing times and mores.
Her husband had been photographed with an array of eligible women
throughout his bachelor days, including former soft-porn actress Koo
Stark.
The couple's first child, Princess Beatrice, was born in 1988. A second
daughter, Princess Eugenie, was born in 1990.
On Tuesday, the duchess said she wanted to draw attention to the
``dramatic situation'' of an HIV-infected man -- the brother of a
Portuguese friend -- who couldn't get an appendectomy at a Portuguese
hospital.
``I'm here to stir up the waters,'' she said.
She certainly caused some ripples back home.
Her anouncement played prominently in the evening news broadcasts, and
the Evening Standard gave the story a page one banner headline above a
photo of the duchess embracing an AIDS patient in Portugal.
It also reviewed the controversies over her friendship with American
millionaire Steve Wyatt before the separation, and her sojourn in the
south of France where she was photographed sunbathing topless with
financial adviser John Bryan.
The duchess, who was welcomed to Portugal by President Mario Soares, is
honorary spokeswoman for Abraco, the Portuguese charity for AIDS
patients.
``There are many incurable diseases, and all of their sufferers have
the right to live and die with dignity,'' she said.
