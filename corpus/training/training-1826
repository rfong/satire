Europe's rabbis rap Israeli colleagues 
European rabbis condemned Monday their Israeli colleagues, who defied
their country's secular political and military leadership in opposing
the Middle East peace process.
Meeting here for their regular six-monthly conference, the rabbis spoke
out strongly against all forms of extremism and intolerance and
described as "grotesque" the claim by Yigal Amir, the right-wing
extremist who shot Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin late Saturday,
that he had been acting on God's instructions.
Chairing the meeting, Lord Immanuel Jakobovits, former head of the
Board of British Deputies, acknowledged that there were deep divisions
among the rabbinical community and within the Jewish people, but
criticised religious leaders who stood out against the peace process.
Jews in Israel and in the world diaspora have been sharply at odds over
the Middle East peace process, and the depth of their divisions was
brought sharply into focus by Rabin's assassination at a public rally
held to promote peace.
The European conference of rabbis, founded in 1957, draws up to 120
rabbis from all over Europe.
