NATO Air Raids Trigger Toxic Spill in Belgrade 
NATO air strikes Friday night caused the spillage of toxic products
outside Belgrade, prompting the authorities to urge the public to
protect themselves with gas masks or wet towels.
The spillage occurred at Sremcica on the southwestern outskirts of
Belgrade.
Zozan Popovic of Yugoslavia's Social Democratic Party said in an
interview with the CNN that a pharmaceutical company, where chemical
materials were stored, was hit during Friday night's NATO strikes.
The public was warned of a toxic danger, he said.
The bombardment was "really inhuman," said Popovic. There is "a lot of
casualties."
More than 10 powerful explosions rocked Belgrade, the capital of
Yugoslavia, at 10:30 p.m. local time (2130 GMT) Friday night, the third
night of NATO air strikes.
NATO planes raided the outskirts of Belgrade shortly after 10: 30 p.m.
local time (2130 GMT) and several military targets came under attack to
the southeast of the capital, an official Yugoslav radio reported.
Witnesses said that they saw a firewall on the horizon.
