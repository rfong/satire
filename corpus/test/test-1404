NGOs Involvement Worries Bangladeshi Private Entrepreneurs 
Bangladesh's private sector is faced with an uneven competition as the
non-governmental organizations NGOs), backed by soft loans and grants,
are making business ventures in a bigger way, a Dhaka Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (DCCI) official was quoted by The Daily Star as
saying Sunday.
"We are noticing with concern that the private sector is facing an
uneven competition from the NGO-run businesses which get tax exemptions
and capital at nominal rates," said Aftab ul Islam, President of the
DCCI, while addressing a seminar "Recent Trend of The Country's Economy
and WTO" Saturday.
Investments by the NGOs have increased significantly over the years and
have become a major player in business, he noted, adding that the NGOs
are now dominating many sectors, including the telecommunications and
printing.
He also apprehended that the NGOs might become a major player in the
gas and mineral resources sectors in future.
In this context, Islam demanded a clear policy for NGOs to ensure
transparency and accountability in their financial activities so that
the private sector and the NGOs are placed on a level playing field.
The DCCI chief also said the worsening law and order situation in the
country compounded by confrontational politics is taking a heavy toll
on business activities.
Mentioning that a total of 286 days have been wasted during the last 10
years due to hartals (destructive strikes), Islam urged the political
parties to avoid politics of confrontation and help prepare the country
to face the challenges.
