Crushing/VBG defeat/NN for/IN Zimbabwe/NNP 's/POS opposition/NN in/IN elections/NNS by/IN Susan/NNP Njanji/NNP Zimbabwe/NNP 's/POS opposition/NN has/VBZ been/VBN badly/RB defeated/VBN in/IN general/JJ elections/NNS ,/, winning/VBG only/RB two/CD of/IN the/DT 120/CD contested/JJ parliamentary/JJ seats/NNS ,/, as/IN the/DT governing/VBG ZANU-PF/NN walked/VBD easily/RB to/TO victory/NN ./.

Final/JJ results/NNS Tuesday/NNP gave/VBD President/NNP Robert/NNP Mugabe/NNP 's/POS ZANU-PF/NN ,/, a/DT sweeping/JJ majority/NN of/IN 118/CD contested/VBN seats/NNS after/IN the/DT weekend/NN poll/NN ,/, plus/CC 30/CD over/IN which/WDT the/DT party/NN controls/VBZ the/DT appointment/NN ./.

The/DT opposition/NN 's/POS performance/NN is/VBZ feebler/JJ than/IN it/PRP was/VBD in/IN the/DT last/JJ vote/NN in/IN 1990/CD where/WRB it/PRP came/VBD out/RP with/IN three/CD seats/NNS between/IN two/CD parties/NNS ./.

One/PRP was/VBD for/IN ZANU-Ndonga/NNP and/CC two/CD went/VBD to/TO the/DT Zimbabwe/NNP Unity/NNP Movement/NNP of/IN Edgar/NNP Tekere/NNP ,/, which/WDT this/DT year/NN boycotted/VBN the/DT polls/NNS ./.

The/DT regionally-based/JJ conservative/JJ ZANU-Ndonga/NN won/VBD two/CD seats/NNS in/IN its/PRP$ traditional/JJ stronghold/NN district/NN of/IN Chipinge/NNP ,/, near/IN the/DT eastern/JJ border/NN with/IN neighbouring/VBG Mozambique/NNP ./.

Ndonga/NNP is/VBZ led/VBN by/IN veteran/NN nationalist/JJ and/CC founding/JJ leader/NN of/IN the/DT now/JJ ruling/NN ZANU-PF/NN in/IN the/DT 1960s/NNS ,/, Ndabaningi/NNP Sithole/NNP ./.

The/DT Forum/NNP Party/NNP of/IN Zimbabwe/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- FPZ/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, once/RB seen/VBN as/IN the/DT only/RB formidable/JJ challenger/NN to/TO ZANU-PF/NN ,/, went/VBD down/RB badly/RB even/RB in/IN affluent/JJ urban/JJ constituencies/NNS where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ believed/VBN to/TO draw/VB most/JJS of/IN its/PRP$ support/NN from/IN white/JJ liberals/NNS ./.

A/DT political/JJ observer/NN ,/, Ibbo/NNP Mandaza/NNP ,/, said/VBD the/DT biggest/JJS surprise/NN of/IN the/DT polls/NNS was/VBD the/DT complete/JJ loss/NN of/IN FPZ/NNP ,/, which/WDT was/VBD tipped/VBN by/IN many/JJ to/TO pick/VB a/DT seat/NN or/CC two/CD in/IN the/DT towns/NNS ./.

But/CC its/PRP$ leader/NN ,/, former/JJ chief/JJ justice/NN Enoch/NNP Dumbutshena/NNP ,/, remarked/VBD :/: ``/`` Given/VBN the/DT meager/JJ resources/NNS we/PRP had/VBD ,/, I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP did/VBD very/RB well/RB ,/, ''/'' referring/VBG to/TO the/DT margins/NNS by/IN which/WDT the/DT leading/VBG party/NN candidates/NNS faired/VBD ./.

Although/IN the/DT two/CD leading/JJ opposition/NN parties/NNS that/WDT participated/VBD in/IN the/DT polls/NNS tried/VBD not/RB to/TO compete/VB for/IN votes/NNS by/IN fielding/VBG rival/JJ candidates/NNS ,/, the/DT results/NNS proved/VBD the/DT power/NN ZANU-PF/NN party/NN still/RB wields/VBZ among/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS electorate/NN ./.

The/DT parties/NNS failed/VBD to/TO field/VB candidates/NNS in/IN all/DT constituencies/NNS due/JJ to/TO lack/NN of/IN financial/JJ resources/NNS ./.

Only/RB ZANU-PF/NN was/VBD entitled/VBN to/TO four/CD million/CD US/NNP dollars/NNS under/IN the/DT political/JJ parties/NNS act/NN which/WDT stipulates/VBZ that/IN only/JJ parties/NNS with/IN a/DT minimum/NN of/IN 15/CD parliamenmtary/JJ seats/NNS get/VBP state/NN funding/NN ./.

Dumbutshena/NNP said/VBD there/EX was/VBD widespread/JJ apathy/RB in/IN urban/JJ areas/NNS ,/, while/IN in/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT country/NN ,/, ``/`` people/NNS blindly/RB follow/VBP ZANU-PF/NN ./.

Perhaps/RB when/WRB they/PRP have/VBP suffered/VBN enough/RB is/VBZ when/WRB they/PRP will/MD follow/VB the/DT examples/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ neighbouring/VBG countries/NNS ./. ''/''

He/PRP was/VBD referring/VBG to/TO the/DT overthow/NN of/IN Kenneth/NNP Kaunda/NNP in/IN Zambia/NNP and/CC Kamuzu/NNP Banda/NNP in/IN Malawi/NNP ./.

But/CC some/DT commentators/NNS argue/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT lack/NN of/IN formidable/JJ opposition/NN that/WDT led/VBD many/JJ of/IN the/DT electorate/NN to/TO vote/VB for/IN the/DT ruling/VBG party/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN at/IN the/DT helm/NN since/IN the/DT overthrow/NN of/IN the/DT white/JJ minority/NN government/NN and/CC independence/NN in/IN 1980/CD ./.

The/DT opposition/NN has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN disarray/NN and/CC characterised/VBN by/IN endless/JJ mergers/NNS and/CC divisions/NNS ./.

It/PRP failed/VBD to/TO agree/VB on/IN a/DT stance/NN to/TO take/VB on/IN participation/NN in/IN the/DT polls/NNS ./.

Five/CD parties/NNS boycotted/VBN on/IN grounds/NNS of/IN flaws/NNS in/IN the/DT constitution/NN and/CC electoral/JJ laws/NNS ,/, while/IN another/DT five/CD stayed/VBD in/IN the/DT race/NN in/IN hope/NN of/IN clinching/VBG enough/JJ opposition/NN voices/NNS to/TO be/VB heard/VBN in/IN parliament/NN ./.

The/DT opposition/NN 's/POS failure/NN has/VBZ also/RB been/VBN blamed/VBN on/IN the/DT parties/NNS being/VBG too/RB personalised/VBN rather/RB than/IN programmatic/VBN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD confident/JJ of/IN winning/VBG the/DT hearts/NNS of/IN the/DT electorate/NN by/IN capitalising/VBG on/IN the/DT widespread/JJ discontent/NN brought/VBN about/IN by/IN the/DT market-oriented/JJ economic/JJ reforms/NNS ./.

The/DT electorate/NN ,/, particularly/RB urban/JJ ,/, has/VBZ complained/VBN that/IN ZANU-PF/NN has/VBZ plunged/VBN Zimbabwe/NNP into/IN an/DT abyss/NNS ,/, with/IN a/DT high/JJ cost/NN of/IN living/VBG as/IN a/DT consequence/NN of/IN World/NNP Bank-backed/JJ austerity/NN measures/NNS ,/, escalating/VBG unemployment/NN ,/, high/JJ medical/JJ costs/NNS ./.

While/IN election/NN officials/NNS say/VBP the/DT voter/NN turnout/NN statistics/NNS are/VBP internationally/RB competitive/JJ ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN an/DT explicit/JJ downward/JJ trend/NN since/IN the/DT last/JJ two/CD general/JJ elections/NNS ./.

In/IN 1985/CD ,/, around/RB 90/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT eligible/JJ electorate/NN cast/VBD their/PRP$ ballots/NNS ,/, in/IN 1990/CD about/IN 60/CD ,/, and/CC 57/CD percent/NN this/DT year/NN ./.

Amid/IN suspicion/NN in/IN some/DT quarters/NNS that/IN voter/NN turnout/NN figures/NNS could/MD have/VB been/VBN inflated/VBN ,/, others/NNS analysts/NNS say/VBP they/PRP could/MD be/VB correct/JJ ,/, showing/VBG the/DT amazing/JJ powers/NNS with/IN which/WDT Mugabe/NNP can/MD mobilise/VB the/DT electorate/NN ./.

Just/RB two/CD weeks/NNS prior/RB to/TO the/DT elections/NNS people/NNS were/VBD not/RB keen/JJ on/IN the/DT polls/NNS as/IN they/PRP knew/VBD ZANU-PF/NN ,/, which/WDT had/VBD already/RB secured/VBN 55/CD of/IN the/DT 120/CD seats/NNS ,/, would/MD win/VB ./.

But/CC Mugabe/NNP 's/POS campaign/NN turned/VBD the/DT tide/NN and/CC raised/VBD the/DT mood/NN for/IN the/DT elections/NNS ./.

Meanwhile/RB ,/, Sithole/NNP said/VBD his/PRP$ party/NN had/VBD deserved/VBN to/TO win/VB 25/CD seats/NNS if/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB for/IN voter/NN intimidation/NN ./.
