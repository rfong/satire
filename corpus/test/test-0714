Arab FMs Meet for Unified Stance on Iraq 
Foreign ministers from 16 Arab states met here Sunday in a bid to reach
a unified stance on the Iraqi issue.
The developments of the Iraqi situation after the mid-December
U.S.-British attack on the country and U.N. sanctions on Iraq top the
agenda of the meeting.
The U.S. and Britain launched four-day air strikes against Iraq last
month for what the U.S. denounced as Baghdad's failure to comply with
the U.N. arms inspections.
The U.N. economic sanctions, imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, will not be lifted until the U.N. arms inspectors certify that
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed.
The foreign ministers will seek ways of restoring Arab reconciliation
and solidarity.
Prior to the meeting, Arab foreign ministers conducted extensive
consultations to try to work out a statement which will spell out
unified Arab policies towards the Iraqi issue.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf called Saturday on the
Arab countries to condemn the U.S.-British attack on Iraq and support
Baghdad's demand for the lifting of the sanctions.
But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday that Arab
countries would not agree to defy U.N. resolutions.
A draft statement for the foreign ministers' meeting proposed that the
Arab countries express sympathy for the plight of the Iraqi people
under the crippling trade embargo.
But it will stop short of voicing support for the government of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. It will also urge Iraq to fully abide by the
U.N. resolutions.
