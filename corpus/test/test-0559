Aldair Out for Season 
AS Roma's Brazilian defender Aldair will be outlined for the rest of
the season due to a knee injury, local reports said on Monday.
The veteran sustained his injury during Saturday's 1-0 victory over
Atalanta at the Olympic Stadium.
Aldair said he hopes to make a token appearance in Roma's closing match
with Parma in what he hopes will be a Scudetto celebration party.
With four games remaining Roma lead Lazio by five points and Juventus
by six.
