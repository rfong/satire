South China Province to Enhance Environmental Protection 
South China's Guangdong province plans to spend some 56 billion yuan
(about 7 billion US dollars) in environmental protection during the
1996-2000 period, officials said.
Statistics show that government input will account for about 30 percent
of the total funding, and that from enterprises will make up 40
percent. Another 30 percent will come from loans.
Tang Bingquan, the province's vice-governor, told China Environmental
News that pollution has held back the province's economic development
and threatened people's health.
Tang stressed that the provincial government will increase its input in
environmental protection, arranging 20 million yuan a special fund for
the environment every year during the 1996-2000 period.
"The fund will increase with the growth of the province's financial
capacity," Tang added.
Guangdong officials have asked all provincial cities and counties to
earmark funds for environmental protection.
Tang stressed that three things are "absolutely not allowed" in the
province's environmental protection campaign: sacrificing the
environment for economic development; ignoring the best interests of
future generations in order to satisfy the desires of today's
generation; and overlooking general and long-term interests for
benefits now.
