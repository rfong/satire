Romania-Hungary Relation Applauded 
Relations between Romania and Hungary were applauded by the foreign
ministers of both countries during a press conference following their
talks Thursday.
Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Kavacs Laszlo said he was
satisfied with the practice of the Agreement on mutual understanding,
cooperation and good-neighborly relations established between Hungary
and Romania. His Romanian counterpart, Andrian Severin, affirmed that
the two countries will cooperate and help each other on their way to
NATO and European Union membership.
In the earlier meeting between Kovacs and Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu, both sides said their governments will take steps to
combat any action that would spoil the national minority issues between
the two neighboring countries, the Rompres news agency reported.
The two foreign ministers on Wednesday attended the opening ceremony of
a mixed government committee, to enhance cooperation and
active-partnership relations between the two nations.
Severin told Rompres that the mixed committee is a "capable instrument"
to implement the mutual agreement and establish "an active strategic
partnership" between the two countries. "We want to set up a foundation
stone of true mutual stability and prosperity in Europe," the Romanian
foreign minister was quoted as saying.
