Amending charter is in Palestinian interests: PLO official 
A member of the PLO's parliament in exile called Tuesday for the PLO
charter to be amended in the Palestinians' own interests, rather than
because Israel demands it.
Israel has insisted the parliament, the Palestine National Council,
vote to scap articles in the charter calling for the destruction of the
Jewish state as the price for continuing the peace process.
"Not only does the national charter contain articles calling for
Israel's destruction, but it fails to call formally for the creation of
a Palestinian state," Suleiman Najab told Al-Ayam daily.
"Moderning the PLO charter is in the interest of the Palestinian
people, above and beyond being an Israeli demand," said Najab, a member
of the former communist Palestine People's Party.
The charter can only be changed by a two-thirds vote of the PNC, which
includes fierce opponents of the peace process.
Under the PLO-Israeli peace accords, the Palestinians pledged to amend
the charter within two months of the first meeting of their
newly-elected legislative council, expected to be held in late
February.
"The PNC must meet as soon as possible to amend the charter and
strengthen the PLO," Najab said.
Israel has given permission for all 630 members of the PNC, most of
whom live in exile, to return to the Palestinian territories for a
meeting on amending the charter.
