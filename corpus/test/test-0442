ADB: Financial Crisis Causes Great Social Impact 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Tuesday that the Asian financial
crisis has caused turmoil throughout the affected economies in such
areas as employment, prices, human development, poverty and social
capital.
"The social consequences of the crisis vary across countries according
to the extent of the downturn and dislocation," said the bank in its
"Asian Development Outlook 1999" released here Tuesday.
While the poor and vulnerable groups, such as women, children, and
migrant workers, are invariably most at risk, the bank said, the impact
of the 22-month-old crisis is pervasive, hurting all social classes,
particularly middle-and-lower-middle-income ones.
The bank said the unemployment rate in Indonesia rose to 5.5 percent in
1998 from 4.7 in 1997, and in Thailand the rate reached 5.3 percent,
compared with just above 1 percent the previous year.
The unemployment rate in South Korea more than doubled to 6.8 percent
last year, while in the Philippines it climbed to 9.6 percent, it said.
"However, these figures probably underestimated the true extent of the
problem, as underemployment is also likely to have increased markedly,"
the bank said.
Besides, the bank said, the crisis has reduced household expenditure in
a number of important social areas, including health and nutrition,
education, and family planning.
"With reduced incomes and higher prices for such items as medicines and
school supplies, households tend to cut down far too much on their
consumption of these important items," it said.
According to the bank, the crisis also has had a serious impact on
education in the most affected economies like Indonesia and Thailand.
In Indonesia, 6 million students have dropped out of school while in
Thailand, the number is about 250,000, it said.
At the same time, The bank said, the crisis is setting back the
spectacular strides made in the fight against poverty during the last
two decades.
About 6 million Indonesians and 1 million Thais are falling below
official poverty lines, it said.
"These are huge numbers that require urgent policy attention, but are
far less than claimed by earlier reports," the bank said.
It said the adverse social consequences of the crisis are clearly
severe and require urgent action on the part of governments to provide
adequate social safety nets.
"However," it said, "the only long-term solution is to ensure a return
to broadly based and sustained growth."
