Singapore Stresses Commitment to Defense 
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Tony Tan said on
Wednesday that despite the current economic downturn, Singapore must be
prepared to commit resources to ensure the country's security.
Speaking at an event marking the completion of the upgrading of the
Singapore Air Force's F-5 Tiger, Tan said that building a credible
defense force is a long-term process which requires prudent and steady
investment over many years.
He said that the peace of mind the Singaporeans and investors have is
due to Singapore's defense philosophy, which is to be prepared at all
times for any eventuality.
"Our spending on defense, which we have as a policy capped at 6 percent
of the gross domestic product, is a small premium to pay to secure our
peace," he said.
