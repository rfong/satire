SingTel to raise market share in Asia-Pacific data hosting services 
Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (SingTel) said Wednesday it is aimimg
to corner eight percent of the 2.5 billion-dollar (1.2 billion US)
Asia-Pacific market for data hosting services by 2005.
This would amount to 200 million dollars in annual earnings from
managed hosting services (MHS), SingTel said in a statement.
SingTel, which acquired Australia's Cable and Wireless Optus Ltd. last
year, will launch the service in Sydney next month to complete a
regional network of data centres spanning Singapore, Hong Kong, South
Korea and Taiwan.
The centres are linked through SingTel's submarine cable systems,
including the C2C cable network in which it has a majority stake.
Managed hosting services are also available in China, India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand through SingTel's alliances with
local partners.
Mary Ong, SingTel chief executive for MHS, said the current market of
1.1 dollars is expected to grow to 2.5 billion dollars by 2005.
"We have set ourselves a target of eight percent market share, or an
annual revenue of about 200 million dollars in three years' time," she
said.
Last month, SingTel said it has earmarked 20 million US dollars in the
next 12 months for the management and operation of two data centres in
Hong Kong.
The MHS project is part of a regional initiative by the Singapore
telecoms giant to meet a growing demand among multinational
corporations and Internet-based businesses to outsource some services.
Under the project, SingTel will provide the communications network
operations, application services and web hosting needs of companies
which prefer a third-party source rather than spend more money on
infrastructure and equipment.
SingTel chief executive Lee Hsien Yang has said that by 2003, up to 70
percent of multinational corporations would be outsourcing at least
parts of their information technology operations to a third party.
