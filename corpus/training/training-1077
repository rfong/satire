Taiwan food giant kills power plant project in China 
Taiwan's food giant President Enterprises Group has decided to give up
a 100-million-US-dollar thermal power plant project in China, group
officials said Thursday.
The decision was prompted by unfavorable terms China offered to acquire
stakes in the project to establish two thermal power plants in Wuhan,
Hubei province, the officials said.
President Enterprises, the island's largest investor in the mainland
with 15 investment projects totalling 200 million US dollars, will
instead concentrate on the Taiwanese market in line with the government
policy.
The group will invest over 30 billion Taiwan dollars ( 1.1 billion US)
to set up large-scale shopping malls in Tainan and Kaohsiung in
sourther Taiwan and penetrate the island's potential phamaceutical
market, they added.
Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui asked authorities last month to work
out guidelines to check increasing Taiwanese investments in the
mainland and called on local firms to focus on investing in the island.
The comments were seen as a policy U-turn, shifting from fully
developing economic ties with China to restricting investments on the
mainland.
Taiwan's petrochemical giant Formosa Plastics Group retracted an
application for approval from the Investment Commision of its
three-billion-US-dollar power project in Zhangzhou following remarks by
President Lee.
Taiwan and China have been bitter rival since the end of a civil war in
1949, but in recent years Taiwan has permitted private and indrect
trade exchanges with the mainland.
Some 30,000 Taiwanese firms have invested 25 billion US dollars in
various proejcts on the mainland, with or without government approval,
to cash in on cheaper raw materials and labor there.
