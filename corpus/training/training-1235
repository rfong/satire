Saitov snatches sprint as Ugrumov fades 
Russian Asiate Saitov sprinted to victory in the 18th stage of the Tour
of Spain here on Thursday, just edging out Dane Jesper Skibby.
France's Laurent Jalabert retained his overall lead of almost
six-and-a-half minutes with just three days to go. He crossed the line
in ninth after the 158km course, just ahead of Spaniard Abraham Olano,
his chief rival for the Vuelta crown.
The major loser of the day -- the last in the Pyrenees -- was Latvian
Piotr Ugrumov, who escaped after 37km in a four-man break. At one stage
he led on his own by three minutes but his legs failed him near the
finish and he was caught with 50m to go before finishing seventh.
The 19th stage will be run between Sabinanigo to Calatayud.
