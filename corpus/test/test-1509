Mozambique and Iran discuss military cooperation 
Mozambique and Iran may sign a military cooperation agreement this
week, Mozambique's Defence Minister Aguiar Mazula said Monday.
Mazula was speaking in Maputo at the start of talks with visiting
Iranian Minister of Defence Mohammad Foruzandeh.
He said that Iran had shown interest in supporting mine clearance
efforts in Mozambique and military training.
Only about 30,000 of the estimated two million land mines hidden in
Mozambican soil during the civil war which ended in 1992 have been
removed and the country's unified army is over 15,000 soldiers short.
Under the peace agreement ending the 16-year civil war the army should
be 30,000 strong.
