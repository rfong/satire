Daly Feels the Pain With Sports-Golf-British Open ST. 
John Daly admits he was a headache in his wild days. Now he's the one
with a pain in the head.
The former PGA titlist, who has given up alcohol, has been suffering
migraines for several weeks.
``I never had a hangover when I drank, but now I am getting these
headaches all the time. It doesn't make any sense to me,'' he said. ``I
had headaches for eight to 10 hours at a time and sometimes they just
wouldn't quit.''
Daly, who shot a first round 67 on Thursday to share the first day's
lead with Tom Watson, Masters titlist Ben Crenshaw, and Mark McNulty of
Zimbabwe, said the headaches started around the Greater Hartford
tournament a month ago. Although they're not so bad now, he's still is
under orders from the doctors.
``I have got to walk slower,'' he said, ``and the doctors have told me
to stay off caffeine.'' ___ BAKER-FINCH BLOWOUT: Winner of the 1991
British Open, Ian Baker-Finch had an embarrassing start to this year's
tournament at the home of golf.
As he was in mid-swing on the first tee at St Andrews, a gust of wind
got up, blew off his cap and made a mess of his tee shot.
Somehow, the Australian, who won at Royal Birkdale, failed to keep the
ball on the biggest fairway in the world.
His ball flew way off course to the left, bounced in front of
spectators expecting to watch players on the 18th, and rolled through
the fence onto the road.
He had to play again with a penalty stroke and Baker-Finch wound up
with a double bogey six, the worst score of any of the 159 players on
the opening hole.
To make things worse for the Australian, he also double-bogeyed the
13th and 17th and ended with a five over round of 77. ___ PRICE STEALS
BIRDIE AT ROAD HOLE: Defending champion Nick Price, who shot a 70, was
only one of two of the 159 players in the opening round to birdie the
Road Hole, the 17th at St Andrews statistically the toughest in
championship golf. The other was Steve Lowery of the United States in a
3-under round of 69.
Price rolled in a 30-foot putt after landing a 7-iron onto the green.
``It's like stealing,'' the Zimabwean said. ``I've had bogeys and
double bogeys at that hole.''
Lowery, on his first appearance at the home of golf, was ecstatic after
his 7 iron landed to within eight feet of the flag.
``I cannot describe how good that birdie at 17 felt,'' he said.
