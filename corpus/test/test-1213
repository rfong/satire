Britain looks to Henman to serve up Wimbledon success
After the exit of England's soccer squad from the World Cup, Britons
switched their focus to Tim Henman on Monday, hoping the tennis star would
boost their spirits and serve up sporting success at Wimbledon.
Over the next two weeks, up to half a million people are expected to
attend tennis's greatest grass tournament, which opened in southwest
London on Monday. The attention is firmly on bookies' favourite and
British number one Henman, who plays on Tuesday.
"Our footballing illusions may have been shattered by defeat to Brazil
in the World Cup on Friday but we can begin kidding ourselves all over
again," said a front page article in the Independent newspaper.
The Guardian said: "The weight of a nation's misplaced sporting
optimism will shift today from the far east to southwest London and
from the shoulders of England's footballers to those of perennial
Wimbledon contenders Tim Henman and (British number two) Greg
Rusedski."
Queen Elizabeth II, who is celebrating her golden jubilee as monarch
this year, has kept her diary free of all engagements on the weekend of
the final in case the opportunity arises for her to present the trophy
to a British winner, the Daily Telegraph reported.
The paper pointed out that in her silver jubilee year in 1977,
celebrating her 25 years on the throne, the Queen had presented a
trophy to Virginia Wade, the last Briton to win a Wimbledon
championship.
Commentators say Henman, the number four seed -- and 4 to 1 Wimbledon
favourite according to bookmakers William Hill -- has been handed a
great opportunity to fulfill his lifelong dream and become the first
British player to lift the title since Fred Perry in 1936.
Early on Monday fans were queuing in glorious sunshine outside the All
England Lawn Tennis Club in the capital, hoping to snatch up the last
remaining tickets for the first day of the tournament.
Some had staked out their spot as early as Friday morning, forming a
small tented village, to make sure of a chance to cheer on their
favourite players.
Frances Burgess, 42, from Evesham in central England, was at the front
of the queue. She had pitched her tent on Friday.
She said: "I do this every year and the atmosphere is already building.
I would love to see Tim Henman finally do it."
As well as having a good draw in the Grand Slam tournament, the
27-year-old Henman, who is approaching the peak of his career, has been
boosted by news that the top seed, Australian Lleyton Hewitt, is
struggling to reach full fitness after being struck down by a stomach
bug.
Seven-time champion, American Pete Sampras, is not the player who once
looked invincible, while both of last year's finalists, Croatian
champion Goran Ivanisevic and runner-up Pat Rafter, are absent.
During the national football team's run in the World Cup, England's St
George flag, a red cross on a white background, was on prominent
display on homes, shops and cars. A cartoon in Monday's edition of the
Guardian showed a car driver with a St George flag pinned to his radio
antenna. The man was pictured as saying: "I'll leave it on until Henman
gets knocked out."
American star Andre Agassi was opening proceedings on the Wimbledon
centre court at 1:00 pm (1200 GMT). Eight British players including
Greg Rusedski were also in action on the first day of the tournament.
