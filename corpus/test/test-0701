Sacked federation head reinstated by court
A protracted quarrel in the Russian Weightlifting Federation deepened
Monday when the Moscow city court confirmed a lower court decision to
reinstate the federation's ousted chief.
Victor Polyakov, who has presided over national weightlifting since the
1970s, was sacked in 1994, accused of establishing poor relations with
international weightlifting bodies, poor administration and financial
irregularities.
Wednesday's court decision upheld an appeal for Polyakov to be
reinstalled, saying his dismissal was illegal.
The current federation chief and 1988 Olympic champion, Israil
Arsamakov, told AFP that although most regional federations supported
him, he would now step down.
"I realize the truth is on my side, but I have no desire to be involved
in court disputes," Arsamakov said.
"Financial activity had been badly handled during Polyakov's reign,"
said Arsamakov, elected in 1994 and reelected two years later.
"I'm sure that all our contacts with the International Weightlifting
Federation will be totally blocked as soon as Polyakov comes back,"
Arsamakov said.
The conflict comes as the Russian national team prepares for the
European championships to be held next month in Croatia.
