Four Killed As Bunkhouse Blows Apart 
Four mine workers died when an explosion ripped apart their wooden
bunkhouse, hurling severed limbs 30 meters (yards), police said.
Four others were injured in the blast Thursday at a chromium mine at
Darwendale, 60 kilometers (38 miles) northwest of Harare.
The blast was believed caused by mine explosives one of the workers was
unpacking. Inspectors launched an inquiry into why at least 100 sticks
of explosive were not kept in a secure magazine.
