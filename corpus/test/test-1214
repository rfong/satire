China, Taiwan could sign repatriation accord Thursday 
China and Taiwan could sign an agreement on repatriating hijackers and
illegal immigrants as early as Thursday, sources said here during the
second day high-level talks Tuesday.
Tang Shubei, chairman for the mainland Association for Relationas
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), and his Taiwanese counterpart Chiao
Jen-ho, who heads the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), met Tuesday
afternoon for two hours, an ARATS official told AFP.
The official did not say whether new advances had been made by the two
semi-official bodies set up to manage relations between Beijing and
Taipei, both of whom claim to be the sole legitimate government of all
China.
The two officials met earlier Sunday at the opening of their seventh
round of talks since a historic meeting in Singapore in April 1993
between ARATS president Wang Daohan and his SEF counterpart Koo
Chen-fu.
On Sunday, Tang and Chiao agreed that an important step had been taken
toward a compromise on the sensitive issue of repatriating hijackers
and illegal immigrants, but said that precise details had not been
decided.
Earlier Tuesday, ARATS Vice Secretary-General Sun Yafu and his SEF
counterpart Shi Hwei-you had worked on a draft accord, the official
said.
Shi, quoted by the Chinese press, seemed optimistic about reaching the
signing stage. "A framework has been established and the content is
clear," he said.
SEF officials said late Tuesday that an accord could be signed Thursday
during the third and final face-to-face meeting between Tang and Chiao
which would open the way for a second summit between Wang and Koo in
the spring.
Talks between the two bodies until now were deadlocked on questions of
sovereignty in dealing with the issues, with Beijing refusing to
recognize Taipei's right to try mainlanders on the Island.
Taiwan's nationalist government fled to the island after its forces
were defeated in a civil war with the communists in 1949. Since then,
China has always considered Taiwan a renegade province that it would
eventually recover.
On Wednesday, working groups from ARATS and the SEF are to meet to
discuss the accord as well as fishing in the Taiwan Strait, an issue
not likely to be included in an accord at this point.
Following the talks in the Chinese capital, the SEF delegation will
travel to Shanghai on Friday for a meeting with the ARATS president.
