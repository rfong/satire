Seven killed and eight wounded in Lucapa ambush 
The secretary general of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) denied Tuesday that his movemement had killed seven
people in an ambush in Angola's Lunda Norte region.
According to a communique released by the Angolan army's chief of
staff, 24 people perished in the attack on Friday on the road betwen
Lucapa and Cambulo carried out by UNITA.
But independent sources contacted by AFP on Tuesday have put the figure
at seven dead, including three Filipinos with three Angolans and five
Filipinos seriously wounded.
Paulo Lukamba Gato, quoted by the Portuguese news agency LUSA, said the
ambush was carried out in an area under government control by "enemies
of peace." He said they wanted to destabilise the peace process by
attributing the attack to UNITA forces.
"It is necessary to persuade the government in Luanda to abandon its
logic of war," he said. He added the government was moving troops in
the southern province of Huila and in the north eastern regions of
Lunda-Norte and Lunda-Sol.
Gato said the international community had to make the government aware
that it was obliged to respect agreements thrashed out in Lusaka on the
formation of the Angolan Armed Forces, the disarmament of civilians and
the repatriation of mercenaries.
He said President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA chief Jonas Savimbi
were scheduled to meet in September in Brussels to ask for financial
support from countries to help them in their political and diplomatic
efforts to further the peace process.
According to the UN special representative in Angola, Alioune Blondin
Beye, the attack was a result of differences between diamond mining
companies.
He said the UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) had already written
a report on the incident compiled by representatives on site. However
he refused to give information on the circumstances of the ambush and
declined to divulge the number or identity of people killed.
The firm Sociedade Mineira de Lucapa (SML) which employed the victims
said the bodies of three Filipinos had been taken to Luanda and would
be sent home. According to SML, the five other Filipinos wounded in the
ambush were being tended at a Luanda clinic.
