Ogata arrives in Kenya after visiting Zairean refugee camp 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata arrived in Nairobi
Saturday for talks on the civil war raging in eastern Zaire after
visiting the threatened Tingi-Tingi refugee camp there.
Zairean rebels -- most of them Tutsis -- are advancing on the camp,
which is just south of Lubutu, the main town on a major road to
Kisangani, the government-held capital of Upper Zaire province.
UNHCR and other expatriate aid workers abandoned Tingi-Tingi on Friday,
flying out to Kisangani, after indisciplined government troops
threatened them and extorted money from them before allowing them to
leave, according to those who left.
Ogata flew to Kisangani and on to Tingi-Tingi -- a trip that officials
initially said would be cancelled -- after holding talks in Kinshasa
with Zairean government officials.
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko returned to Zaire Friday evening
after a month abroad but flew direct to his northern home-town of
Gbadolite, bypassing the capital.
More than a million Rwandan Hutus fled to Zaire in 1994 after a civil
war in their neighbouring country won by a Tutsi rebel army after Hutu
extremists had slaughtered more than 500,000 men, women and children.
Some 600,000 of the refugees returned to Rwanda after the Zairean
rebels under long-time dissident Laurent-Desire Kabila went on the
offensive last October, but the others -- hardliners among them -- fled
deeper into Zaire.
Some are fighting the rebels alongside government troops, but many
others have disappeared into rain forests, along with Zairean
villagers.
A UNHCR spokeswoman in Geneva said Friday that the UN refugee agency
was drawing up tentative plans to air-drop food to those fleeing, many
of whom are ill and malnourished.
Nairobi-based UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said Ogata would remain in
Nairobi until Monday, but would not hold talks with Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi because he was out of town.
Moi, whose country gives refuge to many prominent Hutus sought by the
new Tutsi-dominated regime in Rwanda, called Friday for the Tutsi
rebels in Zaire to declare an immediate ceasefire and withdraw from the
1,000-kilometre (600-mile)-long swathe of territory they have captured
in eastern Zaire along the borders with Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda.
Kabila, talking in his stronghold of Goma, on the border with Rwanda,
Friday rejected all calls for international intervention and
conferences, saying that Zaireans should be able to talk together as
"adults."
