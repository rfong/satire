Jordanian Girl Dies Just Before Life-Saving Operation In Israel 
Peace came too late for Heba Shaban, a 12-year-old Jordanian girl who
died in an Israeli hospital just days before a life-saving bone marrow
transplant.
Heba died late Friday of massive bleeding in the lungs, her doctor,
Shlomo Slavin of Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital, told Israel army radio.
The child's body, escorted by family members, was returned to Jordan on
Saturday. The family used the new Sheik Hussein border crossing which
was inaugurated Thursday, relatives said.
Heba suffered from aplastic anemia, a blood disorder for which
treatment is not available in Jordan. When Israel and Jordan signed a
peace treaty Oct. 26, Heba persuaded her father, Rushdie, to contact
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and seek help.
Rabin responded immediately, offering to bring her to Israel and to pay
dlrs 6,600 of the dlrs 40,000 procedure. Tests established Heba's
10-month-old brother, Mohammed, as a donor, and the family arrived in
Israel on Monday.
Asked then whether she thought she would get well, she said: ``God
willing.'' Overwhelmed by the crush of journalists waiting for her at
the hospital, the pale seventh-grader tightly held Slavin's hand as he
escorted her through the ward.
Slavin said at the time that with the transplant, Heba would have a
good chance to survive. Aplastic anemia retards the bone marrow's
ability to produce blood cells, leaving the patient vulnerable to
infection or sudden bleeding.
The transplant has been scheduled for Sunday or Mondy, after
preliminary treatment was completed.
