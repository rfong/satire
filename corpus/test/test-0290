Blair Defends Genetically-Modified Food 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Saturday delivered a spirited
defense of the government's refusal to ban genetically-modified (G-M)
food, warning that such a ban would jeopardize the UK's front position
on the development of biotechnology.
Blair said biotechnology will be "the revolutionary science of the 21st
century" and the United Kingdom (UK), which is leading the world in
this field, is facing intense international competition, reported the
Daily Telegraph newspaper.
To ban G-M food without proper scientific evidence will lead to the
loss of the UK's superiority, Blair said.
"There is no scientific evidence to justify a ban on G-M foods and
crops," he noted.
"If we were to ban products which our independent scientific advisers
tell us are safe, we would send a negative message to the whole
biotechnic industry in the UK -- that its future will be governed not
by evidence but by media scares," he stressed.
"And we would stop British expertise in farming and science from
leading the way," Blair said, adding that the government was committed
to guaranteeing consumer's safety and would insist that all G-M foods
be labelled.
The British government's refusal to stop and investigate the
development of G-M foods has been attacked in the past week due to
warnings by scientists that such foods posed potential harm to some
people's health.
Environmental groups want to freeze development for five years while
more tests are carried out.
