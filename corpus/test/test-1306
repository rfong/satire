Poland says it wants to join NATO by decade's end 
Poland wants to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation before the
end of the decade, deputy Polish defence minister Jerzy Milewski said
here Tuesday.
He was speaking at a ceremony to endorse the details of Poland's
military cooperation with NATO under the partnership for peace
programme launched in January.
Some 21 countries including Russia have so far joined the partnership
of military cooperation between NATO and its former Warsaw Pact
adversaries -- the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
But Poland is the first country of the partnership to have details of
its military links formally accepted by NATO.
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Robert Mroziewicz, said during the
ceremony: "It is but the beginning of a process which should lead
towards Poland's membership of NATO."
Later, Milewski spelled out Poland's aim more clearly. He told
journalists: "We are hoping to reach this goal in this decade."
Mroziewicz stressed that Poland's drive towards NATO membership was not
aimed at seeking protection from Russia.
But he warned that Russia should not be allowed to prevent Poland from
joining NATO.
"We do not want to create new divisions. On the contrary we strive to
overcome the remnants of past divisions which unfortunately are still
with us," Mroziewicz said.
