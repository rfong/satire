Hearts pair appeal over ban 
Heart of Midlothian defenders Craig Levein and Graeme Hogg have
appealed against a 10-match ban by the Scottish Football Association.
The pair were sent off after they traded punches in a pre-season
friendly match against Raith Rovers.
Hearts are backing their players as they feel they have already been
dealt with by the club. The Premier Division club fined both players
and put them on the transfer list, while Levein was also stripped of
the club captaincy.
