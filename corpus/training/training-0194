Tanzanian PM Urges to Increase Coffee Production 
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has called on stakeholders in
the coffee growing sector to revamp the industry by adopting feasible
and sustainable development plans to enable coffee farmers increase
production, newspapers here reported on Tuesday.
Speaking on Monday at the 5th annual coffee conference for stakeholders
in the northern town of Moshi, the prime minister urged the
participants to boost coffee production per unit area by using
expertise, inputs and planting new seedlings to attain the projected
70,000 tons of annual output by the year 2005.
He stressed that increased coffee production was crucial in the fight
against poverty, adding that a strong agricultural sector can help
driving growth in other sectors.
Sumaye told the stakeholders in coffee business, government policy
makers and financial institution officials that the liberalization of
coffee marketing did not mean compromising on the quality of the crop.
There was need to improve Tanzania's coffee quality to the highest
degree so as to face stiff competition in international markets, Sumaye
noted, because most of produced coffee was marketed abroad.
Coffee has been the major export in Tanzania's foreign trade for the
last two to three decades with an annual earning of 400 million U.S.
dollars.
Currently standing at 50,000 tons, the annual coffee output in Tanzania
has slumped in recent years because of bad weather conditions and
mostly, economic factors.
