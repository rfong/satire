Khamenei Urges for Education of Young People 
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei here on Wednesday called
on officials to pay "serious attention" to the education of the young
people.
According to the official news agency IRNA, Khamenei told officials of
the center for the intellectual promotion of children and the young
adults that the Islamic revolution wants a young generation to get
learned and go forward with an inquiring spirit and intelligence.
"We are required to think of the education of children and the young
adults and accord high importance to it, but, unfortunately, some
people involved in cultural affairs do not give the due attention to
it," he said.
Iran's official figures showed that about 51 percent of the country's
population are under the age of 20 and were born after the 1979 Islamic
revolution which topple the shah's regime. It has become a serious
concern for the Islamic leadership.
Khamenei also expressed concern over foreign influence on Iran's
younger generation, saying that foreign cultural centers are making
every attempt to reach the young people "through their corrupt cultural
means."
However, he said, "I believe we can block the access of foreigners to
our children through our good performance and precise and scientific
methods."
The supreme leader called on writers and artists to fill the leisure
time of the young people, saying that with the intellectual promotion
of the young the future of the country would be guaranteed.
