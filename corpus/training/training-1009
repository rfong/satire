Congress, celebrities, condemn Germany for anti-Scientology stance 
A US Congressman introduced a resolution denouncing the German
government's discrimination against US members of the Church of
Scientology, the organization said in a statement Thursday.
Democratic Representative Donald Payne of New York announced the
resolution at a press conference here, flanked by jazz pianist Chick
Corea, musician Isaac Hayes and actress Anne Archer.
"The actions that the German government has taken against me and other
celebrities solely because of our personal beliefs clearly places
Germany in violation of human rights accords," Corea said.
Payne's resolution -- co-sponsored by several other lawmakers -- calls
on the US government "to protect the rights of members of minority
religions in Germany."
The Church of Scientology, which says it has 30,000 members in Germany,
has launched a vast campaign against the German government and what it
describes as discrimination on the basis of religion.
