Canada to Issue New Bills to Bust Counterfeit 
The Bank of Canada will issue new bills in two months to fight
counterfeiters, the bank said Thursday.
"The new series of bills will serve to alleviate fraud," said bank
spokesman Bill Cook. "There will be different security features on the
notes."
The new bills will range from notes of five dollars to 10 dollars.
Police have seized fake money with a face value of 4.4 million Canadian
dollars (about 2.9 million U.S. dollars) so far this year.
