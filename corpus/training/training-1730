Jewish Settlers Block Main West Bank Road to Protest Peace Plan 
Hundreds of Jewish settlers blocked a main highway in the West Bank on
Thursday to protest against plans for an Israeli troop pullback in the
area.
The protest came as some right-wing opposition legislators urged
Israelis to stage disruptive protests against the emerging Israel-PLO
accord on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
``The faithful of Israel should be allowed to take to the streets, set
fire to tires and blockade the airport,'' Rehavam Zeevi, leader of the
far-right Moledet Party, told Israel army radio.
Ron Nachman, head of the West Bank settlement of Ariel, said Israelis
should paralyze the state with acts of civil disobedience.
``A government is obligated to protect its citizens and when it
doesn't, it is abandoning the security of me and my family and friends
who live here,'' Nachman said.
Leaders of the 135,000 Jewish settlers have charged that once Israeli
troops pull out of West Bank towns and are replaced by Palestinian
police, the lives of Israelis will be in danger.
Settler leaders have warned that they would shoot to kill if threatened
by Palestinian police.
In Thursday's protest, settlers drove slowly in a convoy along the road
linking the West Bank settlement of Karnei Shomron and the Israeli town
of Kfar Saba.
The protest caused a rush hour traffic jam.
