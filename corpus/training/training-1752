Egypt's FM to attend signing of peace treaty 
Foreign Minister Amr Mussa on Saturday accepted an invitation to attend
the signing of the historic peace treaty between Jordan and Israel, the
Jordanian ambassador said.
Nayef al-Qady, quoted by the official Egyptian news agency MENA, said
he extended the invitation to Mussa and the foreign minister accepted.
The signing ceremony is to take place on Wednesday on the
Jordanian-Israeli border, with US President Bill Clinton among those
attending the ceremony.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has criticized a land leasing aspect
of the peace deal and complained last week that he had only heard of
the treaty, already initialled in Amman, through Israel and not its
fellow Arab country.
No Arab head of state would attend the signing, said Mubarak.
Egypt is the only other Arab state to have made peace with Israel. The
two countries signed their peace treaty in 1979.
