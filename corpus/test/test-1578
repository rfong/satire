Dollar mixed, gold up 
The dollar was mixed in early morning trading here Thursday, losing
ground against the German mark due to profit-taking but staying firm
against the Japanese yen.
Gold, meanwhile, lost 2.00 dollars from Wednesday at 387.00 dollars.
At 10:30 a.m. (1430 GMT), the dollar was trading at 1.4884 German marks
from 1.4930 Wednesday and at 102.55 yen, the same rate as Wednesday. In
London, it was trading at 102.70 yen and 1.4865 German mark.
The US greenback was down against the French and Swiss francs but
firmed against the pound sterling.
It was trading at 5.1244 French francs (5.1135), 1.2123 Swiss francs
(1.2185) and 0.6460 pound sterling (0.6454).
The dollar's strength against the pound sterling was explained by
expectations of a drop in British interest rates following the
announcement of an unexpected drop in retail sales.
Traders tried to shore up the dollar in Asia but sellers stepped in at
the 1.50 German mark level and higher, according to Paul Farrell, a
trader at Chase Manhattan Bank.
"Everyone is trying to drag the dollar-mark (level) with dollar-yen,"
said Farrell, adding that the movement on the money markets was not
related to the dollar but to factors influencing the other currencies.
