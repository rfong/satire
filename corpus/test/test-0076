Indian Parliament Passes Copyright Act 
The Indian parliament Wednesday passed a bill for amending the
Copyright Act, 1957, seeking to extend the term of protecting
performers' rights from 25 years to 50 years with the Lok Sabha (Lower
House) approving it by a voice vote.
The Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1999, already passed by Rajya Sabha
(Upper House), seeks to provide powers to the government to extend the
provision of the Act to broadcasts and performances made in other
countries provided those countries give similar protection to
broadcasts and performances made in India.
Human Resource Development Minister Murli Manohar Joshi stated that the
government was committed to protecting the interests of artists, Indian
culture and literature, adding that India has to adapt to the rapidly
changing global economic and trade scenario.
He said that the amendments would not only protect the interests of
writers, artists and TV and film performers, but also restrict the
rights of foreign broadcasting organizations and performers.
