Japan welcomes Sri Lanka truce, hopes for peace talks 
Japan Saturday welcomed a truce in Sri Lanka between government forces
and Tamil Tiger guerrillas and expressed the hope for early peace talks
in the embattled nation.
The Japanese embassy here in a statement said that Tokyo hoped the
truce that is due to go into effect from Christmas Eve will help create
an environment for peace negotiations.
"The government of Japan strongly hopes ... that the actual
negotiations will commence at the earliest possible date in order to
realise the collective will of the people for peace which was shown in
the general election this year," the embassy quoted Japan's foreign
ministry spokesman Norio Hattori as saying.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe came to power following the
December 5 elections on a promise to restore peace by opening talks
with the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
The guerrillas announced a unilateral truce and the Colombo government
said it will reciprocate and also lift an economic embargo on
rebel-held areas of the island's north.
The Japanese statement came as Wickremesinghe left for India to open
talks with his counterpart there, Atal Behari Vajpayee, on seeking New
Delhi's support to open talks with Tiger rebels.
On Friday, Britain's Foreign Minister Jack Straw said the month-long
truce from Christmas Eve was an opportunity for both parties in Sri
Lanka to work towards a solution meeting the aspirations of all
communities.
"This is an excellent opportunity for all concerned to work together to
renew the peace process," Straw said. "I hope this will be a genuine
ceasefire that will be maintained."
