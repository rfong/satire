Vuyelwa/NNP Nomaza/NNP Paintin/NNP ,/, 51/CD ,/, who/WP described/VBD her/PRP$ occupation/NN as/IN ``/`` homemaker/NN ''/'' ,/, had/VBD last/JJ month/NN entered/VBD no/DT plea/NN to/TO the/DT charge/NN that/IN on/IN April/NNP 25/CD at/IN Wellington/NNP she/PRP made/VBD a/DT false/JJ declaration/NN that/IN she/PRP was/VBD born/VBN in/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP ,/, when/WRB in/IN fact/NN she/PRP had/VBD been/VBN born/VBN in/IN what/WP was/VBD then/RB Rhodesia/NNP ,/, now/RB Zimbabwe/NNP ./.

If/IN found/VBD guilty/JJ she/PRP could/MD face/VB a/DT maximum/JJ three/CD years/NNS in/IN jail/NN ,/, although/IN people/NNS here/RB are/VBP seldom/RB jailed/VBN for/IN such/JJ offences/NNS ./.

On/IN her/PRP$ latest/JJS appearance/NN she/PRP again/RB made/VBD no/DT plea/NN and/CC the/DT case/NN was/VBD adjourned/VBN to/TO August/NNP 25/CD ./.

Paintin/NNP was/VBD the/DT first/JJ person/NN to/TO vote/VB in/IN the/DT South/NNP African/JJ elections/NNS because/IN world/NN time-zones/NNS meant/VBD a/DT special/JJ voting/NN station/NN here/RB was/VBD the/DT first/JJ to/TO open/VB ./.

She/PRP was/VBD greeted/VBN outside/IN the/DT polling/NN venue/NN by/IN Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Jim/NNP Bolger/NNP and/CC pictures/NNS of/IN her/PRP$ voting/NN went/VBD around/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

Bolger/NNP later/RB gave/VBD Mandela/NNP a/DT framed/JJ copy/NN of/IN the/DT picture/NN ./.

Two/CD months/NNS ago/RB Television/NNP New/NNP Zealand/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- TVNZ/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- revealed/VBD her/PRP$ vote/NN had/VBD not/RB counted/VBN because/IN she/PRP was/VBD not/RB South/NNP African/NNP ,/, but/CC Zimbabwean/JJ ./.

It/PRP also/RB said/VBD that/IN while/IN Paintin/NNP claimed/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT doctor/NN and/CC a/DT diplomat/NN ,/, she/PRP was/VBD neither/RB ,/, and/CC that/IN her/PRP$ relationship/NN to/TO Mandela/NNP was/VBD only/RB very/RB distant/JJ ./.

TVNZ/NNP called/VBD her/PRP a/DT ``/`` complete/JJ sham/NN ''/'' with/IN a/DT long/JJ history/NN of/IN fabrication/NN ./.

Last/JJ week/NN Paintin/NNP told/VBD TVNZ/NNP it/PRP was/VBD not/RB important/JJ to/TO her/PRP whether/IN the/DT actual/JJ vote/NN had/VBD counted/VBN or/CC not/RB ./.

``/`` I/PRP was/VBD the/DT first/JJ person/NN to/TO vote/VB and/CC you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB take/VB that/DT away/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP voted/VBD spiritually/RB for/IN my/PRP$ grandparents/NNS and/CC my/PRP$ father/NN ./.

So/CC what/WP everybody/NN says/VBZ about/IN it/PRP being/VBG invalid/JJ is/VBZ not/RB important/JJ to/TO me/PRP ,/, but/CC I/PRP did/VBD it/PRP ,/, with/IN great/JJ passion/NN ./. ''/''

Although/IN she/PRP claimed/VBD to/TO have/VB been/VBN born/VBN in/IN Transkei/NNP her/PRP$ mother/NN told/VBD TVNZ/NNP she/PRP had/VBD been/VBN born/VBN in/IN Harare/NNP ,/, Zimbabwe/NNP ,/, and/CC had/VBD never/RB been/VBN to/TO South/NNP Africa/NNP ./.
