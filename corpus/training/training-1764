Arsenal deny Brolin bid 
Arsenal have denied making a bid for Swedish World Cup star Thomas
Brolin.
Rumours have been rife all week that the London Premiership club were
chasing the striker, who is out of contract with Italian club Parma,
and available for 2.8 million pounds.
But Gunners boss George Graham said on Friday: "Brolin is not for us.
The story was a complete flyer and he won't be coming to Highbury."
Graham has already signed Brolin's international team-mate Stefan
Schwarz from Portuguese giants Benfica.
