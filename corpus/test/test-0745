Shas Party Leader Quits Parliament 
In a bid to find a place in the new government for his party, Aryeh
Deri, leader of Israel's powerful religious Shas Party, Tuesday
announced that he quitted the Knesset (parliament).
At a news conference in Jerusalem, Deri said that he will not lead the
negotiations with the left-wing "One Israel" on forming a coalition
government as well.
But Deri said that he would remain as the leader of the party.
Deri made the decision after his Shas party won 17 seats in the
120-member Knesset in Monday's general elections, an amazing growth
from 10 seats in the last Knesset.
Ehud Barak, leader of the "One Israel" coalition, won a landslide
victory over the incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
Monday's elections.
Barak has said that he would not conduct coalition negotiations with
Deri, since the Shas leader was convicted of bribery and fraud charges
and sentenced to four years in jail just before the elections.
Following the elections, Barak has 45 days to form a coalition and
submit it to the Knesset.
Barak has said that he wanted to form a broad-based coalition, which
may include religious or right-wing parties.
