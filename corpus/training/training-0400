Zambia Reports Serious Shortage of Teachers 
Zambia is facing a serious shortage of more than 15,000 trained
teachers, the "Sunday Times of Zambia" newspaper reported today.
It quoted Permanent Secretary of the Education Ministry Sichalwe
Kasanda as saying that there are about 38,500 trained primary school
teachers and only about 7,600 trained secondary school teachers in the
country.
He said the continuous shortage of teachers is forcing the ministry to
recruit untrained teachers, whose numbers now stand at 9,000 for
primary schools and 6,000 for secondary schools.
The official said the ministry has awarded a hardship allowance to
encourage urban teachers to serve in rural areas.
