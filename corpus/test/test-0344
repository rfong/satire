Stars and Stripes (11-9, 32): Dennis Conner's team was only 1-3 in the
final round and there are doubts that the design is up to Young
America. But Stars and Stripes will be getting new sails for the
semi-finals. Conner still has the ability to win the big ones. Edge on
Young America could still be the battle-hardened crew.
Mighty Mary (5-15, 21): The "radically fast" new boat promised by
America3 boss Bill Koch didn't look radically fast in its fourth-round
debut, although women split with both men's teams. Entering the
semi-finals without a bonus win is a big penalty. After being courteous
to the women during the first three rounds, the gloves seemed to be
coming off in the fourth round.
