Argentina Posts Trade Deficit in First Seven Months 
Argentina registered a 1.86 billion dollar trade deficit during the
first seven months of this year, said the National Institute of
Statistics and Census today.
Imports jumped 28 percent over the corresponding previous period to
16.59 billion dollars, while exports rose only 9 percent to reach 14.73
billion dollars.
However, the country posted a 1.2 billion dollar trade surplus with its
partners in the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
Mercosur, the biggest trade bloc in South America, groups Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Bolivia and Chile being associate
members.
