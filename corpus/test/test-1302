One killed in alleged Indian firing on Pakistani Kashmir 
A woman was killed and two other people were seriously injured when
Indian troops opened "indiscriminate" fire on border villages in the
Pakistani-administered part of Kashmir, official sources said Sunday.
The Indian troops on Saturday resorted to mortar and small arms attack
at several places along the line of control that divides the northern
Himalayan state into Indian and Pakistani administered zones, the
official Associated Press of Pakistan said.
It said a woman was killed in the Garam Chashma area while two men
suffered serious injuries in Hajipir and Keran sectors.
The agency said Pakistan had lodged complaints about these ceasefire
violations with United Nations military observers.
Since they obtained independence from Britain in 1947, India and
Pakistan have fought two of their three wars for control of Kashmir.
The state was divided after their first war in 1948.
Pakistan controls the northern third of the state while the southern
region is held by India.
Relations between the mutually hostile neighbours have become tense
amid a bloody separatist campaign launched by Kashmiri militants in the
Indian-administered zone.
India, which has rejected the 1949 UN resolution for a plebiscite in
the state, accuses Pakistan of training and arming the Kashmiri
militants.
Pakistan denies the charge but has vowed to continue political and
diplomatic support to what it calls the Kashmiris' "legitimate
struggle" for their right to self-determination.
