Malaysia to Launch Education Savings Scheme 
Malaysia is to launch an Education Savings Scheme next year to which
parents can make a monthly contribution from the time their child
enters primary school.
Announcing the scheme here Monday, Chairman of the National Higher
Education Fund Corporation Husni Hanadziah said that if a parent saves
100 ringgit (about 25 U.S. dollars) a month with the scheme from the
time their child enters primary school, the money plus interest will
add up to about 20,000 ringgit (about 5,000 U.S. dollars) 11 years
later.
"The money can be used to finance his higher education for at least
four years," he said after attending the opening of an art exhibition
here.
Husni said there is no compulsion to save with the scheme and the money
could be withdrawn at any time or if the student did not enter any
institution of higher learning.
The corporation would collaborate with a local bank to implement the
scheme nationwide, he said.
Husni was convinced that the scheme would be welcomed by parents who
are now more committed to matters pertaining to their children's
education.
