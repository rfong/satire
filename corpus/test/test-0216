Mechancial problem causes plane switch for Clinton: security officials 
US President Bill Clinton switched planes for a flight to Canberra on
Wednesday after a presidential Boeing 707 developed mechanical
problems, security officials said.
Clinton and his wife Hillary used a Boeing 747 from the US Air Force
fleet of aircraft for the flight to the national capital where he is to
have talks with Prime Minister John Howard and address a joint sitting
of parliament.
The 707 was warming up its engines on the tarmac at Kingsford Smith
airport in the Mascot suburb when police and White House aides rushed
over to the aircraft.
Security officials told media at the airport there had been a
mechanical fault with the 707 but they would give no other details.
Witnesses said there was no obvious sign of a problem with the
aircraft.
The US party was on the road to the airport for the 45-minute trip when
the switch was made.
