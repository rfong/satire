London stocks up 0.83 percent at lunch-time 
London stocks continued to scale the heights on Thursday, encouraged
mainly by Wall Street's performance on Thursday and by some reassuring
by US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, traders said at lunch-time.
The Footsie index stood at 1235 GMT at 4,396.7 points, up 36.6 points
or 0.83 percent to its highest level ever as trading continued.
The morning had featured publication of results by some important
companies on the market.
Glaxo Wellcome was off 6 pence to 1029, remaining on a downtrend due to
negative comment by merchant bank Goldman Sachs, despite announcement
of a pretax result last year of 2.9 billion pounds.
Among other firms presenting results, Rolls Royce gained 15 pence to
trade at 254.
After a big win over Porto in the European Cup, Manchester United
football club was up 18 pence to 665.
