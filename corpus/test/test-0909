N. Zealand Expected to Make Tough Response to Fiji
It quoted New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark as saying Fiji should
expect a "pretty tough" response after choosing to abandon its 1997
Constitution and give in to the demands of coup leader George Speight.
According to earlier reports, Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs, the
country's traditional powerful body, has endorsed Speight's demand to
overthrow the nation's Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and agreed to
amend the Constitution, pardon all those who participated in the coup
and include Speight into a new government.
Clark said the council's proposal is unacceptable and would not be
tolerated by the international community.
"There can be no acceptance internationally of an outcome which defies
constitutional processes," she said.
She added that what the council had proposed would deny normal
democratic rights to the minority Indian population there.
"Fiji has to be aware that the path it is on of denying the normal
democratic rights to a minority because of their race is utterly
unacceptable," the prime minister said.
The New Zealand Government is understood to be looking at a range of
options, from recalling the New Zealand High Commission to imposing
trade, tourism and sports sanctions.
It is reported that New Zealand could block preferential trade access
for Fijian goods coming into New Zealand or slash the annual about 2.5
million U.S. dollars Fiji receives from New Zealand in official
development aid.
