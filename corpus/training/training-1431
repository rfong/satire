Diana was sabotaging London's 2012 Olympic bid
Paul Burrell, professional self publicist and sometime butler to the
stars, has made another stunning revelation to the Diana inquest.
Burrell told lawyers that he had secret letters showing that Diana was
sabotaging the London 2012 Olympic bid to make sure that Paris won.
"That was why she was in Paris that night. That was why she had to go.
All of the talk about heart surgeon lovers is just a diversion by the
News at Ten."
The judge asked how Diana was planning to sabotage the bid. Burrell's
answer revealed that the princess was actually an expert in VAT
legislation: "Having looked at the early budget proposals realised that
they were ludicrously low because VAT had not been factored in. She was
about to blow the whistle - and had faxed the papers to say she had a
big announcement.
"Of course the secret services hijacked the story and watered down her
supposed revelations saying that she was merely going to announce she
was pregnant or going to marry Dodi."
