Saudi man suffocates in bid for freedom 
An elderly Saudi suffocated to death as he tried to escape from the
Gulf kingdom to Egypt in a steel container on board an Egyptian ship,
the government daily Al-Ahram said Sunday.
Officers at the Egyptian port of Suez discovered the man's decomposing
body in the chest on board the Al-Arish ship which set off from Jeddah
in Saudi Arabia.
The man, who was in his 80s, had been locked in the 75-centimetre high
container by a friend in a bid to escape from the Saudi authorities,
Al-Ahram said.
He had with him a hammer and special steel-cutters as well as a
ventilator, a bag of apples and water, but luggage piled on top of the
chest prevented him from getting out once the boat had set off.
