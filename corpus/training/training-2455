Liberian Faction Leader Explains Absence From ECOWAS Summit 
Liberia's faction leader Charles Taylor Wednesday attributed his
absence at the summit of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) to concern for his personal safety as the United States
defends its role in the war-torn country.
Taylor, who sent a 30-man delegation to the summit, which began
yesterday in Nigerian capital Abuja, said on behalf of the National
Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) that +something can come out of the
meeting+.
On allegations that he was getting moral and material support from Cote
d'Ivoire, he said Abidjan +has kept its hands clean and in fact our
officials travel into Cote d'Ivoire only by permission,+ according to
local newspapers today.
He blamed Nigeria for the delay in implementing the peace process,
saying he was not expecting the heads of state of ECOWAS to negotiate
an agreement for liberia.
+I do not think that this is what they intend to do because they've
always said it's up to the Liberias to come up with their own
agreement,+ Taylor said.
Asked whether he would support the ECOWAS leaders if they agree to
police Liberia's border with Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire, Taylor
said ,+I do not think that any sound person would accept a situation,
where Alhaji Kromah (another Liberian faction leader) and Captain
Valentine Strasser (Sierra Leonean Head of State) can import arms into
this country and support groups here (Liberia) and then continue to
complain about Cote d'Ivoire+.
