Confident Indurain In Customary Place Going Into Mountains
Big Mig won big this weekend. The mountains looming on the Tour de
France horizon will tell whether it was big enough.
With clockwork precision, Miguel Indurain dealt his rivals major
setbacks over two stifling days through Belgium's hills and kept his
challenge for an unprecedented fifth straight Tour win well alive.
``I made sure I have a decent margin over (Tony) Rominger and (Evgueni)
Berzin,'' Indurain said of his two main rivals after winning Sunday's
time trial to take the yellow jersey for the overall lead.
``Now I await the climbers,'' he said, anticipating three days of
Alpine stages and eight huge mountain climbs following Monday's rest
day.
Indurain's show of force put climbing specialists Marco Pantani of
Italy and France's Richard Virenque already minutes back and seemingly
out of reckoning before hitting their favored terrain.
Surprising to most, Dane Bjarne Riis, a teammate of Berzin, is
Indurain's closest challenger after the first week of the Tour,
trailing by only 23 seconds.
``Nobody believed I could do it. Only me and my wife,'' said Riis, 31.
The Dane even threatened Indurain's five-year reign over the first long
time trial of the Tour.
Indurain had to come back from behind in the final five kilometers (3
miles) to edge Riis by a mere 12 seconds over 54 kilometers (33.5
miles) to finish in 1 hour 4:16 minutes.
``I knew he would be very strong,'' said Indurain of Riis. And even
though Riis is not specifically known as a climber, his fifth place
overall in the 1993 Tour proves he has staying power.
``I've put my whole season on the Tour this year,'' Riis said. ``I hope
I can follow the best in the mountains,'' he said.
Although the win in the first long time trial was not as devastating as
the previous four years, Indurain heads into the Alps with a lead
topping two minutes over his main rivals.
Berzin trails by 2:20 minutes overall and Rominger by 2:32.
``The Tour is still an open challenge,'' said Indurain. ``Two tough
weeks remain.''
On Saturday, Indurain already made a big move in a breakaway with
Belgian Johan Bruyneel, leaving his main challengers over a minute
behind.
When the Tour ends in Paris on July 23, Indurain hopes to join Belgian
Eddy Merckx Frenchmen Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault as five-time
winner. Indurain is the first who can do it in straight years.
