Costa Rican Supreme Court limits oil exploration 
The Costa Rica Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the law
governing oil exploration contracts on Tuesday, opening the way for
citizens to sue over environmental damages.
An environmental advocacy group, the Justice for Nature Association,
argued that the law denied citizens the constitutional guarantee to a
clean environment. Under Article 41 of the Hydrocarbon Law, the
government could grant licenses prior to the filing of an environmental
impact study by the exploration company.
The court finding is retroactive, nullifying any contract made under
its provisions except a controversial contract granting US-based Harken
Costa Rican Holdings rights to explore on Costa Rica's Caribbean shore.
In limbo is a contract to be signed with US-based Mallon Oil permitting
exploration on the north of Costa Rica.
