NATO's first dog of war prompts formation of new K9 para regiment
Washington DC - (Shaggy Dog Mess): A top secret NATO bugging operation
that planted a wired pooch into the Oval Orifice has been hailed as
immensely successful.
Scores of new mutts will now be dropped into various other global
hellholes.
Recruits to the newly formed K9 Para Regiment will be trained to jump
out of planes at 25,000 feet.
They are expert in sniffing out assholes, nuclear warheads and
searching confined spaces.
"We're starting by sending Afghan Hounds into Kabul to bug the hell
outta that Bush client-dictator Hamid Karzai," a top NATO military
intelligence source commented today.
"We also figure Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe might just fall for a bull
mastiff called Tsvangerai that's trained to salute each time his new
master enters a room."
There'll be no pooch however for Iran's nutter President Ahmadinejad
because local customs dictate canines are 'demon filth'.
"Hell, we bugged his ass years ago," the NATO source shrugged.
