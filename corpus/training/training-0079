Stock Market Opens Higher 
Stocks firmed at the opening Friday morning as a U.S. gross domestic
product report came in line with analysts' expectations and pushed bond
prices higher.
At 10.30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks was up 7.74 to 3,878.18 after one hour of trading.
Advancing issues led decliners by about 11 to 4 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Big Board volume came to 46.59 million shares in the first
half hour.
The Commerce Department said the nation's gross domestic product, the
sum of all the goods and services produced, rose 4.5 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1994, just shy of analysts' estimates of a 4.6
percent increase.
Analysts and investors were looking to the GDP number for some clue
about whether the economy is growing at an inflationary pace. Any signs
of inflation could encourage the Federal Reserve to increase short-term
interest rates at its policy meeting that convenes next Tuesday.
Thomas Brown, market strategist at Rutherford, Brown and Catherwood,
said the GDP data could support earlier hopes that if the Fed does
tighten next week, ``it will be the last time'' in this economic cycle.
The GDP report, which showed that inflation may be under control,
pushed bonds higher. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was up about dlrs 7
per dlrs 1,000 face value. Its yield, which falls when prices rise,
stood at 7.76 percent, down from 7.84 percent on Thursday.
In the stock market, broad indexes were higher. The NYSE composite
index was up 1.18 at 256.10 in the first 30 minutes. Standard and
Poor's 500 index was up 2.29 at 470.61. The American Stock Exchange's
market value index was up 0.81 at 438.55. The Nasdaq composite was up
2.50 at 760.06.
Overseas stock markets were higher in overnight trading. Tokyo's Nikkei
index gained 0.2 percent, while the DAX index in Frankfurt added 0.1
percent. In London, the FT-SE 100 index was up 0.44 percent.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones average lost 1.01 points in sluggish trading
ahead of the GDP report, though some other market indexes rose.
