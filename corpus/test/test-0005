Actor Carroll O'Connor Blames Drugs For Son's Suicide 
Hours after Carroll O'Connor's son committed suicide, police arrested
the man whom the actor accused of selling drugs to his son.
Harry Thomas Perzigian was booked for investigation of cocaine
possession Wednesday, the day after Hugh Edward O'Connor shot himself
to death. The booking charge was changed to possession for sale after
police seized what appeared to be more than an ounce of cocaine, along
with drug paraphernalia and dlrs 1,700 cash, police said.
``We located some cocaine in a toilet that apparently was attempted to
be flushed by him,'' said Lt. Bernie Larralde.
Perzigian, 39, posted dlrs 15,000 bail Wednesday afternoon.
O'Connor, 32, who appeared on his father's TV show ``In The Heat of the
Night,'' killed himself with a gunshot to the head Tuesday night.
Afterward, his father tearfully told reporters that Perzigian supplied
drugs to his only child.
``These dealers, they kill people,'' O'Connor said outside his son's
home in Pacific Palisades. ``They make a living giving people the means
to kill themselves. Harry, I want to see you someday.''
The 71-year-old actor best known for playing the bigoted working-class
Archie Bunker in ``All In The Family'' had called police earlier
Tuesday, saying his son was despondent and had access to guns.
A crisis negotiator and special weapons team were dispatched to the
son's home, but the younger O'Connor told them to go away and he shot
himself. Police said they found a suicide note.
Hugh O'Connor's death came on his third wedding anniversary. Besides
his father, he is survived by his wife, Angela Clayton; their
2-year-old son, Sean; and his mother, O'Connor's wife, Nancy.
O'Connor said he wondered whether it wouldn't be better to legalize
drugs. ``It's not going to create more addicts,'' he said. ``It's just
going to put the crooks and criminals and killers out of business.''
Hugh O'Connor played Lt. Lonnie Jamison on the CBS series ``In the Heat
of the Night,'' which stars his father as a Mississippi sheriff.
A funeral was scheduled in Los Angeles on Saturday, but the rites will
be private.
