Britain/NNP launches/VBZ ``/`` revolution/NN ''/'' in/IN pensions/NNS As/IN countries/NNS across/IN Europe/NNP grapple/VB with/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN how/WRB to/TO fund/VB the/DT pensions/NNS of/IN rapidly/RB ageing/JJ populations/NNS ,/, Britain/NNP may/MD be/VB leading/VBG the/DT way/NN with/IN a/DT radical/JJ plan/NN to/TO privatize/VB the/DT state/NN pensions/NNS system/NN ./.

Unveiling/VBG an/DT initiative/NN to/TO replace/VB state/NN pensions/NNS over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ decades/NNS with/IN privately-funded/JJ retirement/NN schemes/NNS ,/, Conservative/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP John/NNP Major/NNP declared/VBD he/PRP was/VBD heralding/VBG a/DT ``/`` revolution/NN ./. ''/''

Throughout/IN Europe/NNP ,/, the/DT present/JJ system/NN of/IN state/NN pensions/NNS ,/, under/IN which/WDT today/NN 's/POS workers/NNS support/VBP those/DT in/IN retirement/NN ,/, is/VBZ approaching/VBG a/DT crisis/NN next/JJ century/NN ,/, when/WRB there/EX will/MD be/VB insufficient/JJ people/NNS in/IN work/NN to/TO pay/VB for/IN the/DT pensions/NNS of/IN growing/VBG numbers/NNS of/IN old/JJ people/NNS ./.

In/IN contrast/NN to/TO other/JJ European/JJ countries/NNS ,/, private/JJ pension/NN schemes/NNS are/VBP already/RB commonplace/JJ in/IN Britain/NNP and/CC run/VBN alongside/IN the/DT state-funded/JJ safety/NN net/NN ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP still/RB fears/NNS that/IN the/DT current/JJ system/NN might/MD place/VB an/DT impossible/JJ burden/NN on/IN the/DT workforce/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT 1980s/NNS ,/, former/JJ Conservative/JJ prime/JJ minister/NN Margaret/NNP Thatcher/NNP 's/POS mass/JJ privatization/NN program/NN inspired/VBD Latin/JJ American/JJ governments/NNS to/TO sell/VB off/RP their/PRP$ loss-making/JJ state/NN enterprises/NNS in/IN later/JJ years/NNS ./.

This/DT time/NN ,/, the/DT roles/NNS were/VBD reversed/VBN :/: the/DT inspiration/NN for/IN the/DT Conservative/JJ plan/NN came/VBD from/IN Chile/NNP ,/, where/WRB in/IN 1981/CD the/DT Chilean/JJ dictator/NN ,/, General/NNP Pinochet/NNP ,/, privatized/VBZ the/DT country/NN 's/POS near-bankrupt/JJ state/NN pension/NN system/NN ./.

Like/IN the/DT Chilean/JJ model/NN ,/, the/DT British/JJ system/NN would/MD be/VB compulsory/JJ ,/, but/CC unlike/IN in/IN Chile/NNP ,/, the/DT Conservatives/NNS do/VBP intend/VB to/TO guarantee/VB a/DT basic/JJ pension/NN paid/VBN by/IN the/DT state/NN for/IN the/DT unemployed/JJ and/CC other/JJ disadvantaged/JJ people/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT will/MD be/VB pegged/VBN at/IN today/NN 's/POS basic/JJ state/NN pension/NN of/IN 61.15/CD pounds/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 98.50/CD dollars/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- per/IN week/NN ,/, index-linked/VBN to/TO inflation/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD not/RB provide/VB even/RB a/DT minimum/JJ standard/NN of/IN living/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT snag/NN ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN provision/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT guaranteed/VBN minimum/NN would/MD be/VB so/RB low/JJ ,/, after/IN the/DT changes/NNS since/IN 1979/CD ,/, as/IN to/TO make/VB the/DT safety/NN net/NN safe/JJ only/RB for/IN ascetics/JJ ,/, ''/'' the/DT Financial/NNP Times/NNP business/NN daily/NN pointed/VBD out/RP in/IN an/DT editorial/NN ./.

The/DT Conservative/JJ party/NN is/VBZ widely/RB expected/VBN to/TO lose/VB national/JJ elections/NNS due/JJ by/IN May/NNP 1/CD ,/, but/CC the/DT main/JJ opposition/NN Labor/NN party/NN is/VBZ still/RB expected/VBN to/TO embrace/VB the/DT idea/NN that/IN private/JJ pensions/NNS should/MD be/VB given/VBN a/DT bigger/JJR role/NN ./.

Labor/NNP 's/POS Social/NNP security/NN spokesman/NN ,/, Harriet/NNP Harman/NNP ,/, said/VBD the/DT party/NN would/MD ``/`` look/VB carefully/RB ''/'' at/IN the/DT proposals/NNS ,/, but/CC criticized/VBD the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP would/MD mean/VB ``/`` the/DT end/NN of/IN state/NN pensions/NNS ./. ''/''

Under/IN the/DT Conservative/JJ plan/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD be/VB phased/VBN in/IN from/IN around/RB 2002/CD to/TO 2040/CD for/IN young/JJ people/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ early/JJ 20s/NNS ,/, employees/NNS would/MD be/VB exempt/JJ from/IN payments/NNS currently/RB used/VBN to/TO support/VB those/DT claiming/VBG state/NN retirement/NN benefits/NNS ./.

This/DT money/NN would/MD be/VB ploughed/VBN into/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ personal/JJ retirement/NN funds/NNS managed/VBN by/IN pension/NN funds/NNS approved/VBN by/IN the/DT government/NN ./.

Social/NNP Security/NNP Secretary/NNP ,/, Peter/NNP Lilley/NNP ,/, said/VBD that/IN a/DT person/NN on/IN average/JJ earnings/NNS could/MD expect/VB to/TO build/VB up/RP a/DT fund/NN of/IN 130,000/CD pounds/NNS ,/, which/WDT would/MD pay/VB a/DT pension/NN of/IN 175/CD pounds/NNS a/DT week/NN ./.

Lilley/NNP said/VBD that/IN in/IN the/DT longer-term/JJ ,/, the/DT government/NN could/MD save/VB 40/CD billion/CD pounds/NNS a/DT year/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN state/NN pensions/NNS fell/VBD to/TO around/RB 10/CD billion/CD pounds/NNS a/DT year/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, Labor/NNP estimates/VBZ that/IN the/DT cumulative/JJ bill/NN for/IN introducing/VBG the/DT system/NN would/MD run/VB to/TO 150/CD billion/CD pounds/NNS ,/, because/IN the/DT state/NN would/MD continue/VB to/TO provide/VB state/NN pensions/NNS to/TO the/DT existing/VBG population/NN ,/, but/CC would/MD not/RB receive/VB funds/NNS from/IN new/JJ entrants/NNS to/TO the/DT jobs/NNS market/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ also/RB concern/NN about/IN the/DT poor/JJ track-record/NN of/IN the/DT pension/NN industry/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN accused/VBN of/IN charging/VBG exorbitant/JJ administrative/JJ charges/NNS for/IN personal/JJ pensions/NNS ./.
