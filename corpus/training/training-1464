Arafat arrives for talks with Mubarak 
PLO chief Yasser Arafat arrived here Tuesday for talks with President
Hosni Mubarak on the situation facing the peace process after two
suicide bombings in Gaza that killed eight people.
As he arrived, his Palestinian Authority announced that it would disarm
hardline militants trying to wreck the peace process.
The suicide bombings, carried out by hardline opponents of the peace
deal, on Sunday killed six Israeli soldiers and wounded 54 other
people. Another Israeli and an American woman died later in hospital.
