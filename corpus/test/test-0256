Chunnel freight shuttles to resume, with improved safety 
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel said Thursday it is to resume
shuttle services for freight trucks by mid-June, with improved safety
measures seven months after a blaze in the tunnel.
The consortium said repair work on the tunnel would be completed by
mid-May, as planned, and that new security procedures and equipment
would be introduced before the resumption of freight services.
The cause of the November 18 blaze is still not known, a statement
said, but added that a technical fault had been ruled out.
New security measures will include improvements in monitoring the
loading of trucks onto shuttle carriages at the two ends of the tunnel,
the statement said.
The truck on which the blaze started was already on fire before it
entered the tunnel at the French end. Investigations have centred on
how this was not noticed until the train was well inside the tunnel.
Oxygen masks would also be provided in carriages which carry truck
drivers -- separated from their vehicles in the tunnel -- after many of
those caught in the November blaze suffered severe smoke inhalation.
In the November blaze, 34 passengers and crew had to be evacuated when
a fire broke out on a lorry being transported on a freight shuttle.
The fire in the 50.5-kilometre (31.5-mile) rail link under the English
Channel was the worst crisis to affect the so-called "Chunnel" since
its 1994 opening.
Eurotunnel said Thursday that new equipment will also improve
officials' ability to pinpoint the location of a stopped train inside
the tunnel, while better firefighting equipment will be fitted in the
tunnel by 1999.
Its statement said the rescue operation on November 18 had been carried
out within timeframe set out in the company's safety guidelines.
But it admitted there had been "certain delays in implementing
procedures, due either to the complexity of some of them, or
communication problems of a technical and human nature."
The trains carrying freight trucks through the Franco-British
underwater link have been suspended since the fire.
Eurostar passenger strains resumed through the tunnel a few weeks after
the blaze, followed by Le Shuttle services for cars in December.
The resumption of freight truck services has to approved by a
Franco-British supervisory body which recommended safety improvements
in the wake of the blaze.
