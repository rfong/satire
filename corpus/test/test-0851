Serbs Declare Fall of Second `Safe Area'
Heaping scorn on Western peace efforts, rebel Serbs have declared
control of a second Muslim ``safe area'' and laid ground for another
flood of refugees Thursday.
The deal Wednesday to give up Zepa to the besieging Serbs seemed to
have been cut by local civilians without formal approval of the army
and the government in Sarajevo. But by Thursday it seemed accepted by
most people, including President Alija Izetbegovic.
``It is our understanding that the Bosnian president appeared to accept
that Zepa had in fact fallen,'' U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko told
reporters.
He said the intensity of fighting in the enclave had eased, and the
Sarajevo government had asked the United Nations to provide security
for the thousands of Muslims the Serbs plan to expell.
Capture of the remote mountainous enclave southeast of Sarajevo widens
Serb control over a strategic swath of land between the capital and the
Serbian border.
The weakly defended enclave had been expected to fall since rebel Serbs
last week seized the larger ``safe area'' of Srebrenica, to the north.
The loss of Zepa dealt another blow to the morale of Bosnian government
forces and the United Nations, which had set up and promised to defend
the ``safe areas.''
Boastful Serbs hinted that they want to use the conquest to dictate
terms for a settlement. Bosnian Serb spokesman Jovan Zametica said
``the international community should help provide a realistic framework
for a negotiated settlement.''
``The Serbs are amazed by the international community's capacity for
self-deception. The international community is sick, and it needs help.
We, the Serbs, intend to sober it up,'' Zametica told The Associated
Press.
The fall of Zepa leaves just one more ``safe area'' _ Gorazde _ in the
strategically important eastern region coveted by rebel Serbs in their
more than three-year war against the Muslim-led government.
Zepa has an estimated 10,000 to 16,000 civilians, although the Serbs
claim there are only 7,000 in all.
At the United Nations, Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey said
the fall of Zepa would mean ``another 15,000 to 20,000 people who are
going to be subjected to the worst types of abuses, murder and rape.''
It also has 79 Ukrainian peacekeepers, whom both sides have threatened
to use as hostages in recent days.
The condition of the peacekeepers was unclear. Most of their radios and
all but four of their vehicles were seized by advancing Serbs,
according to U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard at U.N. headquarters in New
York.
``They have only one radio and the Serbs have been jamming the
broadcasts periodically, so that our communications with the Ukrainians
are limited,'' Eckhard said.
In a statement Wednesday, the Bosnian Serb army headquarters said Zepa
civilian representatives Hamdija Torlak and Benjamin Kulovac had
``accepted surrender conditions'' during a meeting with the Bosnian
Serb commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, Wednesday evening.
The Muslim civilians, waving a white flag, met with rebel Serb forces
and sealed the surrender by accepting ``cigarettes and liquor,'' said
Bosnian Serb army spokesman Milovan Milutinovic.
The sides agreed to evacuate 30 wounded people Thursday at 10 a.m.
(0800 GMT). Others would leave starting at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) Thursday
under U.N. military escort, the statement said. Bosnian Serbs Thursday
said the 30 medical evacuees would be accompanied by about 30 relatives
and head for Sarajevo.
Healthy women, children and men of non-fighting age were to be expelled
to Kladanj, a government-held town through which the thousands of
Muslims expelled from Srebrenica also traveled en route to Tuzla, the
statement said.
Ivanko said the Serbs were planning to hold all men between 18
and 55 for prisoner exchanges with the Bosnian army.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns called for
immediate access to Zepa by humanitarian organizations to ensure a
neutral accounting of the civilian population.
``Their evacuation must be in accordance with international
humanitarian law and be monitored by neutral observers,'' Burns said.
The capture claim by the Bosnian Serb supreme command came eight days
after the fall of Srebrenica.
Some 23,000 Srebrenica refugees fled to the north-central town of
Tuzla, bringing horrendous tales of atrocities. Another 4,000 men
fought their way through Serb-held territory to Tuzla, but the fate of
some 11,000 others was still unclear.
Senior Western leaders and U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali are meeting
in London Friday to consider beefing up U.N. forces to protect
remaining ``safe areas.''
A French proposal to intervene to protect Gorazde and break the Serb
stranglehold on Sarajevo apparently hasn't won support from the United
States or Britain. France has the most peacekeepers in Bosnia.
The Clinton administration proposed stepping up NATO airstrikes against
the Serbs _ without the U.N. approval now needed. President Clinton
telephoned French and British leaders Wednesday to push for the plan,
said White House press secretary Mike McCurry.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic warned against foreign involvement
in Gorazde, saying that ``whoever sides militarily with the Muslims
must be aware that this would mean a war against the Serbs.''
