``I've been a lot of places, all over the world,'' the San Francisco
native said on the Olympic Club practice range this week. ``And the San
Joaquin Valley is a pretty nice place to live.''
Springer will turn 29 a week from Thursday and be able to celebrate his
best season as a pro golfer, with victories at Greensboro and
Milwaukee. He has earned $710,717 to stand 10th on the money list going
into the $3 million Tour Championship, which begins tomorrow on the
Lake Course.
``This year a lot of things have fallen into place,'' he said. ``It
will be tough to make No. 1 by the time I'm 30, but I'll take it some
time in my 30s.''
This fall Springer took five weeks off from the PGA Tour, but not from
golf. He made time to sneak up to the Olympic Club from his home in
Fresno for four exploratory rounds of golf at the site of this week's
season-ending tournament.
``So when I came here this week, I'd know where I wanted to hit my
shots,'' he said. The reconnaissance mission apparently worked --
Springer was low man, with a 4-under-par 67, in yesterday's pro-am, in
which 120 amateurs paid $10,000 apiece to tee it up with the top 30
money winners on the 1994 PGA Tour.
Just like that, Springer sneaked up on the tour this year. In his
fourth season, he became one of only three pros with more than one tour
win; Nick Price has five, plus the British Open; Springer and Mark
McCumber have two each.
For someone who left San Francisco when he was 2, Springer's memory of
the city is pretty good.
``Uh, is there a St Mary's?'' he ventured when asked the hospital where
he was born (on Nov. 3, 1965).
``My dad was going to San Francisco State. We lived in the student
housing,'' he said. ``My dad got a teaching degree in physical
education.''
His dad, Paul, eventually moved his family to the valley, first to
Visalia and then to Dinuba (Fresno County), where he currently is the
athletic director at Dinuba High School. Mike Springer grew up playing
basketball and golf and eventually competed in the latter at the
University of Arizona, winning second-team All-America honors.
In June of 1986 Springer returned to California to win the State
Amateur at Pebble Beach, defeating Bobby May, 4-and-3, in the final.
Two years later Springer turned pro, went out and won Hogan Tour events
in Bakersfield and Fresno and reached the PGA Tour in 1991.
His fellow competitors have taken notice. ``He's got a great build for
golf, strong legs,'' Ben Crenshaw said during a Monday clinic. ``He's a
good iron player. And this boy's a great putter. He's got good hands
and good imagination.''
Springer's '94 season has not been without adversity, though. ``I had a
good first five months in 1994, but I busted my big toe after the
Greesnoboro win.''
Your big toe?
``On a bed post in Houston,'' he said. He had this room, see, and it
had a platform bed, see, and the post was kind of hidden, see. ``I
couldn't play for three weeks, and I lost the feel I had at
Greensboro,'' he said. ``I didn't miss 10 shots that whole week.''
He rebounded to win at Milwaukee with some clutch putting, and his
strong '94 showing has resulted in offers for overseas appearances in
November and December, which is why he took the five-week vacation in
September and early October, going hunting and fishing with friends and
scouting Olympic.
``Plus I was getting kind of burned out from the hotels, the grind, the
food, just all the s-- you put up with,'' he said.
Exhibit A: This year's British Open at Turnberry, Scotland. ``I got
stuck there,'' he said. ``Price and (Greg) Norman were out of there
right away in their planes. I had to wait 16 hours.''
Fresno has become relatively easy to reach by air because American
flies there from Dallas-Fort Worth, Springer explained, ``but having a
private plane would be the ideal situation.''
Spoken like a golfer who can't wait to be No. 1. The first No. 1 from
Fresno, too.
