UN Chief Suggests Continued Mideast Observers' Presence 
United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has recommended
that the Security Council extend the mandate of the 1,041-strong U.N.
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for six months until November 30.
UNDOF was established in may 1974 to supervise the cease-fire called
for by the Security Council and the agreement on disengagement between
Israeli and Syrian forces of May 1974
In his report on UNDOF, which was available on Monday, the
Secretary-General said that during the past six months, the situation
in the Israel-Syria sector has remained quiet and there has been no
serious incident.
However, he warned that despite the present quiet in the area, the
situation in the Middle East "continues to be potentially dangerous and
is likely to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement
covering all aspects of the Middle East problem can be reached."
