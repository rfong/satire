Canberra warns Hong Kong in battle over Qantas rights 
The Australian government has reportedly warned Hong Kong against
imposing sanctions on Qantas, saying it would consider "whatever means
are available" to protect the national flag carrier.
A warning by Transport Minister Laurie Brereton followed the collapse
of bilateral talks in Canberra this week to settle a dispute over
claims by Hong Kong that Qantas has infringed its intra-Asia traffic
rights by using Hong Kong as a hub from which to carry excessive
passenger levels.
In a dispute reminiscent of Qantas's 1993 battle with the US carrier
Northwest Airlines over traffic from Japan, Hong Kong carrier Cathay
Pacific has accused Qantas of carrying up to 85 percent passenger loads
out of Hong Kong.
Hong Kong aviation authorities are expected to impose from the
beginning of May a 35-percent limit on the number of passengers carried
by Qantas from Hong Kong to Bangkok and Singapore.
Hong Kong authorities are reported to have rejected a compromise offer
by Canberra that it would agree to a 35-percent limitation if Hong Kong
granted rights for an Australian airline to fly to London, Taiwan or
Tokyo through Hong Kong.
However, Brereton was reported here Saturday to have said Canberra was
"four-square behind Qantas" in the dispute, and awaiting a first move
by Hong Kong authorities.
"It's a question of the Hong Kong authorities pursuing with a very
tough line the financial interests of their carrier, Cathay Pacific,
just as we in Australian stand four-square behind our flag carrier," he
told The Australian.
He said it was too early to talk about tit-for-tat sanctions.
The dispute comes at a difficult time for the Australian government in
the run up to its privatisation of predominantly state-owned Qantas.
Any threat to its lucrative Asian routes could threaten the two-billion
Australian dollar (1.5 billion US) valuation it places on Qantas for
the share-float now timed for the middle of 1995.
