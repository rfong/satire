Canada, Chile sign free trade deal
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Chilean President Eduardo Frei
signed a free trade agreement Monday between their two countries.
The deal is designed to pave the way for Chile's eventual accession to
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which currently
comprises Canada, Mexico and the United States.
At a press conference, Chretien said he understood that US President
Bill Clinton would resume his efforts soon to obtain fast-track
negotiating authority from Congress to enable the NAFTA-Chile talks to
begin.
Meanwhile, Frei said that thanks to the agreement liberalising
investment rules, Canadian businesses that invest in Chile would have
access to the wider Mercosur customs union, a South American
mega-market of nearly 250 million consumers.
Mercosur groups Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Chile and
Bolivia are signing on as associate members.
Hopes for an agreement to expand NAFTA to embrace Chile by the end of
1995 fell through after Clinton failed to persuade the
Republican-dominated Congress to agree to the fast track procedure.
The Canada-Chile pact has two side agreements -- on labour laws and
environmental protection -- similar to the side agreements signed as a
condition of Mexico's accession to NAFTA.
Chretien warned that if the United States and Mexico did not hurry up
with an agreement to expand NAFTA to include Chile, the goal of
negotiating a pan-American Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by
2005 -- promised at a hemispheric summit in Miami in 1994 -- would not
be attainable.
On Friday in Chicago, a senior US trade official said the United States
remained committed to a two-track approach to achieving economic
integration of the Americas.
Peter Allgeier, an associate US Trade Representative, said the parallel
paths were expanding NAFTA and pursuing pan-American talks on trade
liberalization and harmonization of regulatory policy.
Allgeier said that though hemispheric economic integration may not be a
priority for the new Congress, "with the US elections out of the way,
more and more people realize we (the administration) need to have that
authority" in talks not only in the hemisphere, but also with Asian
countries, the European Union and at the World Trade Organization.
