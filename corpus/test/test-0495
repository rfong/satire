Bahrain to name its first ambassador to Baghdad since Gulf War 
Bahrain has decided to upgrade its diplomatic representation in Baghdad
to ambassador level for the first time since the 1991 Gulf War,
Information Minister Nabil al-Hamr said Wednesday.
"This is a normal move" in the context of the rapprochement between
Iraq and both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, initiated at last week's Arab
summit in Beirut, Hamr told AFP.
Moreover, "thousands of Bahrainis visit holy sites in Iraq and
bilateral trade is increasing, making it necessary to have an
ambassador at the head of the (Bahraini) mission" in Baghdad, he said.
He did not disclose the name of the new envoy.
Many Bahrainis visit Shiite Muslim holy sites in Najaf, Karbala and
Samarra in southern Iraq and Kazimieh in Baghdad.
Bahrain and Iraq did not sever diplomatic ties despite Baghdad's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, but their embassies in each other's capital were
headed by charges d'affaires.
Iraq last October upgraded its representation in Manama, appointing Ali
Sebti al-Hadithi as its first ambassador to Bahrain since the Gulf War,
in which a US-led coalition evicted Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
