Chang slows big-serving foe 
Michael Chang shrugged off the record-smashing serves of Canada's Greg
Rusedski for a 7-6 (8/6), 7-6 (10/8) victory Friday and a semi-final
berth at the 328,000-dollar ATP San Jose Open.
Rusedski's serve was timed at 137 mph (218 k/hr) -- the fastest
recorded since clocking began six years ago according to ATP officials
here.
"I don't know too many things that go faster than that -- maybe the
Concorde," Chang said.
The 21-year-old Canadian left-hander had triple set point on Chang in
the second set before he rallied to hold serve and eventually force a
tiebreaker.
"That was a crucial point for me," admitted Chang, who has won five of
six meetings with Rusedski, losing only in 1993 in Tokyo.
"He took advantage of all the key points," Rusedski said. "Give him a
little crack in a tight situation and he is going to beat you."
MaliVai Washington, seeded fifth, also advanced, beating fellow US
player Bryan Shelton 6-2, 6-1.
