Bush wins 61st Annual Stalin Literary Award
In a non-televised awards ceremony during his recent trip to Mongolia,
U.S. President G.W. Bush was awarded the prestigious Stalin Literacy
Award by local citizens. Chosen from more than 1,000 submitted
applicants, the American President was picked as "Most likely to write
his own version of history", by an esteemed association of
international lawyers, insurance salesmen, drummers and towing company
owners., otherwise known as the Stalin Literary Group.
The organization formed during WWII when a group of Army projector
operators decided to record their own documentaries about the war.
Since they were all stationed in Alabama, they could only report events
to fit the local footage they had available.
The best remembered Stalin group footage from the era, is the dramatic
picture of the American flag being raised over the Piggly-Wiggly in
Bovina. Taken just after American troops defeated the German farmers
near the John Deere factory on Highway 2. It is still regarded as
undisputable evidence America defeated Germany in WWII by many citizens
of Alabama today.
The Stalinists have grown to international levels legitimacy through
their work with the WTO, the Republican Party and the Al-Qaeda. This
year marks theier 61st year, and the 61st year the sacred "Quill
through the Skull" statue has been presented. Former U.S. President
Dick Nixon, and personal friend of God, Pat Robertson, are the only
other Americans to win the lofty award.
The first non-North Korean to win the prize in the last three years, it
was President Bush's on-going fabrications about motivations for
entering the Iraq War that especially endeared him to the judges,
sources close to the judges revealed. His systematic abuse of the
Christian religion also apparently drew high marks.
Distant second place runner-up, Vlad Bolshitska, a one-time Stalin
Literary Lifetime Achievement winner ,for his career work with the
Pravda, was clearly emotional, though humble in his defeat. "How is
White-Out supposed to compete with PhotoSuite and CIA," Vlad reportedly
exclaimed to one Mongol news reporter.
To end the event, President Bush graciously thanked the crowd, the
judges and his speech writers. He also half-jokingly vowed to
re-emphasize America's great victory over Vietnam this upcoming year,
in hopes of getting a foot in for next year's extravaganza. The
ceremony closed with the traditional kniving of the sacrificial Press
Goat, and the circular dance of Pass the Tugrik Unc.
