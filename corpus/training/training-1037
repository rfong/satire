French budget minister says extra cuts needed to meet deficit target 
French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said Tuesday that more cuts were
to be made in state spending to ensure that the target for the budget
deficit this year was met.
The cuts would affect everyone, he warned.
"I am preparing to take extremely firm measures in the next few days to
deal with the budget for 1995," he said in remarks on French radio.
"It is my duty to respect the deficit which was set by parliament in
July. We must not exceed 321 billion francs.
"There will be new cuts and everyone, believe me, will have to
contribute."
His remarks were seen as highlighting problems facing the centre-right
government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe in containing the deficit this
year as part of an ambitious plan to reduce the deficit to three
percent of gross domestic product in 1997 in time for France to be a
founder of a single European currency.
Deep doubts among international financiers that the government can
introduce tough measures to achieve this, and will stand up to social
unrest in protest at such austerity, have undermined credibility in the
franc.
The member of parliament responsible for summarising work on the budget
for next year by the parliamentary finance commission said on Monday
that the budget for 1996 was rather "anaemic".
He said that there were "still some savings to be made".
During debate in the commission supporters of the government revolted
three times last week to cut the deficit by more than the government
had intended.
The government has warned that tax revenue, particularly from
companies, will fall far short of expectations this year.
On Monday the association of French financial analysts slashed
predictions for profits by top French companies.
