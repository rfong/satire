Jordan's King Abdullah calls for timetable to set up Palestinian state 
Jordan's King Abdullah II warned that Washington must draw up a
reasonable timetable for the establishment of a Palestinian state in
order to quell violence in the Middle East, in remarks published
Saturday.
He also reiterated his opposition to any future military strikes on
Iraq, in an interview with Kuwait's English-language Arab Times
newspaper.
Abdullah welcomed US President George W. Bush's call for a Palestinian
state, and said he believed it should be set up "according to the
pre-1967 borders".
That was a reference to the 1967 Middle East war in which Israel
captured east Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, West Bank, all territories the
Palestinians want as part of an eventual state.
He stressed that support for "a Palestinian state must be accompanied
by talk of a timetable," and warned that if the state "is not
established on Palestinian land within a reasonable period of time and
with the agreement of the concerned parties, violence will continue."
He also said he hoped Syria and Lebanon would be brought into the peace
process to bring a "comprehensive" peace to the region. Israel also
captured territory from Syria in 1967, which it is still holding.
The king also said the future of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was
only for the Palestinian people to decide. "It is a very serious matter
to let others think for peoples," he said.
As for Iraq, the king warned that any military action against Baghdad
would be "a catastrophe not just for Iraq but for the entire region."
"We are still requesting a solution to the dispute between Iraq, the
United States and the United Nations. A solution that could start
practical, serious discussion that could save the region from more
disasters from which we are still suffering," he said.
