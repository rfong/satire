Clinton/NNP on/IN the/DT attack/NN after/IN poll/NN boost/NN by/IN Christian/NNP Chaise/NNP President/NNP Bill/NNP Clinton/NNP 's/POS new/JJ toughness/NN with/IN the/DT Republicans/NNPS seems/VBZ an/DT outgrowth/NN of/IN his/PRP$ rebounding/VBG popularity/NN in/IN the/DT last/JJ month/NN ,/, even/RB as/IN many/DT viewed/VBD him/PRP as/IN a/DT spent/VBN force/NN ./.

Clinton/NNP stood/VBD firm/NN Friday/NNP against/IN Republican/JJ congressional/JJ leaders/NNS over/IN federal/JJ budget/NN legislation/NN ,/, which/WDT could/MD prompt/VB him/PRP to/TO use/VB his/PRP$ veto/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ./.

Passed/VBN Thursday/NNP by/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Representatives/NNPS ,/, the/DT legislation/NN aims/VBZ to/TO cut/VB federal/JJ spending/NN by/IN 16.4/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS during/IN the/DT current/JJ year/NN ./.

Clinton/NNP reiterated/VBD Friday/NNP that/IN while/IN he/PRP shared/VBD Republican/JJ zeal/NN for/IN reducing/VBG the/DT federal/JJ budget/NN deficit/NN ,/, he/PRP rejected/VBD cuts/NNS targeting/VBG education/NN and/CC the/DT environment/NN ./.

Clinton/NNP brandished/VBD the/DT threat/NN of/IN a/DT veto/NN again/RB Friday/NNP ,/, warning/VBG Republicans/NNS he/PRP would/MD oppose/VB efforts/NNS to/TO rescind/VB key/JJ provisions/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ anti-crime/JJ bill/NN --/: which/WDT impose/VB a/DT five-day/JJ waiting/VBG period/NN on/IN gun/NN purchases/NNS and/CC ban/VB possession/NN and/CC sale/NN of/IN 19/CD types/NNS of/IN semi-automatic/JJ weapons/NNS ./.

Clinton/NNP 's/POS new/JJ combativeness/NNS contrasts/VBZ with/IN the/DT conciliatory/JJ stance/NN he/PRP adopted/VBD toward/IN the/DT new/JJ Republican/JJ congress/NN soon/RB after/IN the/DT GOP/NNP sweep/NN in/IN the/DT mid-term/JJ November/NNP 1994/CD elections/NNS ./.

While/IN his/PRP$ approval/NN ratings/NNS hovered/VBD at/IN an/DT all-time/JJ low/NN ,/, the/DT president/NN stressed/VBD what/WP he/PRP and/CC the/DT Republicans/NNPS shared/VBD ,/, emphasizing/VBG his/PRP$ support/NN for/IN some/DT of/IN their/PRP$ proposals/NNS --/: notably/RB tax/NN cuts/NNS ./.

But/CC Clinton/NNP changed/VBD his/PRP$ tactics/NNS in/IN early/RB April/NNP ,/, stressing/VBG since/IN then/RB the/DT differences/NNS between/IN himself/PRP and/CC the/DT Republicans/NNPS ./.

Opinion/NNP polls/NNS ,/, meanwhile/RB ,/, show/VBP support/NN for/IN the/DT GOP/NNP diminishing/VBG as/IN Americans/NNPS grasp/VBP the/DT extent/NN and/CC impact/NN of/IN their/PRP$ proposed/VBN budget/NN cuts/NNS on/IN popular/JJ programs/NNS ./.

The/DT Republicans/NNPS won/VBD majorities/NNS in/IN both/DT houses/NNS of/IN Congress/NNP on/IN a/DT platform/NN that/WDT emphasized/VBD reducing/VBG the/DT scope/NN and/CC spending/NN of/IN federal/JJ programs/NNS ,/, built/VBN by/IN Democrats/NNS over/IN 60/CD years/NNS ./.

Legislation/NN passed/VBN Thursday/NNP includes/VBZ a/DT draconian/JJ plan/NN that/WDT would/MD balance/VB the/DT budget/NN over/IN seven/CD years/NNS by/IN slashing/VBG social/JJ programs/NNS ,/, some/DT of/IN them/PRP viewed/VBN as/IN sacrosanct/NN ./.

Those/DT include/VBP Medicare/NNP ,/, which/WDT subsidizes/VBZ medical/JJ care/NN for/IN 37/CD million/CD retired/JJ Americans/NNPS ./.

A/DT poll/NN published/VBN Tuesday/NNP showed/VBD 60/CD percent/NN of/IN Americans/NNS opposed/VBN to/TO the/DT House/NNP plan/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, Clinton/NNP 's/POS own/JJ popularity/NN rating/NN rocketed/VBD upwards/NNS ,/, notably/RB in/IN the/DT wake/NN of/IN the/DT Oklahoma/NNP City/NNP bombing/NN that/WDT killed/VBD 167/JJ people/NNS a/DT month/NN ago/RB ./.

Public/NNP opinion/NN surveys/NNS suggest/VBP that/IN Clinton/NNP performed/VBD almost/RB flawlessly/JJ in/IN the/DT wake/NN of/IN the/DT tragedy/NN ,/, which/WDT seems/VBZ to/TO have/VB given/VBN him/PRP a/DT more/RBR ``/`` presidential/JJ ''/'' image/NN ./.

The/DT most/RBS recent/JJ poll/NN showed/VBD the/DT president/NN 's/POS approval/NN rating/NN at/IN around/RB 56/CD percent/NN --/: 10/CD points/NNS higher/JJR than/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT month/NN ago/RB and/CC its/PRP$ highest/JJS level/NN in/IN a/DT year/NN ./.

Clinton/NNP ,/, moreover/RB ,/, has/VBZ also/RB taken/VBN popular/JJ positions/NNS that/IN the/DT Republicans/NNPS can/MD not/RB oppose/VB ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT imposition/NN of/IN trade/NN sanctions/NNS against/IN Japan/NNP ./.

Meeting/VBG Friday/NNP with/IN more/JJR than/IN a/DT dozen/NN police/NN union/NN officials/NNS ,/, Clinton/NNP attacked/VBD Republicans/NNS in/IN the/DT name/NN of/IN defending/VBG law-enforcement/JJ officials/NNS ,/, a/DT favorite/JJ Republican/JJ theme/NN ./.

A/DT powerful/JJ right-wing/JJ pressure/NN group/NN opposed/VBD to/TO any/DT limits/NNS on/IN gun/NN sales/NNS and/CC ownership/NN ,/, the/DT National/NNP Rifle/NNP Association/NNP ,/, recently/RB attacked/VBD law-enforcement/JJ agents/NNS ,/, calling/VBG them/PRP ``/`` Nazis/JJ ''/'' and/CC ``/`` jack-booted/JJ thugs/NNS ./.

Whether/IN Clinton/NNP 's/POS recent/JJ rebound/NN will/MD last/VB remains/VBZ to/TO be/VB seen/VBN ,/, as/IN Whitewater/NNP investigations/NNS --/: touching/VBG on/IN the/DT financial/JJ dealings/NNS of/IN Clinton/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ wife/NN while/IN he/PRP was/VBD governor/NN of/IN Arkansas/NNP --/: continue/VBP with/IN questioning/VBG of/IN one/CD of/IN Clinton/NNP 's/POS closest/JJS advisers/NNS ,/, Bruce/NNP Lindsey/NNP ./.
