China's Offshore Oil Tops 10 Million Tons 
The China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) announced here today that
its offshore crude output has topped 10 million tons since the
beginning of this year, a record high.
A senior CNOOC official puts the annual estimate at 14 million tons, or
an increase of 6 million tons over the 1995 figure.
According to CNOOC President Wang Yan, this represents a major
breakthrough in 14 years of China's offshore oil undertaking.
The senior official noted that in addition to crude output, China will
still pump 3 billion cu m of offshore natural gas this year, which will
be equivalent to 17 million tons of crude oil.
Wang stressed that this should be also attributable to Sino-overseas
cooperation in this regard.
To date, CNOOC has signed 119 oil and gas contracts with more than 60
overseas oil companies worldwide, absorbing a total overseas investment
of 5.24 billion US dollars.
The CNOOC source added that through more than a dozen years of its own
efforts and Sino-overseas cooperation, China has so far discovered over
90 oil and gas bearing structures and verified oil and gas geological
reserves of 1.3 billion tons and 300 billion cu m respectively.
Of the 19 oil and gas fields operational offshore, the Yacheng 13-1 gas
field and Liuhua 11-1 oil field in the South China Sea are the largest,
which produce annually 3.4 billion cu m of gas and 2.5 million tons of
crude, respectively. The latter has a geological crude reserve of about
200 million tons.
