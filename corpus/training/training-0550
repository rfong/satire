Kenya's Economic Growth Slows Down 
Kenya's economic growth rate in 1966 dropped to 4.6 percent from 4.8
percent in 1995 and is expected to be at 5.2 percent this year.
The 1997 Economic Survey released here on Tuesday said that the failing
to meet the 5.5 percent growth target last year was partly attributed
to the recent drought between October and March hit in most parts of
the country.
Launching the document, Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti noted that
despite inadequate rains and reduced use of farm inputs, the
agricultural sector recorded a growth of 4.4 percent in 1996.
Saitoti who is also minister for planning and national development
noted that the agricultural sector would continue to provide the
stimulus for growth.
The average long rains received in the months of April and May this
year are expected to boost agricultural production.
The growth in manufacturing sector was 3.7 percent, a drop from the
previous year's 3.9 percent, according to the survey.
The financial sector, it pointed out, recorded a 7.1 percent growth
rate with its share of the GDP rising to 10 percent from 9.8 percent
the previous year.
During the year under review, the tourism sector, the second highest
foreign exchange earner after agriculture, fetched 474 million U.S.
Dollars while the number of visitors to the country went up by 1.9
percent from 690,000 in 1995 to 717,000 last year.
On international trade, the over-all balance of payments account
registered a high surplus of 430 million Dollars, compared with a
deficit of 136 million Dollars in 1995.
Saitoti said that the projected recovery of the industrial sectors, the
government's continued implementation of macro-economic reforms and
structural adjustments were expected to further trigger growth in
Kenya's economy.
He noted that the government would continue to strive to control its
expenditure and improve on revenue collection, and would intervene to
gradually bring down the prevailing high interest rates.
