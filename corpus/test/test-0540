IFC Increases Investments in Africa 
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) Monday announced its plan
to invest 14.4 million U.S. dollars in Settavex, the largest integrated
textile company in Morocco, to help it produce higher value-added
products.
IFC will provide a 5.4 million dollar loan and an equity investment of
up to 9 million dollars. Settavex is responding to strong competition
in the industry by undertaking a 46 million dollars upgrading and
expansion project to shift part of its output from commodity-like basic
articles to higher-margin, more refined differentiated articles such as
gabardines, khakis, chinos and corduroys.
Later last week, IFC signed agreements to invest 120 million dollars
towards construction of the Mozal Aluminum smelter of Mozambique, and
international lenders would likely provide financing totaling 820
million dollars.
The project is the largest single private sector investment to date in
the country.
The Mozal project will contribute to successful economic reform
initiatives in Mozambique, with annual production capacity of 250,000
tons of primary aluminum ingots that will triple the country's exports
and add more than 7 percent of GDP from the first year of operation.
Mozal's total project cost of 1.34 billion dollars will be financed
through equity of 520 million dollars, subordinated loans of 150
million dollars, and senior loans of 670 million dollars. IFC will
provide 65 million dollars in a subordinated loan.
IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and also the largest
multilateral source of lending in private sectors of developing
countries.
