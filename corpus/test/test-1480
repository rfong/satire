Foreign Advisers to Meet for Development of Guangdong 
Guangdong Province in south China is to hold its second consultative
conference on economic development at which foreign advisers to the
provincial governor will offer their advice.
Altogether 25 foreign advisers, including John Browne from BP Amoco,
Peter Knook from Microsoft, Mark Moody Stuart from the Royal
Dutch-Shell Group and Dr. Colin Lucas from University of Oxford, are
scheduled to attend the meeting slated for November 15- 16 in
Guangzhou, the provincial capital.
Patrzio Bianchi, a professor from an Italy's think tank on industrial
development policies, the first foreign adviser who arrived here Monday
afternoon, is expected to discuss the possibility of setting up a
branch of the think tank in China.
From 1999, Guangdong Governor Lu Ruihua began to invite economists and
senior officials of multinational companies to offer advice on the
province's economic development.
Guangdong is one of the fastest development regions in China.
