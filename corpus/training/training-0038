Falun Gong: Anti-Humanity, Denounces People's Daily 
The People's Daily, China's leading Chinese newspaper, will publish a
commentary Friday condemning the notorious Falun Gong cult, headed by
Li Hongzhi, for its anti-humane nature.
The newspaper said recently that an ailing Liu Renfang, a Falun Gong
follower peasant in southwest China's Sichuan Province, refused to go
to hospital and take any medicine at home. Instead, she came to Beijing
to "protect" Falun Gong doctrine, where she finally died of her
illness.
However, according to the commentary, her practitioner peers discarded
her body in a river in Beijing's Tongzhou District in order to pass the
responsibility and to keep the death secret from the public.
The commentary pointed out that this action is an irrefutable evidence
showing how Li Hongzhi and his organization in the United States
control his followers in China. They and their followers in Beijing
have discussed and arranged how to deal with the body and avoid being
held responsible.
The newspaper analyzed that because of the evil nature of Li and his
organization they are sure to slaughter life and endanger the country.
They dare not expose the fact to the public and the followers. "They
are true liars," stressed the paper.
The commentary concluded that to value life, people should keep on
battling the evil cult.
