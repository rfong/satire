Laos's industry grows by nine percent 
Industry in Laos grew by nine percent in 1993-1994, generating an
income of 1.77 billion dollars for the country and accounting for 18
percent of its gross domestic product, a report said Thursday.
And the government plans to pump 37.3 million dollars -- or 14.2
percent of the total investment in Laos -- into the sector in 1994-1995
in a bid to boost the country's industrialisation programme, the KPL
news agency reported.
The investment will target the areas of energy and power generation,
the offcial agency said in a dispatch monitored here.
Quoting the country's industry ministry, the agency said the Laos would
also expand electrification in rural areas, build 15 electricity
generator points and also enlarge the transportation network, it said
without elaborating.
