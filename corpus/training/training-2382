Profile of Top Male Winners of NYC Marathon 
John sagwe of Kenya won men's championship in the 28th New York City
Marathon here today, closing at 2:08:12.
He bettered his previous record of 2:09:07 in the Prague Marathon in
May and last year's NYC Marathon best at 2:09:54 set by Italian Giacomo
Leone.
Kagwe, born on September 1, 1969, finished fifth NYC Marathon in
2:11:42 and fourth last year in 2:10:59.
He was second in the Philadelphia Half Marathon in September, clocking
a career-best 1:01:18.
He also won the Old Kent River Bank 25k this year and was the 1995
Pittsburgh Marathon winner in a course-record 2:10:24.
Kagwe's compatriot Joseph Chebet finished second at today's NYC
Marathon in 2:09:27 against his career best at 2:08:23 in Turin in May.
Born on August 23, 1970, Chebet began his Marathon career only last
year with a 2:10:57 win in the 1996 Amsterdam Marathon, over a course
not noted for producing fast times.
In September he won a half-marathon in Luxembourg in 1:00:53, posting
another career best.
Italian Stafano Baldini, born on May 25, 1971, won the third place in
the 28th NYC Marathon with 2:09:31. He is a national record holder with
a 2:07:57 clocked at the 1997 London Marathon, a gap of only two
seconds to the champion Antonio Pinto of Portugal.
Prior to that, his best was 2:11:01 from a sixth-place finish in his
marathon debut at the 1995 Venice Marathon.
Baldini has excelled in the half-marathon, setting the Italian record
of 1:00:56 with a win in Rome earlier this year.
