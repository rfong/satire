Arafat happy to be a father 
A smiling PLO chairman Yasser Arafat went uncharacteristically shy on
Tuesday when asked how it felt to be a father for the first time.
"I have the same the feelings as any other father," Arafat told
reporters before disappearing into his seafront headquarters in Gaza
City.
His wife Suha gave birth to a girl, Zahwa, at the American Hospital in
Paris on Monday evening.
Arafat, 65, had planned to travel to Paris on Wednesday to attend the
birth.
His adviser Nabil Abu Rudeinah said the PLO leader would keep to his
original schedule following Monday's suicide bombing which killed five
Israelis and wounded 33.
The Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) claimed responsibility for the
attack, which Arafat strongly condemned, in a Tel Aviv suburb.
Arafat, who married secretly five years ago, was also due to meet
France's President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Alain Juppe and
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette during a one-day trip to Paris, the
adviser said.
Jordan's King Hussein sent his congratulations.
"King Hussein called president Arafat on the telephone to congratulate
him on the birth of his daughter," Abu Rudeinah said.
"The two men agreed to meet as soon as possible."
