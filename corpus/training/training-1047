Belarussian Parliament Approves Yermoshin as Premier 
The Belarussian parliament Tuesday approved Vladimir Yermoshin as prime
minister by a vote of 103 against 95 with one abstention.
Belarus is now at a point where market mechanisms have not kicked in,
while state regulation is not working properly, Yermoshin told the
parliament before the voting, cited by the Interfax news agency.
In this context, the national economy will not stabilize any time soon
"without a rational and balanced crediting and monetary policy, without
bringing inflation down to five percent monthly or a balanced pricing
policy," he stressed.
The National Bank must purchase hard currency on the domestic market
and create sufficient gold and currency reserves by issuing preference
securities, Yermoshin told the assembly deputies. Production expenses
must be cut and the quality of products improved so as to make them
more competitive, especially on foreign markets, he said.
He said Minsk will expand the cooperation with international financial
organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund.
The new prime minister was born in 1942 in Pronsk in Russia's Ryazan
region. He graduated from Novocherkassk Polytechnic in 1964 and from
the Academy of Civil Aviation in Leningrad in 1989. He worked as an
engineer and chief technologist in Minsk since 1965, and later as
deputy director of an aircraft building plant.
Yermoshin was elected chairman of a Minsk district legislature in 1990.
He became deputy chairman of the Minsk city legislature in charge of
municipal services, energy and construction in 1991 and has chaired the
Minsk legislature since 1995. Yermoshin also serves as a member of the
upper house of the Belarussian parliament.
He was nominated prime minister by Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko on February 18.
