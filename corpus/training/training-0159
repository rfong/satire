France Says No Decision Is Made to Evacuate Expatriates 
France said today that no decision has been made so far to evacuate the
French expatriates from Kinshasa, after the forces of the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire-Congo (ADFL) entered the
city today.
``For the moment, the security of the French community, as that of
other foreign expatriates, is not threatened. No decision of evacuation
has been made for the moment,'' said a spokesman of the French Foreign
Ministry.
About 4,000 troops from the United States, France, Belgium and Britain
are waiting in Congo or on navy vessels moored near the coast of Congo
for a possible evacuation of thousands of Westerners from Kinshasa.
Reports from Kinshasa said that the soldiers of the ADFL have taken
control of the parliament building and the Voice of Zaire national
radio station.
The ADFL leader Laurent-Desire Kabila, who has declared himself head of
state, will make a radio-television speech within minutes. Endtem nnnn
