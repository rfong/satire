Muslim Parties Win Mostar Council Elections 
The list of "For a United Mostar" presented by Muslim-dominated parties
has narrowly won Mostar elections Sunday, according to preliminary
results.
The electoral commission of Mostar reported today the list of "For a
United Mostar" won 48 percent of the votes in the elections which aimed
to set up a unified town council for the ethnically-torn city under the
Dayton peace accord.
The list of Bosnia's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won 45 percent of
the votes, with the remaining votes going to small parties and
independent candidates.
In the 37-seat council, 16 each will be held by Muslims and Croats with
the remaining five by Serbs and other minorities.
The elections were formerly scheduled for May 31, but on May 24 the
Croat and Muslim sides reached an agreement to postpone the elections
until the second half of June.
The delay of the Mostar elections stemmed from Muslim's complaint that
the previous date would prevent refugees abroad from participating in
the elections.
During Sunday's elections, the list of "For a United Mostar" which
groups the candidates of the Democratic Action Party, Party for
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Liberal Bosnia Organization, enjoyed the
support in the three east Muslim-dominated municipalities and at the
polling stations abroad.
The HDZ list won most votes in the three west Croat-dominated
municipalities.
About 60 percent of the 100,000 registered voters turned out in the
elections.
Official returns are expected to be released Wednesday.
