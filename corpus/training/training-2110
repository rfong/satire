A man and a woman were killed and 42 wounded, some seriously, by an
unexplained blast during a circumcision ceremony in the Omdurman
district of the Sudanese capital.
An official of the attorney general's office told the independent

during the ceremony Friday night.
An investigation has already started, the official added.
The official said the district where the incident happened is a shanty
town without electricity.
