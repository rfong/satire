Cristal Stuns Velez with Late Goal 
Peruvian champions Sporting Cristal knocked former champions Velez
Sarsfield out of the South American Libertadores Cup thanks to a goal
in the dying minute on Thursday.
The Argentines, winners in 1994, had held Cristal to a 0-0 draw in Lima
in the first leg of the second round tie but were unable to capitalise
on their apparent advantage against a well-organised Peruvian defence.
Jorge Soto scored the only goal of the match with two minutes remaining
to give Cristal a shock 1-0 win on aggregate.
It was the first time for 30 years that a Peruvian team had won a
Libertadores match in Argentina.
Cristal joined Bolivia's Bolivar, Brazil's Gremio, Argentina's Racing
club and Uruguay's Penarol in the quarter-finals. The remaining three
ties are due to be settled next week.
