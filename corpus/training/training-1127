Pakistani women protest Taliban ban on girl schools, jobs 
Pakistani women have staged a demonstration in the northwestern city of
Peshawar to condemn Afghanistan's new Taliban regime for denying women
rights and executing a former communist president, reports said Friday.
The rally, organised by Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and
attended by non-governmental organisations Thursday, was attended by
several dozen women, escorted by men.
The marchers gathered outside the provincial assembly building,
chanting slogans against restrictions imposed on women by the Taliban
including a ban on female employment and the closing of girls' schools
in areas under their control.
Criticising what they called the attitude of the Taliban militia
towards Afghan women, they also condemned the killing of former
president Mohammed Najibullah soon after the September 27 fall of
Kabul, The Frontier Post said.
"We condemn the attitude of Taliban towards women in Afghanistan," the
paper quoted activist Rakhshanda Naz as saying. Naz also expressed the
fear that the Taliban policy could affect women in Pakistan.
A provincial deputy, Begum Nasim Wali Khan, whose progressive Awami
National Party (ANP) has ethnic affiliations with Pashtuns residing
across the border, slammed the Taliban for disgracing the bodies of
Najibullah and his brother Shahpour Ahmedzai after their execution.
She also accused Pakistan of supporting the Taliban at the instigation
of the West. The Afhgan problem could only be solved only after foreign
powers stopped meddling in Afghanistan, she said.
She said her party had also written a letter to the United Nations for
having failed to protect Najibullah from Taliban fighters.
Najibullah had been living in a UN building in Kabul since the collapse
of his government in April 1992.
The Islamic militia dragged him from the UN compound and publicly
hanged his body in a Kabul street.
