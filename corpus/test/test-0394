Israeli army arrests eight more West Bank Palestinians 
The Israeli army, reportedly acting on information extracted from a
captured HAMAS military commander, arrested eight Palestinians on
Wednesday on the West Bank, military sources said.
The eight were nabbed in pre-dawn raids in the Nablus and Tulkarem
areas of the northern West Bank, the army said.
The sweep brought to nearly 40 the number of suspected militants
arrested on the West Bank since the wounding and capture Friday near
Hebron of Hassan Salameh, a leading commander of the military wing of
the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS).
Senior security officials have been quoted in the Israeli press as
saying many of the arrests result from information obtained from
Salameh, 25, during interrogation in a Jerusalem hospital where he is
being treated for bullet wounds in the back and stomach.
The commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, General Uzi Dayan,
told reporters Tuesday that Salameh's capture "allowed us, based on
information derived from his interrogation, to reach a broader
infrastructure which was linked to Hassan Salameh."
Salameh is accused of organizing three of the four suicide bombings in
Israel in February and March that killed 58 people plus the bombers.
He was the number two on Israel's most-wanted list after Mohammad Deif,
the top commander of the HAMAS military wing who is believed to be
hiding in the Gaza Strip.
Israel has arrested several hundred suspected HAMAS members and other
activists since the suicide bombings. The autonomous Palestinian
Authority is also holding around 300 militants.
