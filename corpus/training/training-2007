Murray resumes as Sunderland chairman 
Bob Murray returned to promoted Premiership side Sunderland as chairman
on Thursday, hoping to help the club sign several big-name stars.
Murray, who was first made chairman of the club back in 1986, resigned
in 1993 after pressure from fans but has maintained his position as
major shareholder since that time.
After Sunderland won the Endsleigh League championship under manager
Peter Reid two months ago, Murray is believed to have pledged around 12
million pounds (18 million dollars) towards team building over the next
two years. "My main objective is to see Sunderland and Peter Reid
compete successfully long-term in the Premier League," Murray said. "We
must complete the new stadium by July 1997 without hurting the finance
of the playing side."
"Furthermore, I want to prepare the club for a Stock Exchange
floatation to achieve the necessary funding for future prosperity,
while widening share ownership."
The Sunderland board will later this month announce the appointment of
a financial director, a position they believe will be of critical
importance to the club's future.
