Bosnian army launches "liberation war" in central highlands
In the highlands of central Bosnia, government forces have gone on the
offensive to seize back territory from the Serbs in what Sarajevo has
proclaimed a "war of liberation".
Bosnian army commander-in-chief General Rasim Delic has made it plain
that the "size of the territory of the Croat-Moslem federation will be
determined by force of arms."
At Travnik, the guns of the 7th Corps of the "Armija" set up two months
after the ceasefire between Croats and Moslems, are now trained on
Mount Vlasic, a strategic hill held by the Serbs overlooking the town
and the surrounding countryside.
For the past 10 days, Bosnian soldiers who do not have enough heavy
weapons to launch a frontal assault have started surrounding the
mountain in a pincer movement in a bid to knock out the Serb gun
batteries, UN military observers said.
They said the Bosnian manoeuvre had enabled them to advance at several
points along several kilometers (miles) of front to the east and west
of Travnik.
"How far, it's hard to say because they refuse us access to the
captured territories," said one officer of the UN Protection Force
(UNPROFOR). "Estimates range from two to 10 kilometers (one to six
miles). But we have seen preparations for the offensive for at least a
month."
At the headquarters of the 7th Corps on the banks of the river Lasva in
Travnik, foreign observers are given no encouragement to stay around.
"The situation at the front is good..... We are going to win this war,"
a Bosnian officer grunted.
After two years of fighting, the Bosnian army is better armed and
better organised and and has decided in Travnik to give no more
information and to let no one near the battlefield.
"Public opinion is of no use to us for what we have to do," the same
officer commented.
In Sarajevo, Defence Minister Hamdija Hadzihasanovic said recently that
the "reorganisation of the army is going ahead, war academies are
functioning. There is no embargo on military know-how and the war will
not stop now."
In the streets of Travnik, men in battledress pointed to the summit of
Mount Vlasic.
They spend seven days at the front then come home for three days with
their families. The whole town is caught up in the present offensive.
"Four days ago, we captured the village of Goles south west of
Travnik," one soldier said. "The battle lasted all day, all the houses
were on fire but the Chetniks (the Serbs) did not manage to retake it.
We are making progress."
The offensive continued Sunday, UN soldiers said. The Bosnian army
"told our liaison officer in Travnik that they had captured more
ground", an UNPROFOR officer in the area told AFP.
In these mountains of medium height, the Serb forces, though well
armed, are only thinly strung out along several hundred kilometers of
front.
On the Bosnian side, the end of hostilities with the Croats has freed
more men to fight the Serbs and has opened up a precious life-line to
the Croatian coast.
Converging reports from Sarajevo and central Bosnia indicate that the
Bosnian Croat HVO forces are allowing convoys of light arms and
ammunition to get through to the Moslems on condition they be allowed
to take their cut.
In the neighbouring HVO-held town of Novi Travnik, about six kilometers
(four miles) from the Moslem town, Colonel Jelco Sablic said that
relations with the Moslems were "fairly good at officer level. As for
the soldiers, those who had lost relatives in the previous fighting
"find it hard to forgive."
"We know that almost all the Moslems who were on the front against us
are now fighting the Serbs," he said. "It is normal that they should be
stronger and achieving some successes."
Sablic said he would let arms convoys through to the Moslems "if I get
orders to do so".
