European Shares Hit Record Closing Highs 
All the three major stock markets in Europe surged strongly and ended
at fresh record closing highs, boosted by the Dow's strong overnight
advance, steady Asian markets and large sums of institutional funds
seeking higher yielding investments.
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading share closed at 5,834.9, up 49.8
points or 0.86 percent, hitting its fourth record close of the month,
lifted by a strong overnight performance by shares on Wall Street and
the market was largely unaffected by the UK budget speech from
Chancellor Gordon Brown.
The FTSE shrugged off the budget, rising just three points in the
period after Brown began his speech.
The Paris CAC-40 index closed at 3,661.63, rising 63.37 points or 1.76
percent, although below an all-time high set earlier in the session as
Wall Street's weaker opening weighed on the market, still a fresh
record for the third consecutive day.
The market was boosted by continuing earnings optimism among domestic
investors and strong buying interest from foreign investors.
In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index also ended firmer at 4,946.68, up 62.83
points or 1.29 percent, a fresh record closing high. Dealers said that
the index was supported by the overnight gains on Wall Street, a firm
bond market and positive corporate news.
