Fleming leads Kiwi fightback 
Stephen Fleming fired a career-best 151 -- the highest individual tally
by a New Zealand tourist this year -- to lead a fightback against
Glamorgan here on Thursday.
The 21-year-old left-hander hit four sixes and 21 fours in a 182-ball
stay, dominating a fourth-wicket stand of 196 in 50 overs with Mark
Greatbatch.
Greatbatch surprisingly struggled, taking more than three hours for an
innings of 34, which included two boundaries.
Fleming provided the highlights of the second day's play as New Zealand
recovered from 67 for three to declare at tea on 282 for five, still 79
behind the Glamorgan first-innings total.
There was little joy for the home bowlers and Fleming hit two sixes off
Steve Bastien and one each off Robert Croft and Adrian Dale, reaching
his century from 116 balls.
Glamorgan, who have beaten New Zealand only twice in 14 meetings,
promoted Croft to opener, but he was bowled by Heath Davis for six.
Shane Thomson spun out Stephen James for 22 and Dale for 17, the latter
falling to a smart catch by Fleming. Glamorgan closed at 78 for three,
a lead of 157.
