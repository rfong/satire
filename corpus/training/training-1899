French Prime Minister Agrees to Hold Debate on Nuclear Policy 
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said on Sunday that he supports a
"great scientific and democratic debate" on the government's nuclear
power policy, after the Greens have threatened to quit the left-wing
majority over its nuclear policy.
"As for the place of nuclear energy in the future, as for the major
question of renewing the park of nuclear centers, no decision of this
scale should be made without a great scientific and democratic debate
which will examine all the consequences,'' said Jospin during a meeting
of the Socialist Party in La Rochelle in southwest France.
The leader of the French Greens, Minister of Management of Territory
and Environment Dominique Voynet, has called for a great debate on the
country's nuclear policy, after the Socialist government has planned to
renew a nuclear park near the France- Germany border.
