Heavy Rains Leave 22 Dead in South Korea 
Torrential downpours, which began to sweep South Korea from Friday
night, have made 22 people dead and 71 missing and caused huge property
damage across the country, particularly in the southern part of the
nation.
The Natural Disaster Prevention Countermeasures Headquarters Sunday
announced that as of Sunday afternoon, 22 people have been confirmed
dead and 71 others missing in Kyongsang and Cholla provinces.
Most of the dead or missing were campers, who camped out by the rivers
and valleys of such areas as Mt. Chiri and Chinju, South Kyongsang
Province.
Meanwhile, the heavy rainfalls have displaced 55 families and damaged
properties worth some 36.2 billion won (some 29 million U.S. dollars)
resulting from inundated farmland and destroyed roads, bridges and
buildings.
As rainfalls continued, the damage is likely to become greater, said
the headquarters office.
The downpour ranged from 49.7 mm to 267 mm throughout the country.
The hardest hit was Sunchon County, South Cholla Province, which had
267mm of rainfall until 11 a.m. Sunday and 231.9mm and 221mm in Chinju
and Sanchong counties, both in South Kyongsang Province, respectively.
But weathermen forecast that 80 mm to 100 mm of more rain will fall in
the provinces.
Hundreds of other campers and mountain climbers are believed still
stranded in Mountain Chiri by downpours.
So far, the headquarters office has saved 1,345 lives by mobilizing
1,579 rescue members, and 99 equipment and vehicles. Thousands of
military forces and civilians also took part in the endeavor of rescue.
