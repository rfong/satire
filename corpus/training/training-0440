Okinawa Governor Rejects Hashimoto's Base Request 
Masahide Ota, Governor of Japan's southernmost island prefecture
Okinawa, today in a letter rejected a request by Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto that he renew a lease of land in a U.S. military base, Kyodo
News reported.
In a statement issued in Tokyo, Ota said that he could not meet the
request before a final ruling of the Supreme Court over his appeal
against a lower court decision ordering him to sign documents needed
for continued rental of land owned by Okinawa residents for use by the
U.S. military.
He also noted that the content of an interim report by a Japan-U.S.
governmental panel on how to reduce U.S. bases in Okinawa is not
satisfactory to people in Okinawa.
Ota is now in Tokyo for a Supreme Court hearing over the appeal.
The central government is pushing for procedures necessary to use land
at 12 U.S. facilities, whose leases expire in May, and for the Sobe
communications installation, whose lease has already expired.
Relations between the prefecture and the U.S. have been strained since
the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen last year.
The incident sparked angry protest against the U.S. military presence
on the island and Ota has spearheaded a drive to cut down on the
American presence.
