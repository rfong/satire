China Urges Restraint in Mideast
China has repeatedly called on both Isreal and Palestine to adopt an
attitude of restraint and avoid worsening the situation in the region
in order to bring peace talks back on track.
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told Israeli Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami this over the phone, which was held at the latter's
request.
During the conversation, Ben-Ami briefed Tang on the latest development
of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the problems ahead.
"China still believes that relevant UN resolutions and the ' land for
peace' principle constitutes the basis for removing Israeli-Palestinian
differences and accomplishing a comprehensive and just peace in the
Middle East," Tang said.
As long as the two sides pursue an agreement through sincere and
practical negotiations, and earnestly implement the agreements already
reached and enhance mutual understanding, they could definitely find
out a just and reasonable solution, Tang said.
Tang said China has closely followed Israeli-Palestinian peace process,
and it has expressed grave concern over the lasting violent clashes
between the two sides and severe casualties caused by the conflicts.
The two sides recently had a new round of talks on some substantial
issues, including the sovereignty over Jerusalem, Tang said, commenting
the efforts as "positive and conducive" to easing regional tensions.
He said the Middle East issue, which is a hot problem lingering for the
longest period in the 20th century, is very complicated. " Wisdom,
courage and creativity" are required to "seek a solution acceptable for
all at an early date," he said.
China has always supported the Middle East peace process, and has made
and will make consistent efforts and contributions to push forward the
process, Tang said.
