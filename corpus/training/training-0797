Philippine Islamic fundamentalist leader surrenders 
Senior military officials on Friday said a leader of the Islamic
fundamentalist group Abu Sayyaf had surrendered in a development they
said indicated demoralization in the extemists' ranks.
Armed forces chief General Arturo Enrile and southern military
commander Lieutenant General Orlando Soriano presented the Abu Sayyaf
leader Julhani Jillang, to reporters here.
Wiry, diminutive Jillang, 30, who surrendered last week, was not
allowed to talk to journalists at southern military headquarters.
Military officials have implicated him in the kidnappings of six people
-- including Spanish priest Bernardo Blanco -- and the killing of an
army intelligence agent last year in southern Basilan province.
Blanco, 65, of Zamora, Spain, escaped from his captors on May 5, 1993
after 48 days in captivity.
Soriano said Jillang's surrender indicated that the Abu Sayyaf was in
disarray after the killing of one of its leaders in a military
operation last week that led to Monday's release without ransom of
Father Cirilo Nacorda, a priest held hostage by the group.
He added that other Abu Sayyaf members had also sent word that they
wished to surrender.
The Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for a series of kidnappings involving
foreign missionaries and bloody bomb attacks on churches in the south
since last year.
Nacorda, who was abducted on June 8 along with a group of Christians,
was held for over 60 days. He said he was freed after the leader of the
group holding him, Barahama Sali, was killed in a gunbattle with
security forces.
Sali's group on June 8 massacred 15 Christians abducted along with
Nacorda and freed 20 others later after ransom was paid.
Abu Sayyaf members, numbering about 30 armed men in Basilan, have been
on the run since a massive military operation was launched to rescue
the priest. Another 50 gunmen are belived to be at large on Jolo island
near Basilan.
