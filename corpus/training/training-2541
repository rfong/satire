Health minister raps army officers for seducing young girls 
Zimbabwe's Health Minister Timothy Stamps on Monday accused national
army officers of spreading the AIDS virus to young girls they seduced
in the hope of avoiding infection themselves.
"Some armed forces officers think that young girls are not infected
with HIV and because of that, they do not use any condoms and the girls
run the risk of being infected with AIDS," he told officers on a course
at the army Staff College in Harare.
Stamps said his ministry was receiving reports of large numbers of
girls aged between 15 and 19 who were infected with the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus that can lead to the Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS).
"This tendency of picking up young girls is not only confined to the
members of the armed forces but men in general," the minister said.
"Men are exploiting the poverty of rural girls and destroying their
lives."
Stamps said Zimbabwe had one of the highest rates of AIDS in the world
and 25 percent of all deaths of children below five were AIDS-related.
