India's hardline Hindu home minister appointed deputy premier
Indian Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani, seen as a hardline Hindu
nationalist, was promoted deputy prime minister Saturday in a shake-up of
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's coalition government, officials said.
The presidential palace announcement said Advani, who is the most
powerful man after Vajpayee in the ruling Hindu nationalist BJP party,
will continue as home minister.
Media reports Saturday said Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh was set to
swap portfolios with Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha in the cabinet
shake-up.
Speaking after the widely-expected promotion, Advani said he was
"extremely grateful" to Vajpayee.
The 74-year-old Advani, who studied law in the Pakistani city of
Karachi before the subcontinent's partition in 1947, is the seventh
leader in the history of independent India to become deputy premier.
He first held public office in 1967, becoming India's first Hindu
nationalist broadcasting minister a decade later and general secretary
of the BJP in 1980.
Advani, who is now seen as a successor to Vajpayee, favors a hardline
Indian policy for rival Pakistan.
The home minister, who also views Muslim militancy in Indian Kashmir as
cross-border terrorism from Pakistan, has steadfastly refused to snap
his political ties with hardline Hindu groups.
He fired the imagination of India's Hindu masses in 1992 by launching a
controversial drive to build a temple on the site of a Moghul-built
mosque, which led to the razing of the 16th-century shrine by Hindu
zealots in 1996 in the pilgrimage town of Ayodhya.
The sacrilege sparked nationwide Hindu-muslim riots which left more
than 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, dead.
But Analysts said his promotion was a more a political signal than an
administrative move.
"Although the post of deputy prime minister is not constitutional,
Advani's promotion clearly states that Vajpayee has found someone to
succeed him in the BJP party as well as in the government if need be,"
political analyst Anand Ojha said.
Advani became president of the BJP in 1993, appointed home minister
five years later when Vajpayee formed a shaky coalition government.
Coalition sources said Advani's promotion was among a number of changes
to be announced shortly by Vajpayee aimed at putting the finishing
touches to a long-awaited cabinet reshuffle.
BJP president Jana Krishnamurthy who resigned as BJP president earlier
Saturday said he has agreed to accept a cabinet post.
His previous role is likely to be filled by Venkaiah Naidu, the
minister for rural development, the sources said.
The cabinet reshuffle had recently become a pressing concern for
Vajpayee following the resignation of one minister and the appointment
of another as parliament speaker.
Coal and mines minister Ram Vilas Paswan quit the cabinet in May in
protest against sectarian violence in western Gujarat state in which
more than 1,000 people were killed.
Industry minister Manohar Joshi walked out a week later following his
nomination to the speaker's post.
The sources said that Vajpayee was also likely to bring in new faces
from inside the BJP party as well as from its NDA allies in the
cabinet.
Vajpayee last carried out a major reshuffle in September in a move
which was meant to speed up economic reforms.
Several new faces were brought in and privatisation minister Arun
Shourie, who has been pushing India's disinvestment program, was
elevated to cabinet rank.
