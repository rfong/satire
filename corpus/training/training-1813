Pentagon researching bomb-sniffing bees 
The Pentagon has commissioned scientists around the country to train
bees to sniff out traces of explosives in the hope one day they will be
able to track bomb ingredients to a source, The New York Times said
Monday.
The research, begun three years ago, is still in its initial stage, but
has progressed from using bees to clear minefields to training bees to
pick out a truck tainted with explosives.
The bees' bomb sniffing ability, reported the Air Force Research
Laboratory in Texas, is accurate more than 99 percent of the time,
according recent tests.
The next step for the Air Force team is to equip bees with rice
grain-size transmitters that would allow them to be tracked as they
follow trails of bomb ingredients to a source, the daily said.
University of Montana researchers said they use sugar as a reward to
train the bees to abandon flower scents for dynamite or other
explosives.
Pentagon officials admit that bomb-sniffing bees may draw a smile from
the public, but say they hold great potential.
They said trained bees in future could be placed in hives near
important security checkpoints to screen for potential terrorists.
More in the future, is the possibility that bees' ultra sensitive hairs
could be used to screen the air for biological and chemical weapons.
Researchers said early tests show that bees are efficient sampling
mechanisms for airborne bacterial spores.
Since 1998, the Pentagon has spent 25 million dollars on researching
bees and other so-called controlled biological systems -- animal traits
that could be turned into war-fighting technologies, the daily said.
