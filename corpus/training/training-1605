Bhopal residents still suffer respiratory distress 
People living near the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, when a gas
leak killed thousands in 1984 are still suffering respiratory distress,
according to research published here Friday.
The British and American researchers, whose work was published by the
British Medical Journal, questioned 454 adults who lived within radii
of two, four, six and eight kilometers (one to five miles) of the plant
that spewed tonnes of methyl-isocyanate gas.
All of the 454 were asked detailed questions about their symptoms, and
74 of underwent extensive medical testing, they said.
The results showed that the closer they lived to the plant at the time
of the leak, the more their breathing suffered today.
"Adults living within two kilometers of the factory all showed
symptoms," said the article. "Much of the disease was probably due to
irreversible obstruction in small airways in the lungs."
The Bhopal gas leak killed 1,750 outright, and a total of some 2,500
were dead within a week. But victims continued to die for months, even
years afterwards, and health authorities estimate the disaster has been
directly responsible for a total of some 7,000 deaths.
