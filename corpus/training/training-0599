Japan's Current Account Surplus up 91.8 Percent in November 
Japan's current account surplus in November increased 91.8 percent from
a year earlier to 1,282.3 billion yen (about 9.64 billion U.S.
dollars), the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
The Ministry attributed the November increase to the decline in imports
and the services account deficit.
The November rise made it almost certain that, after three consecutive
years of decline, the politically sensitive current account surplus for
all of 1997 will exceed that of 1996.
Exports increased 6.1 percent to 4,093.3 billion yen (about 30.78
billion U.S. dollars), while imports declined 5.0 percent to 2,844.6
billion yen (about 21.4 billion U.S. dollars).
In goods and services trading in November Japan registered a surplus of
879.8 billion yen (about 6.6 billion U.S. dollars), up 187.6 percent
from a year before, the ministry said in a preliminary report.
The surplus in merchandise trade grew 44.6 percent to 1,248.7 billion
yen (about 9.4 billion U.S. dollars).
In service trade, including tourism, Japan posted a deficit of 368.9
billion yen (about 2.77 billion U.S. dollars), down from the 557.5
billion yen (about 4.19 billion U.S. dollars) deficit of a year
earlier.
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and services as
well as investment and other monetary transfers.
