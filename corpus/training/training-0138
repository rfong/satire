Thailand's Stimulus Package Aims to Boost Private Investment: Minister 
The Thai government's new stimulus package aims to boost private
investment in industrial sector, Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda said here Tuesday.
Tarrin said at a press conference after the cabinet approved the
package that import tariff cuts and reductions on raw industrial
materials will lower production costs of local industries and most of
the industrial enterprises will benefit from the cuts.
An equity fund worth about 500 million U.S. dollars will be set up to
invest in big businesses or restructure firms which are highly
competitive in the region, he said.
To boost the property sector, the government will extend loans to
buyers in middle and low income brackets, the minister said.
The package, jointly proposed by the Finance Ministry and Industry
Ministry, also included loans for small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is the third big economic program the Thai government has launched
in one year. Last August the government kicked off a package to help
banks recapitalize and on March 30 this year a plan was launched to
expand fiscal spending.
