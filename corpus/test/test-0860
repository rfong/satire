Syria-ously, I'm a foreign policy genius
By Kim Jong-il
There's an old saying in Korean, my dear readers: If you're right hand
is yanking on America's penis in exchange for fuel aid, your left hand
should be selling nuclear technologies to rogue nations. I think
Confucius said that. Confucius or Margaret Cho.
Some question my foreign policy objectives. To them, I say, "I like my
FP strategy like I like my women: bipolar and needy." And then I have
them taken to our barren agricultural fields and shot so that their
traitorous blood seeps into the Earth.
