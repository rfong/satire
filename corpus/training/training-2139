Hubble Space Telescope Finds Men From Venus, Women From Mars
Astrophysicists and self-help authors alike expressed
shock Friday when new data from the Hubble Space Telescope indicated
that, contrary to prior belief, men are from Venus and women are from
Mars. "Ever since Copernicus' Third Universal Law On Why Men Can't Cry,
scientists have believed the opposite, that men are from Mars and women
are from Venus," Chief NASA Engineer Stanley Fordham said. Hubble data
clearly indicates that Venus features an inhospitable atmosphere that
does not easily express its emotions and tends to hog the remote
control when watching TV. New spectrographic photographs of the Mars
surface, on the other hand, shows a sharing planet, open with its
emotions and very nurturing.
