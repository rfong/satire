Japan, US resume auto trade talks 
Japan and the United States held auto trade talks in Beijing Sunday,
resuming negotiations after a month and a half, a government official
said Monday.
Sozaburo Okamatsu, Japanese vice minister of international trade and
industry, met Jeffrey Garten, US commerce undersecretary for
international trade, for talks under the wide-ranging bilateral trade
framework, he said.
But the official did not disclose the content of their talks.
The subcabinet-level meeting preceded higher level talks between
Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
and US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, expected to take place in
Washington around September 7.
Auto trade is one of the three priority areas of the one-year framework
talks, along with insurance and government procurement.
