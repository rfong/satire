Instant noodle makers to aid in disaster relief
Instant noodle makers from 10 countries said Wednesday they had formed
an international association to promote their product, and would look
at ways of helping with disaster relief.
The International Ramen Manufacturers Association (IRMA) would provide
a forum "for the discussion of technical problems and environmental
issues relating to their business," they said in a statement, noting
that 40 billion packets of instant noodles were sold worldwide last
year.
"We believe that, as we approach the 21st century, instant ramen will
be recognised as one of the world's most important food products and
will contribute significantly to solving serious global problems such
as overpopulation and food shortages," the IRMA said.
Japanese businessman Momofuku Ando, who invented instant noodles in
1958, was elected chairman of the IMRA by 70 delegates attending the
inaugural World Ramen Summit in Tokyo.
The IRMA is to set up an industry information database within its Tokyo
headquarters, become involved in the study of industrial waste disposal
and formulate a standard in compliance with global food regulations.
It would also study "means for stockpiling and donating merchandise as
part of an effective rapid-response disaster and emrgency-relief
program."
"Ramen is a useful and effective product in time of emergency," said
IMRA director general Koki Ando, who is also president of the Japan
Convenience Foods Industry Association (JCFIA).
Ando said the IMRA would look at developing a process of stockpiling
and distribution whereby ramen could be supplied free to assist in
disaster relief around the world.
He said issues relating to instant noodles "are no longer unique to
Japan."
The second instant noodle summit is to be held in Indonesia in 1999.
The JCFIA said latest data showed 40.79 billion packets of instant
noodles were sold around the world in 1996, with China the largest
consumer, accounting for 15 billion packs.
Indonesia slurped down 7.97 billion packets, followed by Japan with
5.30 billion, South Korea 3.73 billion, the United States, 2.00
billion.
The association said Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines were emerging
as significant consumers of instant noodles.
Thailand ate 1.34 billion packets in 1996, the Philippines 1.04 billion
and Taiwan 840 million.
But different countries and cultures required a different approach.
Bill Stewart of Campbell Soup Co. of the United States, who said he was
"a very heavy end user," munching through two packets a day of the dry
noodles, told a news conference that US consumers preferred the noodles
in a block to be consumed with a meal rather than a snack-food cup.
Rudolf Tschan of Switzerland's Nestle SA said his company had to cater
to the differing tastes of 10 countries.
Shin Dong-Wong, president of Nong Shim Co. Ltd., said South Koreans
preferred the hot flavour of kimchi.
Leu Mao-Sheng, vice president of Taiwan's President Enterprises Corp,
said the comapny had to cater to widely different tastes from its 10
factories in China, one in Indonesia and one in Taiwan.
"There are substantially different preferences between say Shanghai and
Guangzhou," Leu said.
In the Philippines, Ubiversal Robina Corp. president James Go said that
while instant noodles in the cheaper block form accounted for 94
percent of sales, he expected the proportion of cup noodles sold, at
about five times the price, to increase in line with incomes.
