Yeltsin Alcohol Poisoning Mystery
In a surprising statement today Russian news agency TASS claimed that
former Soviet President Boris Yeltsin died from alcohol poisoning. They
are investigating a top pathologists claims that the alcohol may have
been administered over several years in small but lethal doses of
around 2 bottles a day.
It has formerly been claimed by Yeltsin's aides that alcohol fumes had
been detected on Yeltsin's breath on more than a few occasions leading
to suspicions being raised amongst his staff. As a result only Yeltsin
himself and a few trusted aides were allowed to prepare his food and "
Boris' special medicine " which he took for strictly medicinal reasons
every evening, morning and afternoon.
The KGB have launched an internal investigation after a trail of
alcohol traces were found in Yeltsin's home, local restaurants and
planes which Yeltsin is believed to have flown in. Several mini-bottles
of Stolichnaya Vodka were found by agents on a UK plane this morning,
leading to allegations of conspiracy from Yeltsin's camp.
Whatever the truth, this is an International incident that is sure to
rumble on.
"Buden Zdorovy!" as Yeltsin would have said.
