Rafsanjani urges army to prepare for possible attacks 
Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani called on his armed
forces Saturday to prepare for possible "enemy" attacks on the
anniversary of the start of the 1980-1988 war against neighboring Iraq.
"Iran's enemies have entered the foray in economic and cultural areas
and imposed an embargo on us to strike a blow," Rafsanjani said,
referring to the US economic sanctions imposed on Iran in June 1995 and
tightened in August.
"The army should be in a permanent state of defense as the enemies want
to impose an arms embargo on Iran," he said in a speech marking the
16th anniversary of the start of the war.
Iran organizes the "Defense Week" each year to commemorate the
1980-1988 war against Iraq and and for the first time since the end of
the conflict the country is holding military parades in various cities
this year.
"We should we ever vigilant because the enemies have not learned a
lesson from history," he told a crowd at Tehran's Azadi square, in
apparent allusion to the Iraqi invasion of its Kurdish-held north late
last month and the ensuing US missile attack on Iraq.
After Rafsanjani's speech, units of armoured divisions as well as
various ground-to-ground and ground-to-air missiles were paraded in
front of the official stand. But no new equipments were displayed.
Iraqi forces invaded Iran on September 21, 1980, more than one year
after the Shiite Moslem revolution here and ended eight years later in
a virtual stalemate.
