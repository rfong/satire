A power struggle that broke out this week in the executive ranks of the
Warner Music Group seemed to abate late Thursday, with Doug Morris
emerging as a winner over his boss, Robert J. Morgado, the chairman and
chief executive of the Warner Music Group, the world's biggest record
distributor and the most profitable arm of Time Warner Inc.
Company executives said that Morris, who in July was put in charge of
the company's three record groups, Warner Brothers, Elektra and
Atlantic Records, had a showdown with Morgado this week because he was
not allowed to run the labels as he saw fit.
At a meeting Wednesday with Time Warner chairman Gerald M. Levin,
Morris was said by executives to have threatened to quit if he had to
continue reporting to Morgado.
But late Thursday, Morris said he had ironed out his differences with
Morgado. ``Happy days are here again,'' said Morris, who built the
Atlantic group into Warner Music's biggest label before becoming
Morgado's No. 2. ``After a series of tense meetings, we have figured
out our roles and how to handle any overlap. I now have the authority
to grow the group like I grew Atlantic.''
As a symbol of his new power, Morris has a new title: Until Thursday he
was president and chief operating officer of Warner Music U.S.; now he
is chairman and chief executive.
In an oddly worded four-paragraph statement released at the close of
business Thursday, Morgado denied rumors of dissension within Warner
Music Group and said he had asked Morris to work at Warner Brothers
Records' headquarters in Burbank until a new chief executive was named.
The group's chairman, Mo Ostin, and its president, Lenny Waronker, the
group's top team for 12 years, are expected to leave the label. In
referring to Morris, Morgado used the new title, but never announced
that it had been changed.
Morris and Morgado have also resolved two other contentious subjects,
according to other executives close to the situation. Rob Dickins,
chairman of London-based Warner Music U.K., whom Morgado had favored to
succeed Ostin as head of Warner Brothers Records, will not be offered
the job. Morris, who is said to have objected to the selection, said he
would announce his choice as a label head next week.
But his first priority, he said, is to buy the 75 percent of Interscope
Records Inc. that Time Warner does not already own. Music executives
say that Morgado had objected to the price of the label Interscope, one
of the biggest start-up successes of the decade, with acts like Dr. Dre
and Snoop Doggy Dogg. Its value has been estimated at $300 million to
$400 million and both Sony Records and Polygram are said to have made
offers to Jimmy Iovine, cofounder of the label.
Currently, Interscope, which is based in Los Angeles, is part of
Atlantic Records, which, along with Elektra, has headquarters in New
York. Warner Brothers is based in Burbank, Calif.
But executives at Warner Music doubt that Morris and Morgado have truly
worked out all their differences. ``This is going to be a fight to the
death,'' one Warner Music executive said. ``No matter what kind of
rubber band, face-saving fix they put on this, there is no trust
between them. This is far from a stabilizing development. Artists are't
going to sign to a place with this much political infighting.''
After Waronker's surprise decision this week not to succeed Ostin as
chairman of Warner Brothers, several artists, including its biggest,
R.E.M., have expressed nervousness about staying with the company.
