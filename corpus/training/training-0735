Two Israelis, including a three-year-old girl, were killed when a
Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up outside a shopping mall in a
Tel Aviv suburb Monday, local police chief Yehuda Bacha told national

Bacha said the second victim was another child, but hospital officials
said it was an elderly woman.
More than 20 people were injured, at least five of them seriously,
officials said.
