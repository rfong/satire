The leprechauns are stalking me again
By Bono
Do not panic, self, there's nothing creeping up on you.
There! There's it is again! Did you see it? Bending over nonchalantly
looking for a four-leaf clover. It is a leprechaun. A leprechaun is
stalking me. This is, like, the third time this has happened.
I thought we settled all this during the Great Leprechaun War of '02. I
send them a fat check twice a year, they keep out of my way, everyone's
happy.
Come to think of it, I've been seeing way too many leprechauns in my
peripheral vision lately. When I'm in a crowd, signing autographs,
there've been little bearded red-haired dudes in ridiculous hats
glaring at me, shaking their heads disapprovingly.
Is he coming over this way? He is! Oh, goddammit. Think, Bono, think!
OK, I'm running. Ugh. I forgot how much I hate to move. Maybe if I drop
some change while fleeing, he'll stop to pick it up.
*pant pant pant*
My, he is fast.
