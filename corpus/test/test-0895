Sino-U.S. Operating Framework Agreement Signed in Beijing (2)
Both Randt and Askey said they hope that the reopening of the
cooperative programs in China, initiated in 1980 and suspended in 1989,
would contribute to the development of bilateral economic and trade
relations of the two countries.
The programs will facilitate China's economy in a positive way, they
said.
In response to journalists after the signing-ceremony, Sun Zhengyu said
that in the 1980s, dozens of TDA cooperative programs in China
contributed to the expansion of U.S. exports of technology and
equipment to China.
Sun added that the operating framework agreement and agreements on four
projects signed today will certainly promote the development of
bilateral trade and investment.
With China's successful bid for the Olympic Games and its upcoming
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the resumption of the
Sino-U.S trade cooperation will inevitably boost the two countries'
trade and investment, promoting the cooperation in energy resources,
environmental protection and telecommunications.
According to sources, TDA cooperative programs in China, starting at
the beginning of the 1980s and focusing on 45 items in 1980-1989,
pushed forward the bilateral cooperation in trade and investment.
For well-known reasons, Sino-U.S. cooperation in this field was
suspended in 1989. On January 13, 2001, the U.S. government declared
the resumption of the cooperative programs in China.
The Sino-U.S. Operating Framework Agreement and other agreements signed
today will play a constructive role in the bilateral cooperation in
energy resources, infrastructure and environmental protection
technology, the sources said.
