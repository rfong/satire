Ronaldo to See Himself on Bench 
Brazilian international Ronaldo was possible to see himself on the
substitutes' bench if the newly Player of the Year in 1997 could not
find his form to score, according to Inter Milan president Massimo
Moratti.
Ronaldo, who also winner of European player of the year, has ran
two-month scoring drought since early December.
"He's very young and it's only normal for him to go through a period
like this," Moratti said of the 21-year-old talent, on whom Inter spent
30 million U.S. dollars last summer.
"I don't think it's the solution, but I'm not the coach, that's for
(Gigi) Simoni to decide," Moratti added.
Ronaldo, who scored only 9 goals including two penaltes, will fight for
Inter in next league match against Brescia on Sunday.
Inter, which made a 11-4-2 record with 37 points, is one point trailing
to reigning champions Juventus.
