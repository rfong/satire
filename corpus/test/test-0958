Dennis Erickson was looking at the world Thursday through the eyes of
the NFL's newest head coach, and they were bloodshot.
A weary Erickson was introduced as coach of the Seahawks Thursday
afternoon, ending a whirlwind week of interviews and negotiations when
sleep was at a premium and anxiety was his constant companion.
``It's been awful. I haven't slept much,'' he said. ``It's easier to
make a decision when you're in your home environment. I've been 3,000
miles away in a motel room, and on the phone, because your family isn't
here to help you make it.''
The news conference where Seahawks president David Behring introduced
Erickson as the fifth head coach in franchise history was held at a
hotel in the San Francisco Bay area because Erickson is coaching the
East team in tomorrow's East-West Shrine game at Stanford University.
A week ago, Erickson was in Miami and had never met either Seahawks
owner Ken Behring or David Behring.
That all changed last Saturday, when the Behrings first interviewed
Erickson. Those talks also changed the future of the franchise, not to
mention altering the life of the former University of Miami coach who
grew up in Everett and always wondered what it would be like to coach
his hometown team.
``The decision was made right after my father and I spent four hours
with coach Erickson,'' David Behring said. ``We were extremely
impressed. He had the same philosophy as we did. We loved his
intensity. We loved the commitment he has to winning. He had so many
traits we were excited about that when he left we just made the
decision ... We wanted Dennis Erickson as our next coach.''
At times, the negotiation process seemed like childbirth, as the two
sides painfully narrowed the gap. The phone call that ultimately
delivered Erickson to the Seahawks came from Tom Condon, Erickson's
agent, at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday while David Behring was feeding his
newborn daughter, Stephanie, a bottle.
``The final objective was having him as our head coach,'' Behring said.
``He wanted it. We wanted it. That's when we knew we had finally
reached that objective.''
Erickson's five-year contract will pay him close to $5 million,
including incentives and revenue from radio and television shows. The
fifth year is an option year, which will be triggered by playoff
appearances.
Now that the Seahawks have the coach they wanted, and Erickson has the
only NFL job he said he would consider taking, it's time for Erickson
to start producing.
First on his agenda is compiling a staff. He already has hired eight
assistant coaches, including Bob Bratkowski, who will serve as his
offensive coordinator. Who his defensive coordinator will be remains in
question, because one of the stipulations of Erickson's hiring is that
he must add one with experience at the professional level. Erickson
hopes to have his staff completed in the next week or two.
``The key to a coaching staff is that you have people who are loyal to
you -- that they'll do anything for the organization and they'll do
anything for each other,'' Erickson said. ``If you don't have that,
you're not going to be successful.''
Once the staff is completed, the emphasis will switch to acquiring the
talent needed to run the pro-style offense and aggressive defense that
became Erickson's trademark at Miami. Erickson and his assistants will
attend the Senior Bowl later this month and the NFL scouting combine in
February.
The most pressing need is for wide receivers, and Behring said the
Seahawks plan to go after one in free agency and another in April's
college draft. Other areas of concern, Behring said, are guards, tight
ends and pass rushers.
Erickson said he sees Sam Adams, last year's first-round draft pick,
playing tackle next to Cortez Kennedy rather than splitting time at end
and tackle, as Adams did in his rookie season.
``We've got to let Cortez and Sam Adams get upfield. You can't get
overly complicated,'' Erickson said. ``We're going to be offensive on
defense.''
The NFL allows first-year coaches to hold three minicamps, and Erickson
said he will use his limit.
Erickson will be at the Seahawks' Kirkland headquarters Monday, then
plans to return to Miami for a week before moving into his new office
full time.
As for any decisions beyond that, Erickson wants to sleep on it.
