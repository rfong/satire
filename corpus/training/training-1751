Professor Bursts Bubble Of Leftover Champagne Lore Don't Put Cork
Richard Zare's thirst for knowledge led him to a sparkling discovery,
just in time for New Year's Eve: If you want to keep leftover champagne
bubbly, don't cork the bottle.
``The best thing may be to leave it alone and just return it to the
refrigerator ... unstopped,'' says the Stanford University chemistry
professor.
Zare, several colleagues and their spouses studied the admittedly minor
problem of storing unfinished bottles of sparkling wine.
Their findings burst the bubble on the European practice of dangling a
silver spoon in the neck of the bottle. And Zare's own hypothesis --
that recapping the bottle works best -- also went flat.
``To my surprise I found that recorking ... didn't do anything for it.
In fact, it got the worst result in terms of people's sense of taste,''
he said.
Makers of sparkling wine were amused -- but continued to recommend that
open bottles be restopped and returned to the refrigerator.
``But I think it sounds like a fun study,'' said Todd Graff, a
winemaker at Schramsberg Vineyards. He said many things affect
sparkling wine, which is properly called champagne only if it comes
from France's Champagne region.
Zare and Harold McGee, a noted writer on the science of food and
cooking, gathered six other tasters. They spent up to dlrs 200 of their
own money on sparkling wine, mostly from California.
The researchers found mixed results with the spoons. They gave the
highest rating to the wine left open for a day.
``That was a big surprise to me,'' Zare said. ``We found we liked the
bottles that had been allowed to stand better.''
Zare thinks bubbly, like some other wines, may benefit by being allowed
to ``breathe.'' This would dissipate any unsavory gases that may have
formed and increase the wine's contact with oxygen, aging it a bit
more.
He looks forward to resuming more testing of what he calls ``fizzics''
on New Year's Eve.
``This research doesn't cease,'' he said.
