Japan's KDD to expand Internet gateway to China, Malaysia: report 
Japan's biggest international telecommunications operator, Kokusai
Denshin Denwa (KDD), plans to expand its Internet "gateway" service to
China and Malaysia, a business newspaper reported Saturday.
KDD is negotiating with China's posts and telecommunications ministry
and Telekom Malaysia Bhd. on the new linkups, which could be launched
as early as September, the Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun said.
KDD started the "gateway" service in April. It links Internet providers
and other users in Japan via exclusive circuits with KDD's "gateway", a
central telecommunications facility. This transmits and receives data
to and from other such gateways overseas.
It is less expensive for users to access an Internet computer
communications network abroad through this type of service than through
an exclusive international circuit.
The KDD gateway service, dubbed Internet KDD, has so far linked its
lines with telecom operators in the United States, Singapore, Hong
Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.
