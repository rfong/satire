Iran Seizes 1.5 Tonnes of Narcotics 
Iranian security forces seized 1.5 tonnes of morphine and opium extract
from a truck loaded with bricks in the central Isfahan province, Iran's
official news agency IRNA reported today.
Commander of the provincial security forces Brigadier General Mohammad
Tayefi said six smugglers were arrested in the operation. He did not
give the date for the drug seizure.
Tayefi said that his forces seized 6.5 tonnes of various types of
narcotics during the first three quarters of the current Iranian year
(started March 21) and smashed 11 drug bands.
Drug trafficking poses a serious problem for the Iranian government.
Iran is one of the major transit routes for smugglers to ship narcotics
produced in the "Golden Crescent" in the border areas of Iran, Pakistan
and Afghanistan.
An Iranian anti-drug official earlier announced that the country
captured an average of 160 tonnes of various drugs annually since it
passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989 slapping capital punishment on
drug smugglers.
