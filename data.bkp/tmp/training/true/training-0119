Four/CD years/NNS ago/RB in/IN Nagano/NNP he/PRP only/RB managed/VBD bronze/NN ./.

This/DT time/NN ,/, in/IN what/WP is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB his/PRP$ last/JJ Winter/NNP Olympics/NNP ,/, he/PRP made/VBD no/DT mistake/NN ,/, snatching/VBG gold/NN from/IN under/IN the/DT nose/NN of/IN Switzerland/NNP 's/POS Christian/NNP Reich/NNP and/CC Martin/NNP Annen/NNP with/IN the/DT help/NN of/IN his/PRP$ brakeman/JJ Markus/NNP Zimmermann/NNP ./.

``/`` It/PRP was/VBD a/DT superb/JJ performance/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB a/DT problem/NN with/IN Markus/NNP coming/VBG in/IN but/CC maybe/RB he/PRP did/VBD because/IN he/PRP prepared/VBN for/IN the/DT four-man/JJ and/CC lost/JJ weight/NN and/CC then/RB he/PRP had/VBD to/TO put/VB it/PRP on/IN again/RB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Langen/NNP ./.

``/`` We/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT good/JJ team/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VBP only/RB Markus/NNP could/MD have/VB come/VBN in/IN like/IN that/DT ./.

The/DT pair/NN went/VBD into/IN the/DT fourth/JJ and/CC final/JJ round/NN tied/VBN for/IN pole/JJ position/NN with/IN Reich/NNP ,/, but/CC put/VBD in/IN an/DT electric/JJ run/NN down/RB the/DT lightning/NN quick/JJ Utah/NNP Olympic/NNP Park/NNP track/VBP to/TO finish/VB .09/CD seconds/NNS ahead/RB with/IN an/DT aggregate/JJ time/NN of/IN 3mins/JJ 10.11/CD secs/NNS ./.
