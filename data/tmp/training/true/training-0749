The/DT Knight/NNP Commission/NNP on/IN Intercollegiate/NNP Athletics/NNP warned/VBD college/NN presidents/NNS Tuesday/NNP against/IN backsliding/VBG on/IN academic/JJ standards/NNS for/IN college/NN players/NNS ./.

Ending/VBG two/CD days/NNS of/IN meetings/NNS here/RB ,/, the/DT national/JJ commission/NN urged/VBD college/NN officials/NNS to/TO stand/VB firm/NN behind/IN the/DT NCAA/NNP 's/POS stiffer/JJR eligibility/NN requirements/NNS for/IN freshmen/NNS athletes/NNS for/IN implementation/NN in/IN 1995/CD ./.

Opponents/NNS of/IN the/DT tougher/JJR requirements/NNS ,/, including/VBG some/DT coaches/NNS ,/, have/VBP said/VBD some/DT poor/JJ and/CC minority/NN athletes/NNS could/MD be/VB denied/VBN a/DT chance/NN at/IN a/DT college/NN education/NN because/RB of/IN the/DT new/JJ rules/NNS ./.

The/DT new/JJ standards/NNS ,/, called/VBN Proposition/NNP 16/CD ,/, would/MD require/VB incoming/JJ athletes/NNS to/TO have/VB had/VBN at/IN least/JJS a/DT 2.5/CD grade/NN point/NN average/NN in/IN 13/CD high/JJ school/NN core/NN subjects/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO participate/VB in/IN sports/NNS during/IN their/PRP$ freshman/NN years/NNS ./.

Under/IN the/DT current/JJ Proposition/NNP 48/CD ,/, a/DT 2.0/JJ overall/JJ grade/NN point/NN average/NN is/VBZ required/VBN ./.

Both/DT propositions/NNS require/VBP a/DT combined/VBN score/NN of/IN at/IN least/JJS 700/CD on/IN the/DT Scholastic/NNP Assessment/NNP Test/NNP ./.

``/`` The/DT Knight/NNP Commission/NNP has/VBZ unbounded/VBN faith/NN that/IN all/DT young/JJ athletes/NNS will/MD rise/VB ,/, including/VBG African-American/JJ athletes/NNS ,/, to/TO meet/VB the/DT challenge/NN of/IN higher/JJR standards/NNS ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Rev./NNP Theodore/NNP Hesburgh/NNP ,/, commission/NN co-chair/NN and/CC president/NN emeritus/NN of/IN the/DT University/NNP of/IN Notre/NNP Dame/NNP ./.

The/DT NCAA/NNP will/MD discuss/VB the/DT new/JJ requirements/NNS at/IN its/PRP$ convention/NN in/IN January/NNP in/IN San/NNP Diego/NNP ./.

The/DT Knight/NNP Commission/NNP has/VBZ no/DT official/JJ role/NN at/IN the/DT convention/NN ,/, but/CC five/CD of/IN its/PRP$ members/NNS are/VBP college/NN presidents/NNS with/IN NCAA/NNP votes/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PRP 'm/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN if/IN we/PRP set/VBD a/DT higher/JJR standard/NN ,/, you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO worry/VB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Leroy/NNP Walker/NNP ,/, a/DT Knight/NNP commissioner/NN and/CC president/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP Olympic/NNP Committee/NNP ./.

If/IN players/NNS can/MD ``/`` run/VB ,/, shoot/VB and/CC guard/VB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, they/PRP can/MD also/RB study/VB and/CC meet/VB the/DT tougher/JJR academic/JJ requirements/NNS ./.

``/`` It/PRP is/VBZ unfortunate/JJ that/IN this/DT entire/JJ debate/NN has/VBZ encouraged/VBN the/DT idea/NN that/IN access/NN to/TO higher/JJR education/NN for/IN minority/NN Americans/NNS depends/VBZ on/IN athletic/JJ scholarships/NNS ,/, said/VBD Hesburgh/NNP ./.

He/PRP noted/VBD that/IN only/RB ``/`` 1.2/CD percent/NN of/IN 1.2/CD million/CD African-American/JJ undergraduates/NNS depend/VBP on/IN athletic/JJ scholarships/NNS to/TO support/VB their/PRP$ education/NN ./. ''/''

The/DT Commission/NNP reported/VBD that/IN there/EX are/VBP more/JJR African-American/JJ student/NN athletes/NNS are/VBP participating/VBG in/IN college/NN sports/NNS today/NN than/IN before/IN 1982/CD ,/, when/WRB Proposition/NNP 48/CD went/VBD into/IN effect/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB it/PRP to/TO sound/VB like/IN a/DT black/JJ and/CC white/JJ issue/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Hesburgh/NNP ./.

``/`` It/PRP is/VBZ about/IN athletes/NNS ./. ''/''

Funded/VBN by/IN the/DT John/NNP S./NNP and/CC James/NNP L./NNP Knight/NNP Foundation/NNP ,/, the/DT Knight/NNP Commission/NNP was/VBD established/VBN in/IN 1990/CD ./.

After/IN meeting/NN with/IN coaches/NNS ,/, college/NN presidents/NNS ,/, athletes/NNS ,/, athletic/JJ directors/NNS ,/, and/CC others/NNS involved/VBN in/IN college/NN sports/NNS ,/, it/PRP issued/VBD a/DT 1991/CD report/NN urging/VBG reforms/NNS ./.

Coca-Cola/NNP president/NN Donald/NNP Keough/NNP and/CC former/JJ Heisman/NNP Trophy/NNP winner/NN Dick/NNP Kazmaier/NNP are/VBP current/JJ members/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP also/RB joined/VBD the/DT NCAA/NNP in/IN supporting/VBG the/DT concept/NN of/IN partial/JJ qualifiers/NNS ./.

Under/IN those/DT guidelines/NNS ,/, players/NNS would/MD be/VB admitted/VBN to/TO college/NN but/CC prohibited/VBN from/IN competition/NN in/IN their/PRP$ freshmen/NNS year/NN and/CC restricted/VBN to/TO only/RB three/CD years/NNS of/IN eligibility/NN ./.
