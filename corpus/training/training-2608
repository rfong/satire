Croat Serb rebels name new military chief 
Croat Serb General Mile Mrksic was named the new head of rebel Serb
forces in Croatia on Tuesday, the Serbs' ISKRA news agency reported.
The rebel Serbs' supreme defense council said that Mrksic would replace
General Milan Celeketic, 49, who tendered his resignation as commander
of the Krajina Serbs' troops to rebel leader Milan Martic on Monday.
Celeketic had said in a letter to Martic that he "no longer had the
moral force necessary" to carry out his duties since Croatian
government troops recaptured western Slavonia from the Serbs earlier
this month.
Celeketic blamed political leaders of the separatist Serb Republic of
Krajina, of which western Slavonia is a part, for the loss.
The resignation was a first public sign of tension between political
and military leaders since Serb forces lost western Slavonia to
Croatian army troops.
The Serb rebel parliament is due to meet Thursday in the Krajina
capital of Knin although some deputies have called for it to be moved
to the far eastern edge of western Slavonia where it began May 2 before
it was adjourned due to Croatia's offensive.
