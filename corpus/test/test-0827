Sectarian violence in Pakistani border town claims 97 lives 
At least 97 people have died and 89 wounded in five days of gunbattles
between Sunni and Shia Moslems in the northwestern town of Parachinar,
Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar said Sunday.
A curfew was imposed Tuesday in the town on the Afghan border after
students of rival sects clashed. The minister said Parachinar had been
sealed off to prevent "outside interference."
"I admit we have failed" in Parachinar, Babar told parliament as
opposition deputies lashed out at the government over the violence.
An opposition deputy Asfandyar Wali, stressing the violence claimed 267
casualties, said the situation in the sensitive area was getting worse
due to Sunni-Shia clashes.
Babar said the situation had been brought under control and normal life
was returning to Parachinar.
