Japanese Red Army fugitive extradited to her country 
Kazue Yoshimura, a fugitive member of Japan's Red Army, boarded a plane
back home late Wednesday, after President Alberto Fujimori ordered her
extradition, Lima airport officials said.
Yoshimura, 49, was arrested here on May 25 for entering the country
under a false identity.
She had been on an international wanted list for 22 years and is
suspected of taking part in a 1974 attack on the French embassy in The
Hague to demand the release of a fellow Red Army member in France.
Peruvian authorities had earlier speculated that Yoshimura may have
been in Peru to deliver money to Peruvian insurgencies, but was cleared
of suspicion by investigators.
"She has not been found to have any ties to (Peru's Maoist) Shining
Path or MRTA (Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement), and was found only
to have violated migration laws," General Carlos Dominguez, chief of
the anti-terrorist force DINCOTE, said Wednesday when Yoshimura was
shown off to local and international reporters.
Dominguez said Yoshimura arrived in Peru three years ago as a
Philippine tourist named Conny Perez, but when arrested claimed to be
Yoko Okuyama, a 47-year-old Ecuadoran of Japanese background.
Fujimori made the decision to extradite after she was identified here
with fingerprints sent from Japan.
Yoshimura, who fainted during her meeting with reporters, refused food
after she was detained, police said, but would neither confirm nor deny
press reports that she had cancer.
Interpol-Lima indicated Yoshimura was a liaison between the Red Army
and terrorist groups in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East.
The arrest in Peru came two months after Yoshimi Tanaka, a Red Army
hijacker thought to be living in North Korea, was detained in Cambodia
and transferred to Thailand where he faces charges of currency
counterfeiting.
An estimated 14 Red Army members are still at large. One top leader,
Fusako Shigenobu, is thought be living in Lebanon.
