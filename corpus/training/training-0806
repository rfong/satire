North Korea's trade down 6.1 pct 
North Korea's trade volume shrank 6.1 percent in the first half of this
year to 930 million dollars, mainly due to drastic falls in deals with
Russia and China, the Seoul government said Wednesday.
The National Unification Board (ministry) said North Korea's exports
for the first six months to June were estimated at 250 million dollars,
down 30.6 percent from the same period last year.
But imports rose 7.9 percent to 680 million dollars, the NUB said.
The 430 million dollar trade deficit for the six-months was 160 million
higher than for the same period last year.
The snowballing deficit was attributed to North Korea's failing
socialist economy.
Last year, the North's exports fell from 1.02 billion dollars in 1993
to 840 million dollars, while imports took a deeper dive to 1.27
billion dollars from 1.62 billion dollars.
North Korea posted a negative economic growth of minus 1.7 percent in
1994, the fifth consecutive year of economic decline, South Korea's
central Bank of Korea said.
