Thunder Showers Cool Northern Port City 
Thunder showers Thursday cooled down the largest port city in north
China, which has been suffering high temperatures and severe drought
since the beginning of summer.
According to the local meteorological station, the showers, which
lasted from Wednesday evening to Thursday morning and stimulated by
artificial efforts, brought about an average 36.2 millimeters of
rainfall to the city, including 12 of its suburban districts.
This is the first rain of the summer, to be followed by another in the
next one or two days, believed to be helpful for alleviating drought,
which hit the city for the fifth consecutive year.
