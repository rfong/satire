Thai Ministry to Readjust Health Strategy 
The Thai Ministry of Public Health is reassessing the country's health
and disease trends for the coming years under a new economic situation.
The ministry had expected a booming economy and prepared for the
so-called rich people's diseases, such as obesity and heart diseases.
However, with a general economic slump, the ministry has to focus on
more basic and common diseases, such as malnutrition and communicable
diseases.
Besides, the health sector also has to cope with increasing cases of
mental problems, like stress and depression, Dr. Narongsak
Angkhasuvaphala, deputy permanent secretary for the ministry said.
In addition, state hospitals need to prepare themselves for a large
increase of patients, as more people will switch from expensive private
hospitals to state ones for cheaper treatment.
He also urged state hospitals to reduce spending on expensive medical
equipment and avoid unnecessary distribution of drugs like antibiotics,
according to the Bangkok Post Sunday.
