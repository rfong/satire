Breaking the chains of labor strife that have linked Major League
Baseball and the National Hockey League in unprecedented shutdowns, the
National Basketball Association and its players proclaimed eight months
of labor peace Thursday and pledged to play their season while trying
to forge a lasting agreement.
Commissioner David Stern and Charles Grantham, the union chief,
acknowledged the difficult task ahead, but they said they hoped their
no-lockout, no-strike agreement would create an atmosphere conducive to
productive talks and long-term peace.
The league's salary cap, on the other hand, may create an
insurmountable barrier in the way of that goal. The league wants to
eliminate loopholes in the cap; the union wants to eliminate the cap.
But the system remains in place for the season.
The agreement, which the two sides intensively negotiated during the
previous few days, left a question that never will be answered: Would
the owners have locked out the players before the start of the season
next Friday, or was Stern bluffing in the hope that he could avoid a
work stoppage during the season and the playoffs and play under the
existing salary-cap system?
``The stakes are too high here,'' Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner,
said when asked after the news conference about a possible bluff.
``That's not the case. The board would have had a tough decision. We
could very well have been in that situation.''
He referred to a Board of Governors' meeting that had been scheduled
for next Monday in Chicago. The owners had been expected to take a
lockout vote if no agreement had been reached by then, but some
management people and some agents were highly skeptical that Stern
would have locked out the players.
One agent, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he spoke
Wednesday with two general managers who, when a possible lockout was
mentioned, were surprised. ``They didn't expect a lockout,'' the agent
said.
The agreement, which Stern and Grantham signed shortly after 2 p.m. on
Thursday at the Sheraton Manhattan Hotel, included other elements
besides the owners' pledge not to lock out and the players' pledge not
to strike. The other elements represented compromises from Stern's
initial proposal that he had made several days earlier.
The two sides agreed to a moratorium on renegotiated contracts or
contract extensions from Nov. 8 through the end of the playoffs. The
league had wanted the moratorium to begin immediately but agreed to a
window from now until Nov. 8. The union's agreement to the moratorium
was viewed by people involved in the NBA and other sports as a major
compromise, or concession.
The union also agreed to a stay of legal action through the end of the
playoffs. That element involved a case in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Manhattan dealing with several league issues: the salary
cap; the right of first refusal for free agents, the college draft and
the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan last Monday on
behalf of David Wood of Golden State and Howard Eisley of Minnesota
over the league's reduction of the salary cap for this season.
The league initially wanted the union to induce the two players to drop
their lawsuit completely, but Grantham balked at restricting players'
individual rights. The league subsequently asked for a stay of the
suit.
``Ultimately,'' said Jeffrey Kessler, the lawyer representing Wood and
Eisley, ``my players thought it was in the best inerest of everyone to
agree to that. We were not surprised that the NBA was afraid of this
case and remains afraid of this case. We think it establishes they have
a significant damage exposure, not just to these two players but to all
players who sign this year.''
In the union's appeal of the federal court decision that the salary cap
and the other issues are covered by labor laws and not antitrust laws,
the two sides agreed that either could appeal the appellate court
decision after it is issued but that no hearing, if applicable, would
be conducted until the end of the NBA season.
A lawyer involved in baseball said he thought the league got a very
good deal. ``They got a moratorium on signing while the union agreed
not to strike,'' he said. ``The no-strike pledge might have made sense
without the other two elements.''
Whether or not the agreement benefits one side or the other, the
flourishing NBA and its players will proceed with their season, with
both sides benefiting from the mushrooming revenue the league generates
on a multitude of fronts.
