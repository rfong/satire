What do Britney Spears and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have in common? They
both blog regularly at News Groper, as do more that 50 other
celebrities, politicians, business moguls, and foreign despots. You can
download free mask of both the over-the-hill queen of pop and the
Iranian president at News Groper and check out our list of illustrious
parody bloggers for the latest commentary on the news by the newsmakers

Our writers have graciously asked that we share their masks of with

mighty. Check back again soon for more masks. We'd love to see what you
do with them. Take some photos and send them our way.
