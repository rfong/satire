Tajik ministers attend opening of Japanese embassy 
Tajikistan Prime Minister Akil Akilov and a special envoy from Japanese
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Muneo Suzuki, attended the opening of
a new Japanese embassy in Dushanbe Wednesday.
Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov also attended the opening which he
hailed as a "major political event" in relations between the two
countries.
Japan's is the third diplomatic representation to open in the Tajik
capital in the past two months.
Suzuki noted that despite the ousting of the fundamentalist Taliban
regime in neighbouring Afghanistan, the threat of terrorism was "far
from ended" and cooperation between their countries would be
"strategically useful."
The envoy arrived in Dushanbe Tuesday and was scheduled for talks with
President Emomali Rakhmonov and other senior Tajik and United Nations
officials.
