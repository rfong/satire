DPRK, South Korean Leaders Highly Evaluate Summit
Leaders of the North and the South of the Korean Peninsula have hailed
the inter-Korea summit as helpful to the national reunification before
President Kim Dae- jung winds up his historic visit to Pyongyang
Thursday.
At a banquet hosted by Kim Dae-jung in Pyongyang Wednesday, Kim Yong
Nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), said the summit has
"showed a good sign of national unity to the fellow countrymen."
During the summit between DPRK leader Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae- jung,
which started Tuesday, the two sides discussed national problems
earnestly and came to understand each other, he noted, adding the
politicians of Korea can pool all their wisdom and energies to make
reunification a work to be undertaken right now.
Kim Yong Nam said he believes that the Pyongyang visit of Kim Dae-jung
will help achieve the country's reunification, the cherished desire of
the whole nation.
He said the two days of the summit were meaningful days during which
"years of too long separation seemed to be forgotten during the too
short meeting and talks because of compatriotic feelings."
In his speech, Kim Dae-jung described the summit as "a great auspicious
event" to be rejoiced over by the whole Korean nation and the first
historic inspiring action in 55 years of division.
He said he fully agreed with the statement made by Kim Jong Il during
his recent Chinese visit that the issue of the Korean Peninsula should
be solved by the Korean people themselves. "I am also sure that the
destiny of our nation can be carved out by the Korean nation itself,"
he added.
The South Korean president said he was confident that the South-North
summit talks were the starting-point for peace and reunification, the
cherished desire of the 70 million Koreans.
He thanked Kim Jong Il for the warm reception and hospitality accorded
to him.
The second day of the summit ended Wednesday with the signing of a
joint communique containing the historic agreement on the issues of
reconciliation and cooperation, easing of tension and national
unification, reunion of separated families and broad exchanges in
economic and social sectors.
Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-jung are expected to have lunch together before
the South Korean president leaves for home Thursday.
Kim Dae-jung is likely to fly home Thursday afternoon instead of, as
previously scheduled, returning by car through the tiny truce village
of Panmunjom, a symbol of the division of the Korean Peninsula.
