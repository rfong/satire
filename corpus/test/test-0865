Hungary's Foreign Exchange Reserve Hits Record High 
Hungary's foreign exchange reserve has reached a record high of 11.8
billion U.S. dollars, announced Deputy-Chairman of the National Bank
Harshegyi Frigyes at a press conference today.
Frigyes explained that the increase in the reserve was due mainly to
last year's record high privatization income of 3.5 billion dollars.
The foreign exchange reserve was less than 7 billion dollars at the
start of 1995.
The reserve is set to decrease because Hungary will pay off foreign
debts of 3 billion U.S. dollars by April, he added.
