Turkey to Impose Heavier Penalties on Torture Offenders 
Turkey has finished the first leg of a legislative process which, when
completed, will introduce tougher penalties on torture offenders.
The Parliament's Justice Commission approved on Tuesday a bill
providing a wider definition of torture and increasing the maximum
prison terms for those convicted of committing torture offenses from
the current five years to eight years, the local Daily News reported
Wednesday.
Attempts by some commission members to limit the definition of
"torture" and soften sentences on such cases were dashed by the
majority of the commission members after Justice Minister Hikmet Sami
Turk said the penalties foreseen by the law should serve as a
deterrent.
It is impossible to fight torture with a law that provides a maximum
six-month prison term for civil servants sentenced for committing
torture, said the minister.
He also opposed suggestions by a sub-committee that torture should not
be listed as a crime that deserves a heavy penalty, thus enabling
offenders to return to work after serving a six-month prison term.
The maximum sentence of six years and minimum sentence of six months
suggested by the sub-committee could not be considered as punishment
but an encouragement for torture, said the minister.
He added the minimum sentences for such offenses should not be less
than one year behind bars and expulsion from the profession.
The draft, approved by the Justice Commission of the Parliament, needs
to be passed by the entire parliament before it can enter into force.
