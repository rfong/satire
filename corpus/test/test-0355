Crime Plan Targets Phone Thefts in Britain 
British Home Secretary Jack Straw Wednesday launched a crackdown on
mobile phone thefts in an effort to tackle rising levels of street
crime.
A summit is being organized with police and industry leaders who will
be pressed to improve security features on handsets.
The initiative includes the distribution of a special crime- fighting
"tool kit" to police and local communities.
But critics have dismissed it as a "gimmick", saying the government
should concentrate on increasing police numbers.
Experts say mobile phone thefts are now common on UK streets because,
despite their prevalence, they are desirable and easy to snatch.
But their high cost means thefts are more likely to be reported than
other street robberies.
The home secretary and senior police officers believe this has fueled
the 11 percent rise in violent incidents shown in the latest figures
despite an overall drop in crime.
Straw said he wanted to see the mobile phone industry follow the
example over the past decade of car manufacturers who, after a
reluctant start, dramatically improved vehicle security.
Straw insisted that with increased funds provided by the government,
better targeting and better intelligence, violent crime would be
reduced.
