Southern China's Guangdong Province is enhancing the development of
environmentally friendly products for the benefit of ecological
protection.
According to the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Environmental
Protection, there are now 676 enterprises with 57,000 employees
engaging in the production of environmentally friendly equipment.
Last year, the value of the production in the Province's sector reached
nearly three billion yuan.
An official of the bureau said that of the output value, two-thirds
goes to the production of equipment for processing wastes and
regenerating resources.
He said there are now 325 products for this purpose with annual profits
of more than 200 million yuan.
He said that some products for environmental protection are exported to

Hong Kong and Taiwan.
The technology for manufacturing environmental protection equipment in
Guangdong has reached an advanced level in the world, he said,
including technology for water processing and equipment to fight
pollution in electrolytic dust.
