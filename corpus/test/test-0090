Zimbabweans Urged to Preserve Cultural Heritage 
Zimbabwean Mines, Environment and Tourism Minister Simon Moyo Friday
challenged Zimbabweans to promote their cultural heritage and not to
concentrate only on marketing wildlife and natural resources.
Closing a two-day seminar on cultural tourism in Harare, Moyo said that
the potential for cultural tourism in Zimbabwe is vast to meet the
demands for the tourist market.
He commended the efforts made by tourism industry to promote ethnic and
other traditional attributes.
"While we intensify our efforts to promote our cultural tourism, we
must uphold the dignity of our society which is also important for
tourism, without destroying the uniqueness of the customs of our ethnic
groups, their varied culture and handcrafts," he stressed.
Moyo said his ministry welcomed public and private sector organizations
to help in implementing the tourism master plan which will formulate a
policy framework for the country's future development of tourism.
