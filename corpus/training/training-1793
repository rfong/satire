Palestinians Protest in West Bank Against Closure 
Palestinians staged demonstrations in different towns of West Bank
today to protest the total closure imposed by Israel, JMCC, an
East-Jerusalem based Palestinian news service reported.
Thousands of Palestinians took to the streets in Bethlehem, Nablus,
Kalkiarm, Ramallah and other cities, venting their anger over the siege
and demanded Israel to lift the blockade as soon as possible, JMCC
said.
In Ramallah, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat met with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
the two discussed issues of the stalled Middle East peace process and
ways and means of its revitalization.
Albright arrived in the region Wednesday on a special Middle East tour
aimed at getting the Middle East peace process back on track.
The Palestinian protesters also voiced their discontent with Albright's
press statement on Wednesday in Jerusalem in which she stressed too
much that PNA must take concrete actions to fight terrorism, the report
said.
The demonstrations were peaceful, but in some places people burned U.S.
flags and photos of Albright to expressed their anger over her pledged
support Wednesday to Israel economically and militarily, the report
added.
Israel reimposed a total closure on Palestinian self-rule territories
on September 4 following a triple suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market
that killed eight people, including three bombers, and injured more
than 190 other.
