ANA to resume Nagoya-Honolulu service in February
Japan's All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. (ANA) plans to reopen its
Nagoya-Honolulu route in February after a four-year break, the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun reported Saturday.
ANA hopes the reopening of the route linking central Japan and Hawaii
will help it in its bid to get approval from Japan and the United
States to open Tokyo-Honolulu and Osaka-Honolulu routes, the major
business daily said.
The company's plan to resume the service has been in limbo because of
stalled Japan-US aviation talks, the daily said.
ANA opened the Nagoya-Honolulu route in September 1991, flying three
times a week.
But the company stopped the service in March 1993 in the face of
intense competition from rival Japan Airlines Co. Ltd. and Northwest
Airlines of the United States, which fly seven days a week.
The company plans to apply to the transport ministry by early October
for approval to resume the service, offering seven flights a week this
time, the paper said.
