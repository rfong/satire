Lawyer poised to win Bulgarian presidency by Vesela Sergeva 
A 44-year-old lawyer known as a moderate and conservative is poised for
a sweeping victory in the second round of Bulgaria's presidential
elections Sunday.
Petar Stoyanov, who describes himself as the spokesman for "a new
majority of the impoverished and those who fear they will become so,"
won 44 percent of the vote in the first round on October 27.
His opponent, Ivan Marazov, is minister of culture in the current
Socialist government. His poor 27-percent showing in the first round of
voting last week was widely attributed to the Socialists' poor
management of the economy since they were returned to power in December
1994.
The presidency is a largely ceremonial post voters are not expected to
turn out in numbers.
Marazov, a 54-year-old Hellenist scholar, tried during the campaign to
distance himself from the government, painting himself as more of a
researcher than a politician.
While Marazov has called for a referendum on whether Bulgaria should
seek to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Stoyanov ardently
advocates signing up to both NATO and the European Union. Stoyanov is a
strong advocate of the in-depth reforms that Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic have undertaken -- and Bulgaria's former Communists have
shunned.
Stoyanov, like Marazov, has little experience in government. He was
deputy justice minister in a conservative minority government that
lasted 11 months in 1991-92, while Marazov was deputy culture minister
before he became culture minister only last June.
Stoyanov boasts endorsements from personalities ranging from former
king Simeon II to football star Christo Stoichkov and German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. In a presidential primary election last June, Stoyanov
defeated President Zhelev, whose term ends in January.
The dismal showing of the Socialists, most of whom are ex-Communists,
in the first round has prompted calls from within the Socialist Party
for the resignation of Prime Minister Zhan Videnov. A party congress is
likely after the second round.
Ivan Kostov, the leader of the conservative coalition known as the
Union of Democratic Forces, of which Stoyanov is deputy leader, said a
strong Stoyanov victory would lead the UDF to launch a campaign for
anticipated elections.
The current single-chamber parliament's term expires in December 1998.
Marazov had initially been picked as a vice-presidential candidate by
Foreign Minister Georgi Pirinski, but had to replace him when the
constitutional court ruled that Pirinski could not run because he did
not fill the constitutional requirement of being Bulgarian-born.
Marazov in turn picked the deputy foreign minister, Irina Bokova, as
his running mate, and appeared with her at virtually every campaign
appearance.
