Kucinich likens GOP's backing of Bush to Exxon Mobil's hiring of Exxon
Valdez skipper
Philadelphia - (Excoriating Mess): The 2000 backing of George W Bush as
the GOP's official Big Oil gunslinger has been likened by perennial
Democatic presidential wannabe Dennis Kucinich to Exxon Mobil's hiring
of Captain Joseph Hazlewood, the drunk behind the Exxon Valdez
disaster.
"The GOP knew that this psychopathic dry drunk has serious mental
health problems linked to a lifetime of cocaine and alcohol abuse," the
Dems' stalwart said in Philadelphia today.
"They placed this relapsed junkie, who they knew was using and drinking
in public orifice, in command of an enormous NATO member state,
carrying a toxic cargo of bent and twisted military intelligence across
treacherous and resource-rich Bedouin oilfields."
Kuninich's words have echoed those of the US District Court judge who
awarded damages of $2.5 billion against Exxon Mobil after hearing
evidence of their employment of the drunk skipper in charge of the
Valdez tanker which caused over $5billion of environmental damage in
Prince William Sound in 1989:
"Exxon placed a relapsed alcoholic, who it knew was drinking aboard its
ships, in command of an enormous vessel carrying toxic cargo across
treacherous and resource-rich waters," was the official adjudication in
the Exxon Valdex case, now spookily echoing at a Philadelphia rally
where Kucinich has warned about Bush's mental capacities.
"Virtually the same moronic scenario," Kucinich added today.
