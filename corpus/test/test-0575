ASSAD STILL WANTS PEACE WITH ISRAEL BEFORE YEAR'
American diplomats said Tuesday that Syrian President Hafez Assad still
hoped to sign a peace agreement with Israel by the end of this year, a
goal that has also been set by President Clinton.
A senior administration official traveling with Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said Assad had told the secretary that he still
wanted to meet the objective he announced in January of achieving peace
with Israel this year -- a goal that many Middle East experts thought
had slipped because of the slow pace of indirect peace talks.
In his most detailed comments yet about the Syrian-Israeli talks,
Christopher spoke of slow but steady progress, involving interlocking
issues, many of which will fall into place only when others are
settled.
In a news conference aboard his plane en route from Israel to a
refueling stop in Ireland, Christopher added that the two sides ``were
not utterly self-absorbed.'' He added, ``They were thinking about what
the needs of the other party were.''
From Christopher's remarks, it was clear that the early stages of the
indirect peace talks were over, and that Israel and Syria were now
testing each other to determine what the other side's bottom line was
-- which issues were most important to the other side, and which issues
the other side might be most willing to compromise on.
Christopher and his aides indicated that the two sides had stopped
playing a psychological game in which each side dug in and insisted
that its negotiating partner make the first concession.
Christopher, who also visited Damascus and Jerusalem three weeks ago,
said: ``I felt my last trip had removed some of the major psychological
barriers. There was less testing between the parties and more
down-to-earth discussion. I found in this conversation there was a very
conscientious searching on both sides as to the needs of the other
parties.''

American officials have often said the broad outlines of a peace accord
are there: Israel has tentatively offered to withdraw from the Golan
Heights in exchange for a comprehensive peace with Syria.
But myriad details still need to be worked out about security
arrangements, borders, the scope of a full peace and the timing and
phases of carrying out a peace accord.
During his five-day trip to the Middle East -- his fourth in three
months -- Christopher carried some new Israeli ideas to Damascus and,
after meeting with Assad, conveyed some of the Syrian leader's latest
thinking to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
``There is a good deal for them to chew on as we leave the region,''
Christopher said, noting that sizable gaps remained between the two
sides. ``They are at a very meaningful level of discussion at this
time.''
In a news conference Monday, Rabin also indicated that he thought that
Assad was intent on achieving peace. He said, ``Syria wants peace --
the problem is the price, the timing, the timetables.''
A senior official aboard Christopher's plane said that while Assad has
indicated that he had made a strategic choice for peace, the Syrian
leader would not accept peace at any price.
``Each side,'' the official said, ``is trying to determine whether they
can pay the price they are being asked for by the other and whether the
price is worth it.''
The senior official, who insisted on anonymity, described the talks as
``far more detailed than before,'' adding that they had taken on a more
inquiring character.
``They're not just trying to deal with each issue in isolation,'' this
official said. ``They're much more intent on seeing how each issue will
fit together. It will be a time-consuming process.''
