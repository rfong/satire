Thai Exports Slump 14.2 Percent in July 
Thai exports in July declined by 14.2 percent from the year before to
5.143 billion dollars, continuing a trend that is dragging down
economic activity, the Bank of Thailand announced Friday.
At the same time, Thai imports totaled 5.146 billion U.S. dollars,
which resulted in a deficit of 3 million U.S. for the month, the
central bank said.
Atchana Waiquamdee, senior director of the Monetary Policy Group, was
quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying that activity in manufacturing,
agriculture and fisheries all posted declines in July because of the
global economic slide.
But she cautioned that the July export decline, the largest of the year
to date, was from a high base last year.
The central bank projects a 4 percent fall in exports this year,
assuming no improvement in the fourth quarter. The Thailand Development
Research Institute expects a 6.9 percent fall to 63.46 billion U.S.
dollars.
