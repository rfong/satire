Leeson pleaded guilty to charges "only answerable in the UK": lawyer 
The rogue securities trader Nick Leeson, blamed for the collapse of
Barings bank, made a full confession to British fraud police last week
of the crimes that led to the bank's bankruptcy, his lawyer Stephen
Pollard said here on Tuesday.
Leeson, who is currently fighting extradition to Singapore, had made "a
full and categoric admission" of charges, that "go to the very heart of
the collapse of Barings", his lawyer said.
These charges, Pollard added, which include Leeson's most serious crime
of deceiving management in London into sending vast funds to Singapore
at the begining of this year to cover margin payments on his escalating
losses, "are only answerable in the UK".
But the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which last week sent three
representatives to interview Leeson in his German prison cell, has made
no attempt to apply for his extradition to Britain, maintaining that it
would do so only if Germany refused Singapore's request, Pollard said.
"There are leaks from the SFO's press office that they see no reason to
change their mind", he added.
The SFO is due to make a public statement on the matter this week.
