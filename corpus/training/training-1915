Norway to raise oil output as of July 1 
Norway, the world's third-largest oil exporter, is to raise its oil
production as of July 1, the Norwegian oil and and energy ministry said
Monday.
"As we said last December, we will end the cut (of production) on June
30. The situation will be evaluated mid-June but the plan is to end the
cut (at) the half year", ministry spokeswoman Sissel Edvardsen told
AFP.
Last December, Norway, which is not a member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, agreed with OPEC and other oil producers
such as Russia to an output cut in at attempt to shore up slumping
prices.
Norway agreed to bring its production down from 3.17 million barrels
per day to 3.02 million for the first half of this year.
It did not say to which level it planned to raise its output again.
