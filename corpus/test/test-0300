Zimbabwe Drafts Bill to Penalize Polluters 
Widespread pollution of the environment in Zimbabwe by companies may
come to an end as the government has drafted a bill which proposes
stiff penalties for offending firms, the daily Herald reported
Wednesday.
The draft Environment and Natural Resources Bill, now with the
Attorney- General's Office, proposes a maximum fine of 50,000
Zimbabwean dollars (1, 315 U.S. dollars) for first offenders or
imprisonment for one year or both for non-compliance with the
environment protection order.
On second or subsequent convictions, the offender will pay a maximum of
500,000 Zimbabwean dollars (13,157 U.S. dollars) or serve four years in
prison or both.
At present, fines are as low as 1,000 Zimbabwean dollars (26 U.S.
dollars) for first offenders and 2,000 Zimbabwean dollars (52 U.S.
dollars) for second offenders. As a result companies have been finding
it cheaper to pay the fines than to dispose of their waste at
designated places.
A number of companies in Harare, including some reputable firms, were
early this year convicted of dumping toxic waste at undesignated
places.
The proposed new fines and jail terms will also be applicable to any
person who obstructs or hinders an inspector searching premises for
hazardous substances, tampers with any samples or articles taken or
makes false statements in connection with any toxic wastes.
The Bill provides for sustainable management of the environment and
natural resources for public benefit and to consolidate laws relating
to the environment, which were previously administered under different
ministries.
The Bill is being discussed at the on-going national environment
conference in Harare, the capital.
Addressing delegates, Ministers of Mines, Environment and Tourism Simon
Moyo said Zimbabwe had experienced increasing environmental problems in
the last six years.
