A young couple stop for a drink in a wine bar.
``I'll have a glass of chardonnay,'' the woman says.
``Californian?'' asks the bartender. ``French?''
``French,'' they reply in unison.
``Macon blanc, Pouilly-Fuisse?''
``No,'' says the woman, ``we want chardonnay.''
The barman smiles. ``They are all made from chardonnay,'' he says.
The people who make and sell wine in this country have been at odds
over what to call their product for 50 years. For a time, it seemed as
if they had come to an amicable truce. The Europeans would stick to
geographic names -- Macon and Pouilly-Fuisse are real places -- and the
New World would go with varietals, calling wines, for instance,
chardonnay, cabernet and zinfandel to signify the grape variety from
which they are made.
Generally speaking, this rule still applies. Nevertheless, there are
more and more signs that the truce is shaky.
Just in the last five years, major wine producers in the South of
France have entered the market with extensive lines of varietal wines.
Wines from Fortant de France, Val d'Orbieu and Les Jamelles, to name
three labels, are sold as chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, syrah and
other grapes. (Though Chateau Lafite-Rothschild has given no indication
that it plans to call its wine cabernet sauvignon.)
Most of these wines come from the Midi, a vast vineyard area that
sweeps across southern France from Nice to the Spanish border. Not too
many years ago, the wines from this region bore local geographic names,
Cotes du Luberon, Corbieres, Minervois, Cotes de Provence, Bandol.
Much of this wine was mediocre, at least in part because it was made
from mediocre grapes. Prodded by the French government, the growers
began about 20 years ago to replant their vineyards with better
varieties like cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. And they resolved to
trumpet that fact by featuring the grape names on their bottles.
The American experience was different. It was based on on supplying
inexpensive wine to an immigrant population that had never concerned
itself with fine wines in Europe. To appeal to this audience, wine
makers used European generic names, burgundy, claret and riesling, for
wines that bore little resemblance to the genuine thing.
To distinguish fine wines from cheap blends, California wine makers
began to use the grape names. The change came gradually; at first a
wine could be called, say, chardonnay, so long as at least half of it
was chardonnay. In the 1970s, the minimum was raised to 75 percent.
With the American market in mind, other New World wine makers adopted
the American system. Thus we speak of Australian chardonnay, Chilean
cabernet sauvignon and South African pinot noir.
There are exceptions to these rules. One French wine regions, Alsace,
has always used varietal names.
In Germany, specific location names that include the town and the
vineyard, as in Bernkasteler Doctor, share almost equal billing with
the grape variety -- invariably riesling in the best wines.
Italy's best-known wines take geographic names, like Chianti, Orvieto,
Bardolino. But there are almost as many wines using grape names. Among
them barbera, barbaresco and trebbiano.
Some Italian wine names, like Dolcetto d'Alba and Brunello di
Montalcino, combine place and grape names.
Italy has major plantings of merlot, which can appear under its own
name or in blends. Cabernet sauvignon can turn up either by itself or
in blends with native varieties like sangiovese. These wines are
expensive and often have fanciful names like Ornellaia, Elegia and
Sammarco.
Spain and Portugal continue to rely almost exclusively on geographic
names: Rioja, Rueda, Valdepenas, Oporto. Even Sherry is an
Anglicization of the Spanish city Jerez. One exception: the well-known
Catalan wines of Torres, all of which bear brand names like Sangre de
Toro and Vina Sol. Like Champagne, Spain's big sparkling wine business
relies on brand names, the two largest being Codorniu and Freixenet.
Some traditionalists decry the trend toward varietal names. They say it
tends to overlook the importance of ``terroir,'' a French word that
encompasses the soil, the climate and the unique characteristics of a
specific vineyard site.
To the traditionalists, varietalism, as it is called, is an initial
step in the eventual homogenization of wine styles. Varietal names,
they warn, will lead consumers to expect the same taste from wines,
regardless of where they are made. Furthermore, they contend, the use
of varietal names destroys much of the romance we associate with wine.
And they do have a point. Gevrey-Chambertin, for example, conveys
images of the Burgundian countryside, of the legendary vineyards of the
Cote d'Or, of unspoiled country villages, of ruddy-faced farmers and
unforgettable food and wine.
Pinot noir, the grape from which all the wines of Gevrey-Chambertin are
made, conveys the image of, well, of a grape.
