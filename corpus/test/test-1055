Roundup: Africa to Strengthen Capacity Building for Sustainable Development 
African countries have determined to further strengthen capacity
building for sustainable development in the continent.
At the just-ended "Regional Workshop for National Focal Points on
Capacity-Building Coordination in Africa" held in Lusaka, participants
from 14 African countries noted that a country cannot hope to make much
progress toward sustainable development and poverty reduction unless it
has the requisite human and institutional capacity to effectively
design, implement and manage its development policies and programs.
There is consensus among African leaders, leading scholars, academics
and donors that capacity building is Africa's most urgent challenge and
the cornerstone of its development strategy.
National development capacity refers to a nation's collective capacity
to design and implement all of its development programs so as to uplift
the quality of life of its citizens. Capacity building entails both
human skills enhancement and institution strengthening.
According to a report presented to the workshop, the linkage between
capacity building and sustainable development has been amply
illustrated by the outstanding records of the fast growing Southeast
Asian countries.
In the early 1960s, several of these countries had the same per capita
incomes as some Africa countries but these countries are now much more
developed with per capita incomes 25 times those of African countries.
These countries lack natural resources and also faced discrimination
against their exports to the West. These countries invested heavily in
all levels of education and other social services. They also
determinedly shared the fruits of growth, thus reducing inequality.
Also, in the 1960s to 1970s, most African countries invested heavily in
all levels of education, health and physical infrastructure. Some
African universities were renowned the world over, as centers of
excellence in both teaching and research. Significant inroads were made
in building government's capacity to manage the nation's development.
However, by the 1980s, most governments were experiencing serious
economic crises and reduced their investments in education, health and
physical infrastructure. As the 21st century begins, Africa is lagging
behind of other regions in socio-economic development. Africa has many
of the world's poorest countries, with per capita income lower than
before independence. About 50 percent of Africa's people are classified
as poor and 30 percent as extremely poor, the report said.
Meanwhile, most African countries have inadequate or collapsing
infrastructure, environmental degradation, high unemployment, growing
maldistribution of available incomes, assets and services. Both the
universities and the civil service continue to suffer from massive
brain drain, estimated at 23,000 per year.
The situation is a result of both internal and external factors. These
factors have reduced the capacity of African countries to invest
sufficiently and sustainable in human and institutional capacity
building.
The capacity of many countries is being further eroded by armed
conflicts which according to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), claimed two million lives in the last five years. In
addition, there are massive flows of refugees and displaced persons
currently estimated at 12 million, over 40 percent of the world's
refugee population.
The HIV/AIDS pandemic that is decimating the population of some African
countries, threatens to reverse the gains made cross the spectrum of
socio-economic development. In the most affected countries, the disease
is taking upward of 25 percent of the budget.
Standing at the crossroad of renewal and transformation in this new
millennium, African countries are sharing a common awareness that
without the requisite capacity, countries cannot take advantage of
globalization and world technological advances, both of which require
educated work forces and new organizational and administrative systems.
Established in November 1991, the African Capacity Building Foundation
(ACBF)'s initial mandate was to play a leading role in the
strengthening of skills to formulate and implement macroeconomic
policies through research, training and institutional development.
The foundation's interventions over the past nine years have provided
African countries an opportunity to rethink their dependence on foreign
technical assistance, to set up investment and appropriately channel
external funding support into the building and sustenance of indigenous
capacity.
Currently, the Harare based independent, development funding
institution has a project portfolio comprising 32 projects, of which 12
are training projects and 20 are policy units spanning more than 23
African countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
At the end of December 1999, the 14-member foundation had awarded 42
grants, through the collaborative efforts of three multilateral
institutions including the African Development Bank, the World Bank and
the United Nations Development Program, to build capacity in policy
analysis and development management. The cumulative cost of projects
stood at 213.08 million U.S. dollars, out of which ACBF commitment was
86.52 million dollars.
At the institutional level, the foundation has spearheaded the
establishment from scratch of institutions entirely devoted to policy
analysis on a continent. These policy units have raised the
consciousness of policy-makers to the need to design and implement
policies based on information generated through sound research and
analysis.
As regards human capacity building, several policy units supported by
the foundation have undertaken multi-pronged in-service training
programs, whose impact on the increase in the number of qualified
policy analysts and development managers in their respective countries
is indisputable.
The training programs have enhanced post-graduate economics education
in several African countries. Some 33 department of economics in
universities across Africa have been strengthened, resulting in an
improvement in their teaching and research capacities.
On the other hand, programs targeting finance ministers, governors of
Central/Reserve Banks and Permanent Secretaries for finance have
strengthened commitment to policy reforms awareness of strategies of
the need to improve economic governance.
Last year, the ACBF approved the integration of the Partnership for
Capacity Building in Africa (PACT) into ACBF. This new framework will
enhance public sector performance and effectiveness, strengthen
public-private sector-civil society interface and strengthen the
capacity level of regional institutions.
And at its meeting on May 3-5, 2000, the ACBF approved 17 of the new
projects and support for 11 national focal points. A total funding
commitment of 24.29 million dollars was made in May 2000 under the
foundation's expanded mandate. The countries include Botswana, Chad,
Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Guinea,
Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Swaziland and Zambia. Each country will receive
a funding support of 50,000 dollars over a period of two years.
Speaking to journalists in a press conference shortly after the end of
the workshop, Soumana Sako, the executive secretary of the foundation,
stressed that Africa needs to assume the leadership and ownership of
the development process of their own countries. Donor assistance is
critical but African countries need to be in the driving seat.
