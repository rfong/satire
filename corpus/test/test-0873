Outrageous enough to send shivers up the gelatinous spine of your
average television executive, the BBC's ``Absolutely Fabulous'' is
having its American premiere this Sunday on Comedy Central, with a
12-episode marathon beginning at 3 p.m.
Be assured, this is one of the daffiest sitcoms to come out of Britain
since ``Fawlty Towers.'' The incurably prim and politically correct are
advised to stick with public television's cooking shows.
``Abfab,'' as the English call it, was created by Jennifer Saunders,
once of a British comedy series called ``French and Saunders.'' In
addition to writing all the scripts, Ms. Saunders plays Edina, a 40-ish
fashion press agent who clings whackily to the liberated 60s.
Her best friend since childhood, Patsy, played by Joanna Lumley, is a
fashion editor who has found job security by sleeping with her
publisher.
Somewhat squat Edina is almost buxom; tall Patsy (Ms. Lumley was once a
model) is all lanky angles, aggressively displayed in leather
miniskirts and black net stockings.
Edina and Patsy are inordinately fond of smoking, drinking, drugging
and high fashion. Patsy thinks of water as a mix, explaining that ``we
drink it with whiskey.''
They call everybody darling or sweetie. When not maniacally punching up
numbers on her cellular phone (``Enchanting as we speak. Bye-bye,
darling''), Edina retreats into Buddhist chants, colonic irrigations or
an isolation tank.
In a clever generational reversal, the stern voice of disapproval
belongs to Edina's 16-year-old daughter, Saffron (Julia Sawalha), who
has to listen to Mom, obviously coping with a raging hangover, deliver
idiotic lectures about ``health, health, health, darling.''
In one episode, an exasperated Edina screams at the scientifically
inclined Saffron: ``Why don't you just rebel, for God's sake?'' But
Patsy, not especially fond of Saffron, is always there to reassure
Edina: ``Darling, you are a fabulous, wonderful individual. Remember, I
know you longer than your daughter.''
Ms. Saunders and Ms. Lumley superbly pull off the tricky feat of being
hilariously horrid. Even as you wince, Edina and Patsy are somehow
endearing, zonked-out rebels in a world of dullards.
Best episode: Edina's 40th birthday (``The buzzards circling,
darling'').
She would prefer a traditional party with ``some celebrities and
Japanese finger food.'' But her daughter arranges a family affair,
including Edina's two former husbands, one with his male lover, the
other, a former drug addict, now in the mothering clutches of an
American amazon, played to a perfectly loony New Age pitch by Mo
Gaffney.
As Edina warns Saffron, ``We're hardly the bloody Waltons, are we?''
Hardly, indeed.

`REBEL HIGHWAY'
Showtime, Friday night at 10
This collection of 10 new films offering homage to 1950s drive-in
movies, the teen-angst kind churned out by American International
Pictures, provides an unusual showcase for name directors, including
William Friedkin (``The Exorcist''), Jonathan Kaplan (``The Accused''),
Uli Edel (``Last Exit to Brooklyn''), Ralph Bakshi (``Cool World'') and
John McNaughton (``Mad Dog and Glory'').
The weekly presentations, drenched in violence, get under way with
``Roadracers,'' written (with Tommy Nix), directed and edited by
25-year-old Robert Rodriguez (``El Mariachi'').
Getting his period touches down pat, Rodriguez cleverly stretches out
the thin tale of Dude (David Arquette), a sort of dim-witted rebel in a
nasty town that has a billboard reading: ``This is God's country.
Please don't drive through like hell.''
Dude has a Mexican-American girlfriend (Salma Hayek) and a nerdy
spaced-out best friend (John Hawkes), who has seen ``Invasion of the
Body Snatchers'' 15 times, the last time improbably sitting next to one
of its stars, Kevin McCarthy.
Dude also has a nemesis in a sadistic local cop named Sarge (William
Sadler), who is using his son Teddy (Jason Wiles) to stir up trouble.
Highlight: A confrontation between Dude and Teddy at a roller-skating
rink, the outcome hinging on hair grease.
From square parents to ominous rumbles, ``Roadracers'' doesn't miss a
cliche in the depiction of rebels without a cause. Skillfully done,
though.
