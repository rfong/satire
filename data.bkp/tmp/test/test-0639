Among/IN the/DT items/NNS added/VBN include/VB aircraft/NN wings/NNS ,/, effectively/RB banning/VBG the/DT commercial/JJ aircraft/NN intended/VBD to/TO ferry/VB passengers/NNS from/IN airport/NN terminals/NNS ./.

The/DT new/JJ security/NN directive/NN ,/, which/WDT goes/VBZ into/IN effect/NN on/IN Monday/NNP ,/, was/VBD issued/VBN by/IN TSA/NN headquarters/NNS ./.

Officials/NNS we/PRP contacted/VBD declined/VBD to/TO comment/VB ,/, instead/RB referring/VBG us/PRP to/TO TSA/NNP 's/POS public/JJ relations/NNS office/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT edges/NNS of/IN many/JJ aircraft/NN wings/NNS are/VBP what/WP we/PRP here/RB at/IN the/DT TSA/NN call/VBP sharp/JJ ,/, ''/'' said/VBD TSA/NNP spokesman/NN Mark/NNP Hatfield/NNP ,/, Jr./NNP ``/`` Because/IN we/PRP have/VBP identified/VBN sharp/JJ things/NNS as/IN being/VBG bad/JJ the/DT TSA/NN has/VBZ made/VBN a/DT decision/NN that/IN aircraft/NN wings/NNS will/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB allowed/VBN at/IN airport/NN terminals/NNS ./.

``/`` Banning/VBG aircraft/NN with/IN wings/NNS is/VBZ like/IN banning/VBG cars/NNS with/IN tires/NNS ./.

I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN the/DT rule/NN against/IN flushing/NN toilets/VBZ while/IN parked/VBN at/IN the/DT terminal/NN was/VBD stupid/JJ but/CC this/DT takes/VBZ the/DT cake/NN ./. ''/''
