(25) Air Echelon Flying Over Tiananmen Square 
While the audience is still applauding the rumbling tanks that slowly
roar past the Tiananmen Square, an air echelon consisting of a bomber
and eight fighters is arriving overhead, signalling the beginning for
the air flyover.
The echelon is flying low in a triangle formation, with smoke tailing
the aircraft.
All eight fighter planes belong to the "August 1st" Flying Performing
Team. Reputed as the "airborne honor guard", the team has received 182
delegations from 92 countries and regions, performed flying show for
243 times with the rate of success standing at a hundred percent. The
team made its debut during the military review at the 35th anniversary
of the People's Republic of China. Enidtem nnnn
