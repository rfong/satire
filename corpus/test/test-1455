World Swimming Championships Highlights 
The 9th world swimming championships slated for July 16-29 in the
southern Japanese city Fukuoka shall be unique with eye-catching
features.
This is the first time since the inaugural world swimming championships
in 1973 that the event is to be held in Asia. European countries had
hosted the event for four times -- in 1973 in Belgrade, in 1978 in
Berlin, in 1986 in Madrid and most lately, in 1984 in Rome. Oceania has
hosted the event twice and in the same city -- in 1991 and 1998, both
in Perth, western Australia. South America had been the hosts twice --
in 1975 in Cali and in 1982 in Guayaquil.
This year's event also features a further expansion of competition
program, with the addition of men's and women's 50 meters swimming
events for backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and men's 800m
freestyle and women's 1,500m freestyle as well as 10 kilometers men's
and women's open water swimming, which is also known as long distance
swimming, in seas, rivers or lakes.
A temporary Olympic-size (50 meters) swimming pool has been created,
for the first time in the world, in the coastal venue of Marine Messe,
a multi-purpose convention and exhibition facility, for swimming and
synchronized swimming events.
The championships emblem is a combination of three colored circles,
representing citizens and swimming by a blue circle, swimmers and
spectators by a yellow-green circle and Fukuoka and the world by a navy
blue one. All these rings form a larger circle of harmony, which
signals the event's aim of contributing to the world peace by promoting
friendship and active exchanges.
The Mascot named Pachapo is in association with many folklores
originated in Kyushu Island, especially around Fukuoka. It was designed
based on the image of Kappa, an imaginary creature living by the
waterside, linking it with the image f swimming. Smiling from ear to
ear, "it will warmly welcome swimmers and officials from all over the
world with its comical expression," a championships booklet said.
The championships will be televised in some 100 other countries and
regions worldwide, according to the organizers.
