Vietnam to export cane bicycles to the Netherlands 
Vietnam is to export cane-covered bicycles to the Netherlands, a
spokesman for the manufacturer said Monday.
The company, Lixeha, will send 115 sports models, having already
exported 120 of the machines to Bulgaria, the spokesman added.
The bike, which costs from 90 to 125 dollars, has been described by the
Vietnam News Agency as both "a means of transport and a unique piece of
art."
