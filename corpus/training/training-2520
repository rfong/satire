China Provides Mobile Banking Services 
China's largest mobile network operator China Mobile recently began
offering mobile banking services throughout 17 provinces and
municipalities.
Collaborating initially with three leading banks -- the Bank of China,
the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank,
China Mobile will provide these services to some half million
subscribers in the initial phase.
Users will be able to access their banks via mobile phone for
transactions such as checking bank balances, paying phone bills, and
transferring funds between accounts. Several million subscribers are
expected to benefit from the service by the end of this year.
Other banks are now talking with the company to cooperate in this
service, according to a China Mobile official.
China Mobile is also planning a range of other new services for the
future, including a stock-trading application which is scheduled to be
unveiled in the coming months.
Using java-compatible Simera SIM cards provided by Schlumberger
Limited, which are capable of being upgraded as needed, China Mobile
will easily be able to extend its service range, said the company
official.
