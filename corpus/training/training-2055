HK Bank to Issue Floating-Rate Certificates of Deposit 
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HongkongBank)
announced here today that it will issue one billion HK dollars (128
million US dollars) in three-year floating-rate certificates of deposit
(FRCDs).
The subscription period will close on or before May 1, 1995, said a
spokesman for the bank.
The FRCDs, priced at a rate of one-month HIBOR (interbank overnight
rate) plus 25 basis points, are being issued under HongkongBank's eight
billion HK dollars (1.02 billion US dollars) CD program, which was
established in November 1994, the spokesman said.
The proceeds of the issue will be used for the general development and
expansion of the HongkongBank Group's business, he said.
The issue is being managed and underwritten by Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation (HSBC) Markets, said he, adding that application is
being made to Moody's Investors Services to obtain a rating for the
issue and to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to enable the FRCDs to be
used as collateral in dealings with the Liquidity Adjustment Facility.
HongkongBank is a principal member of the HSBC Group which is among the
world's largest financial services organizations. HongkongBank and its
subsidiaries have some 600 offices in 28 countries.
