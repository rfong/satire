Philippine military runs the kidnapping industry: anti-crime watchdog 
A citizen's watchdog group charged Wednesday that senior military and
police officials now run crime gangs which have turned kidnapping into
a million-dollar industry and driven small Filipino-Chinese businessmen
into bankruptcy.
Rogue "police and military officers took over the crime syndicates"
during the dictatorial rule of late former president Ferdinand Marcos,
Citizens Action Against Crime spokeswoman Tess Baltazar told reporters
here.
By the time former general Fidel Ramos was elected president in 1992,
the major people involved in such crimes were "coming from this
institution," she added.
An official of the monitor, Teresita See, named several active-duty
military and police colonels and at least one general, including some
who had been appointed to anti-kidnapping task forces, as among the
masterminds.
Only one, Colonel Reynaldo Berroya who is now serving a life term, has
been convicted, while several others have been acquitted. Others were
never prosecuted, See said.
The group said nearly a thousand victims have been snatched by these
gangs between 1993 and April 17 this year. Of these, 76 were killed in
captivity.
Freed victims have recounted how, as they were held blindfold in
safehouses, their captors had "walked in measured steps" in the manner
of soldiers, and how the gang leaders were addressed as "sir" as the
guards clicked their heels and went into a posture of attention.
See said some of the victims actually heard "flag-raising ceremonies"
going on nearby, while in at least two cases, the family of the victim
was instructed to drop the ransom package inside the chapel of Manila's
main military camp and another was ordered to put it in a trash bin
near the camp's flagpole.
The families of 241 victims put up 200 million pesos (7.6 million
dollars) last year, while kidnap gangs collected 142.3 million pesos
(5.4 million dollars) from the kin of only 83 victims in just 107 days
so far this year, See said.
She said the group was set up in 1993 to lobby the Ramos government
into taking more decisive action, and had at first thought that "we
would soon become irrelevant."
However, "instead of improving the kidnapping problem has only gotten
worse."
The Ramos government concedes that some rogue military and police
officers and men are involved with the kidnap gangs, but officials say
they are undertaking a renewed campaign to cleanse the ranks.
The Ramos cabinet last month described an article in the influential US
magazine Fortune -- which called the Philippines the "kidnap capital of
Asia" -- as exaggerated.
See said that on average, about 40 percent of the victims are of
Chinese-Filipino stock. The minority group are prominent in business
and tend to eschew politics.
And while most of the victims during the 1980s were the scions of the
wealthy families, many of the victims these days are small businessmen,
including owners of family-run sweatshops.
"Victims have had to go deep into debt and put their entire business in
hock just to raise ransom," See said. She said she personally knew of
four families who were driven out of business for acceding to ransom
demands.
She charged that the police and military used radical Moslem guerrilla
groups in the southern Philippines as "convenient" scapegoats for
abductions which some in the government ranks actually commit.
The group still advised the families of kidnap victims to report the
cases to certain police officers who the group believed are
professional and not in league with the gangs.
She spoke of how the family members would be so distraught as to "go
without sleep for a week" in the process of negotiating with the
abductors, while some are driven "close to the point of suicide."
See said the citizen's group has advised the families of some of the
victims, teaching them "how to negotiate" and urging them to "calm
down."
The families are told that "paying big would be making it too easy" for
the kidnappers, and that the gangs "need the money, not the victim."
The group's spokeswoman, Baltazar, described the judicial system as too
"inefficient, ineffective and corrupt" to make any impact on the
criminal gangs.
See said the group was unaware if the proceeds from the criminal
activity was being laundered into legal businesses, but urged the
justice department to conduct a study on the lifestyles of police and
military officials.
