S. Africa Could Lower Rates Again: Central Banker 
There was a possibility that the bank rate could be reduced again
before the budget in March next year, South African Press Association
quoted Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals as saying today.
Recent market developments would help curb bank credit extension,
making it easier to bring interest rate down, Stals told journalists.
He said he was happy with the current exchange rate of the Rand as
compared with the basket of other currencies. He did not have a view on
the Rand's performance against the U.S. dollar, which he said was
fluctuating against other currencies.
Last month, Reserve Bank lowered its lending rate to commercial banks
by one percentage point to 16 percent.
