India needs to produce more grain
India must more than double its grain output to some 400 million tonnes
a year over the next 50 years, to meet the needs of its spiralling
population, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha said Monday.
Rao told a meeting of agriculture experts that existing methods of
cultivation were inadequate and new methods were needed to boost
foodgrain production, which totalled nearly 180 million tonnes in the
last fiscal year.
The prime minister said India's population of nearly 900 million was
expected to double in the next 50 years, and "our agricultural growth
is just keeping pace with the population growth."
India is largely self-sufficient in food, but grain output of 179.10
million in fiscal 1993-94 was below the projected 188 million tonnes.
Barely 30 percent of India's agricultural land is irrigated and the
rest rain-fed. Crop failures are frequent due to poor rainfall.
Agriculture provides a livelihood for 70 percent of the country's
population.
