Chan arrives for Hong Kong confidence-building 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's lieutenant, Chief Secretary Anson
Chan, arrived here Thursday for a three-day visit to France aimed at
reassuring investors about Hong Kong's future under Chinese rule after
1997.
Chan, the first ethnic Chinese and the first woman to serve as the
colony's chief secretary in more than 150 years of British rule, was
guest at a dinner Thursday night given by Development Aid Minister
Jacques Godfrain, standing in for Foreign Minister Herve de Charette.
Chan arrived here after paying a similar confidence-building visit to
Italy.
On Thursday she and French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis were set to
sign an agreement for the protection and promotion of French
investments in Hong Kong extending past 1997.
She signed a similar accord in Italy.
Chan was also to lunch with Senate president Rene Monory and meet
National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin, as well as foreign trade
junior minister Yves Galland and Jean-David Levitte, President Jacques
Chirac's foreign affairs advisor.
She was to address the French Institute of International Relations
(IFRI) on the situation in Hong Kong before dining with British
ambassador to France Christopher Mallaby on Thursday evening.
On Friday, she was to address 200 businessman and journalists at a
lunch organised by France's chamber of commerce and industry and the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
Under the 1984 Sino-British treaty returning Britain's last major
overseas colony to communist Chinese sovereignty, Hong Kong is to
remain autonomous and capitalist for at least 50 years after the
handover.
But to shore up overseas confidence in Hong Kong's future, Patten's
administration has been negotiating "investment promotion and
protection agreements" with foreign governments which also safeguard
Hong Kong investments abroad.
Chan, a Shanghai-born mother of two, is seen by many in Hong Kong as a
potential successor to Patten after 1997.
While the governor remains persona non grata with Beijing for his
democratic political reforms, Chan has been able to have direct
contacts with Chinese officials, including a meeting earlier this year
with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
