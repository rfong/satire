State government seizes control of 2000 Olympics
The New South Wales state government has seized control of the 2000
Sydney Olympics as it seeks to avoid the problems which marred the
private-enterprise Atlanta Games.
Michael Knight, the tough 43-year-old state Olypmics minister, was
named president of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic
Games (SOCOG), replacing John Iliffe, chairman of the Woolworths Ltd
retailing giant.
SOCOG will organise the Games themselves leaving construction of
facilities mainly to the state government or as Knight has put it,"the
government is building the theatre, SOCOG is putting on the show."
But Iliffe's shock resignation on Friday makes Knight the supremo for
the great sports festival for the turn of the century.
The state government's move follows concern in the Olympic movement
about logistic and other organisational problems at Atlanta where
private enterprise had a key role.
Iliffe said in a statement that after studying reports of the Atlanta
Games and watching operations there at first hand, he felt there had to
be "the closest possible relationship between the organising committee,
the government of the day and the Olympics movement generally."
"There was a lack of closeness between private enterprise and the
government at Atlanta and ... difficulties flowed from that," Knight
said in a weekend radio interview.
He maintained that the new mix of government and private enterprise was
"exactly the blend they had in Barcelona and exactly the blend" sought
by Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic
Committee.
"I absolutely support this move ... whenever there has been a strong
government involvement and commitment to the Games as in Barcelona and
Albertville, the experience has been very, very positive and and
beneficial," Samaranch was quoted here by newspapers as saying.
Iliffe was the second SOCOG president to quit in six months and his
resignation came only four days after Telstra executive Gerry Moriarty
pulled out at the last minute from his appointment as SOCOG's chief
operating officer.
The 15-member SOCOG board has been described by Australian commentators
as faction-ridden, and Knight admitted there was a "little bit of
fractiousness" and that he would be seeking to get the board "pulling
together."
On Monday, bulldozers will start work on the site of the Olympic
Stadium at Homebush, a formerly neglected area on the Paramatta River,
16 kilometres (10 miles) west of the city's highrise center.
One of Knight's biggest tasks will be finishing facilities on time with
construction requiring around 10,000 workers.
Holland Construction, a major contractor, has agreed to pay workers
increases of 100 Australian dollars (79 US) a week in a productivity
deal, it was disclosed Sunday.
Federal Industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith labelled the 15
percent wage increase as "blackmail" and said it threatened to bust the
Games budget.
"Its a very sensible deal," Knight riposted, denying press reports that
the deal included a no-strike clause.
He said the pay rise guaranteed that the Olympic facilities -- set to
cost hundreds of millions of dollars -- would be "produced on time and
on budget."
