Latin Patriarch Calls for Inclusive Jerusalem Settlement 
Any Jerusalem settlement must take into account the religious rights of
Christian, Muslims and Jews and political claims of Palestinians and
Israelis or sow the seeds of a future war, the top Roman Catholic
clergyman in the Holy Land said Thursday.
``Any special status should satisfy all of these five elements,'' Latin
Patriarch Michel Sabbah told reporters.
``Everyone should be in Jerusalem with equal rights. Any element ...
left outside Jerusalem _ that means a seed for future war and
dissension,'' said Sabbah, a Palestinian.
Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue dividing Israelis and
Palestinians.
Israel says it will never relinquish control over all of the city,
including the eastern part it captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as a future capital.
The walled Old City in east Jerusalem houses sacred shrines, including
Judaism's Western Wall, Islam's Al Aqsa Mosque and Christianity's
Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
The final status of the city is to be worked out in negotiations that
are supposed to begin by next year.
An agreement on the city's special status should be backed by an
international guarantee, Sabah said, adding that he was not suggesting
international control of Jerusalem.
The special status should be worked out and implemented by Israeli and
Palestinian authorities, he said. hh-hla-kl
