Netanyahu to hold press conference 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a press conference for
Friday afternoon to make his first public statement about the
unprecedented Israeli-Palestinian fighting in the occupied territories,
his spokesman said.
Army chief of staff General Amnon Shahak and other security officials
will also attend the press conference, scheduled for 1300 GMT, the
spokesman said.
The press conference follows an emergency meeting of Netanyahu's
cabinet overnight which issued a stern warning to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to halt shooting by Palestinian police against Israeli
soldiers.
Two days of clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police and
civilians Wednesday and Thursday left 53 Palestinians and 11 Israeli
soldiers killed, the deadliest incidents in the territories since they
were occupied by Israel in 1967.
"The shooting at the Israeli security forces by Palestinian police and
the incitement to violence constitutes a serious violation of the
agreements," Netanyahu's government said in its statement overnight.
"The continuation of such actions threatens seriously to endanger the
peace process," it said.
Palestinian officials said Netanyahu telephoned Arafat earlier Friday,
but no details of their conversation were revealed.
