Figure in FBI files controversy refuses to testify 
A key figure in the growing "Filegate" controversy over FBI files
refused to testify before the Senate Friday, invoking his
constitutional right against self-incrimination.
Anthony Marceca, who was an aide in the White House's Office of
Personnel Security, "will assert his right to remain silent under the
Fifth Amendment in response to any question he may be asked by the
committee," Senator Orrin Hatch announced at the beginning of a Senate
Judiciary Committee hearing on the matter.
Earlier this week Marceca testified before a House of Representatives
committee investigating the growing scandal over how and why he
obtained more than 700 confidential FBI files, many of them of
prominent Republicans.
"We reserve the right to consider whether (Marceca's) invocation of the
Fifth Amendment is well-founded," Hatch told the committee.
Marceca's lawyers this week revealed that the obtained files included
those of former National Security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former
Central Intelligence Agency chief Robert Gates.
The administration of President Bill Clinton has blamed the affair on a
"bureaucratic snafu" resulting from an outdated Secret Service list
that included former officials in the administrations of President
George Bush and Ronald Reagan.
The security office was charged with updating clearances for people
entitled to enter the White House. The Republicans no longer needed
White House entry, but Clinton officials obtained their FBI files
anyway.
Such files often include unverified allegations of a personal nature
which are gathered by FBI officials who interview friends and neighbors
of people needing security clearances.
Former personnel security chief Craig Livingstone, who supervised
Marceca, on Wednesday announced his immediate resignation, saying he
failed to properly oversee Marceca's activities.
