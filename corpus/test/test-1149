Area Man Likes To Compare Circle Of Friends To Cast Of Lost
Though Krewalski does not have any black friends, he would want them to
be like Mr. Eko rather than Michael.
After re-watching the last six episodes of the show's first season Tuesday
night, local resident Sam Krewalski, a 29-year-old data-entry clerk and
avid Lost fan, mentioned yet again that the diverse cast of characters
featured in the hit ABC drama "totally reminds [him]" of his circle of
eight friends.
"Dave [Engler] is definitely Jack," said Krewalski, comparing the
31-year-old line cook whom he has known since college to the selfless
doctor and leader of the survivors. "Always has a plan. Always making
the tough decisions. Just last week, none of us could decide where we
wanted to eat, when Dave all of a sudden steps in and says Outback
Steakhouse, and boom, it was like the scene where they all follow Jack
to the caves."
