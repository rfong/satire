US woman kidnapped in Guatemala 
A 64-year-old US citizen was kidnapped last week from her family's
ranch just east of the Guatemalan capital, according to police here.
A group of heavily armed men abducted Janice Morgan from her car late
Thursday near the town of Villa Canales, police said Friday. She was
hustled away in the back of a covered pickup.
Her family was sent a ransom note but no amount was specified.
Jaime Centeno, the son of a Salvadoran deputy, was killed in the same
area in late April. And on Wednesday, Yuri Truchkin, a second
undersecretary at the Russian embassy in Managua, was seriously wounded
in a drive-by shooting outside Guatemala's capital.
