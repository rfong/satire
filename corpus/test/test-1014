Bianchi set to take Fiorentina post (reports) 
Fiorentina are set to appoint former Ottavio Bianchi as their new
coach, the Italian media reported on Sunday.
Bianchi, already at the club as director of football, was with the club
in Verona ahead of their match with Chievo on Sunday with reports
saying that the club's owner and president Vittorio Cecchi Gori was set
to name him as the replacement for Roberto Mancini who resigned on
Friday.
"I am ready to give a hand to help Fiorentina," said Bianchi while
Cecchi Gori's lawyer Antonio Conte said that the club was preparing an
internal solution to the problem.
Conte indicated that film mogul Cecchi Gori might confirm the
appointment on RAI TV's Sunday evening football programme.
Bianchi, 58, has had notable success as a coach and counts Napoli, AS
Roma and Inter Milan among his former clubs and he led a Diego
Maradona-inspired Napoli to their first of two Italian titles in
1986-7.
Luciano Chiarugi has been in temporary control of the team since
Mancini quit and will look after the team for the Chievo match.
