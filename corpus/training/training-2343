European parliament names watchdog committee on madcow disease 
The European parliament named Thursday a watchdog committee to ensure
that European Union commissioners implement the assembly's
recommendations on tackling mad cow disease.
On February 19 the European parliament gave the commission nine months
to put its house in order, after accusing it of sacrificing public
health to the interests of the beef market.
The EU bureaucracy was slammed for its failure to combat the spread of
bovine spongiform encephelopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, a brain
disorder in cattle which it is now feared can spread to humans through
infected beef products.
But the parliament suspended a vote of censure, preferring to approve a
series of recommendations by a committee that had investigated the
commission policy on BSE.
The recommendations, to be implemented by November, included
legislative and administrative reforms, as well as disciplinary
measures.
The 20-member committee set up Thursday is to submit a report on the
commission's future actions by the beginning of December.
