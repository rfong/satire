But defying predictions his regime would collapse along with the former
socialist bloc, Castro has managed to keep his government afloat, ordering
a limited market-oriented economic opening, hold the political pluralism.
Since 1993, his government has legalized the holding of foreign
currencies, including the US dollar. It also has allowed
market-oriented economic reforms including farmers markets operating on
the laws of supply and demand, and limited categories of
self-employment.
Castro's government has called on Cubans to strengthen their resolve in
the face of the 34-year US economic embargo, formally tightened in
March.
From Cape Town, South African President Nelson Mandela sent birthday
greetings to Castro, a statement from Mandela's office said.
In his message, Mandela said that for the South African government and
for himself personally, the occasion was a reminder of the "selfless"
efforts of the Cuban people under Castro's leadership in support of the
liberation of South Africa in particular, and southern Africa in
general.
"Please be assured that you are in our thoughts as you celebrate this
important milestone in your life," Mandela told Castro.
