Mandela blames organisers for lack of support for Soweto Day 
President Nelson Mandela Thursday blamed youth organisers for the low
turnout at rallies to mark the 1976 Soweto riots that marked a turning
point in the struggle against apartheid.
In stark contrast to previous Soweto Day rallies, only about 4,000
people gathered in Johannesburg's main black township Soweto to hear
Mandela call on youth to become involved in the country's "exciting
transformation."
A music festival at FNB stadium on the outskirts of Soweto drew even
less support, with only around 1,000 people turning up for the day's
highlight, the U.S. rap group Arrested Development.
Questioned later at a press conference here, Mandela denied that the
commemoration had been dampened by democratic change in South Africa,
saying instead that the youth groups which organised the events had
lacked experience.
"Their capacity to organise left much to be desired," Mandela said, but
added that those who did turn up at the main rally, at Orlando stadium
in Soweto, had been "enthusiastic and high-spirited."
The stadium is a short distance from the memorial to Hector Pietersen,
the first victim of the June 16, 1976, massacre of black schoolchildren
by police.
The government decided not to declare June 16 a public holiday despite
criticism from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the
country's largest labour federation and an ally of Mandela's ruling
African National Congress (ANC).
Mandela told the Orlando rally that the government was reviewing all
public holidays to make them "reflective of the total experience of all
the people."
In another sign of changing times, Mandela was accompanied to the rally
by Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha, the former foreign
minister of ex-president and now Deputy President Frederik de Klerk.
De Klerk turned down an invitation to attend the rally, citing a
previous engagement.
Mandela announced the creation of a government committee on youth to
ensure that "young people are fully integrated into the social,
economic and political life of society."
He said the government was pressing ahead with plans to introduce 10
years of free education for all and that he was "encouraged by reports
of a return to normality in the schools since the elections" in April,
the country's first all-race poll.
The introduction of Afrikaans -- the language favoured by the former
white-minority government -- as the medium of instruction in black
schools had led thousands of Soweto schoolchildren to confront the
police 18 years ago.
Police opened fire on a protest march and violence soon spread
throughout the sprawling township outside Johannesburg, leaving 65
people dead -- 62 of them shot by police -- by the end of the day.
Rioting quickly spread to the rest of the country and in five months of
widespread unrest at least 575 people were killed, according to the
findings of a commission named by then-prime minister John Vorster.
The Soweto uprising provided impetus to the ANC's struggle in exile,
sending the movement a wave of new recruits and focusing international
attention on South Africa.
Black leaders trace the demise of apartheid to June 16, saying it
ushered in the era of mass protests that led to the imposition of
international economic sanctions.
