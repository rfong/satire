Kunming Prepares For World Garden Expo 
Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, is in the midst
of an extensive construction program as part of preparations to host
the '99 World Garden Expo.
The exposition, which will run from May-October, is expected to attract
eight to 10 million people and 30 international organizations from 60
countries and regions.
The ongoing airport expansion project will raise its annual handling
capacity from two million to seven million passengers.
Kunming, a city known for mild temperatures in all four seasons, is
also building hotels to increase its daily accomodation capacity from
20,000 to 50,000 people.
The extensive campaign also includes road construction and cleaning
nearby Dianchi lake, one of China's major freshwater lakes.
