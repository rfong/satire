World Foreign Direct Investment Inflows Hit Record High in 2000 
World Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI) inflows increased by 18 percent
in 2000 to a record 1.3 trillion U.S. dollars, according to the figures
released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) here Thursday.
The figures showed that FDI flows have risen continuously since 1991,
the longest period of uninterrupted growth in 30 years.
UNCTAD experts said that among the three groups of economies --
developed countries, developing countries and Central and Eastern
Europe, the developed countries experienced the highest growth of FDI
inflows last year.
FDI inflows in developed countries increased by 21 percent, reaching 1
trillion dollars. Experts held that the rise was again fueled by
cross-border mergers and acquisitions.
Record levels were also set for inflows into developing countries and
Central and Eastern Europe, which were up by about 8 percent to 240
billion dollars and by 9 percent to 25 billion dollars respectively.
However, experts said the developing countries' and Central and Eastern
Europe's share in world FDI inflows continued to slide down. The share
of the developing world was the lowest in a decade.
They said that although the stagnation of FDI flows to developing
countries in 1997-1998 is over, the growth of these flows last year was
only led by Asia, particularly Hong Kong, China. Flows to Africa and
Latin America and the Caribbean actually declined.
The general slump in developing countries was felt most sharply in the
latter region, where flows were down 22 percent to 86 billion dollars.
