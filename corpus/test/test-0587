Shevardnadze in Britain Seeking Investment 
Leaving his troubled republic on a rare visit to the West, Georgian
leader Eduard Shevardnadze on Wednesday began a two-day visit to
Britain to try to win business investment.
Shevardnadze is to meet Prime Minister John Major, Queen Elizabeth II
and business and finance leaders.
With the former Soviet republic shattered by four civil and ethnic
conflicts since independence in 1991, Shevardnadze has come to seek
economic assistance to rebuild his country.
Britain's interest in Georgia is oil.
British Petroleum, with Statoil of Norway, heads a multinational
consortium to develop the rich offshore oil reserves of Georgia's
neighbor, Azerbaijan. The pipeline route to Western markets is the
subject of an intense diplomatic battle.
A leading set of plans has it going through Georgia to the Turkish port
of Ceyhan. But Russia, anxious to retain a grip on the oil wealth of
former Soviet republics, is pushing its own pipeline route to its Black
Sea port of Novorossysk.
