European troika to set up two joint military forces 
France, Italy and Spain are about to announce the creation of two joint
military forces which will be put at the disposal of the Western
European Union (WEU), diplomatic sources said Monday.
The official announcement of the new formations, one terrestrial, the
other naval, will precede the six-monthly ministerial meeting of the
WEU which is set to take place next Monday in Lisbon, a diplomat said.
The plan for the two forces - to be called "Euroforce" and "Euromarfor"
respectively - has been devised over several years.
Euroforce will have its military headquarters in Florence, Italy, but
will not have troops stationed there permanently. In times of crisis,
units from the three nations will be put under its control to form a
rapid intervention force.
Euromarfor will have no military headquarters but will aim to
coordinate more efficiently French, Italian and Spanish aeronaval
forces by planning the rapid installation of a joint command on board
an aircraft carrier in emergency situations.
