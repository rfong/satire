Troubled Nuclear Power Plant Back On Line 
Bulgaria's troubled Kozlodui nuclear power station resumed normal
operations Friday after an electrical malfunction that forced its
closure was repaired.
Five of the plant's six reactor units had to be shut down early
Thursday after an electrical switch malfunctioned, cutting power to the
units' water cooling systems. One reactor unit was already down for
maintenance.
The shutdown of Bulgaria's only nuclear plant caused power outages
throughout the country for 11 hours on Thursday.
But Yanko Yanev, chairman of the government Committee for Peaceful Uses
of Atomic Energy, said there was no risk of a radiation leak.
Experts from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences also reported Friday no
change in the radiation level over the last 24 hours.
It was the first complete shutdown of the troubled nuclear plant in its
20-year history although repeated malfunctions have forced technicians
to shut down reactors and curtail electricity supplies. The plant
normally generates 40 percent of Bulgaria's power needs.
A team of experts from the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy
Agency ended a two-week inspection of the Kozlodui plant on Friday. The
team was inspecting the safety of the two Soviet-design, 1,000 megawatt
reactors at the plant.
Team leader Raimond Russel told reporters Friday that six of 12
documented safety problems at the two reactors had been resolved, and
``good solutions'' were being implemented for the rest.
The Kozlodui nuclear plant, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Sofia,
is comprised of four 440-megawatt pressurized water reactors and the
two 1,000-megawatt reactors.
Bulgaria, burdened by a post-Communist foreign debt of dlrs 12.9
million, is seeking international aid to improve nuclear safety.
``This malfunction once again showed the importance of the only nuclear
plant for our country,'' Yanev said on Thursday.
