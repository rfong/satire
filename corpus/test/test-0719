Police arrest Moslem Brotherhood candidate 
A member of the Moslem Brotherhood was arrested and briefly detained on
Friday as he campaigned for Egypt's legislative elections, police said.
Mohammad Abdel Kuddus, a member of the journalists' union, was arrested
along with a student and a lawyer. All three were later released,
police said. They were accused of "organizing a demonstration and
chanting slogans hostile to the state," police said.
Several hundred people took part in the march in central Cairo in
support of Abdel Kuddus after Friday prayers, witnesses said.
Police said he would be interrogated by the state prosecutor on
Saturday.
The Brotherhood was banned in 1954 but has been tolerated since 1976
when it officially rejected violence. However, a government crackdown
since September has led to 81 members standing trial in military
courts.
The organization has fielded 150 candidates for the November 29
elections and accuses the government of trying to scupper its campaign.
