President claims victory in Albania poll 
President Sali Berisha announced late on Sunday that his Democratic
Party had won legislative elections which the opposition led by the
former communists claimed had been marred by fraud and intimidation.
"We have won," Berisha announced to an enthusiastic crowd of more than
6,000 supporters. Fireworks lit up the sky as the crowd chanted
"victory, victory" and the party elite supped champagne.
Cars draped with the DP flag drove round the city honking their horns.
Police cars sounded their sirens and one or two celebratory shots were
fired.
"This is an historic day. The Albanians have finally driven out the
communists," Berisha told AFP after the DP's main rivals the
ex-communist Socialist Party (SP) and six other opposition parties
pulled out of the vote to protest alleged irregularities.
"I consider their departure as an admission of defeat. A well deserved
defeat," the president said, adding: "The parties of the red front
should have given up four years ago."
The atmosphere was meanwhile subdued at the headquarters of the SP
where around 100 of its supporters gathered earlier chanting
"Berisha-Pinochet" - an allusion to the former hardline rightist ruler
of Chile.
The Socialists and four allied parties announced three hours before
polling closed that they were withdrawing from the election because of
alleged fraud and intimidation against their candidates.
They demanded that the election be annulled and a new one be held in
its place "in democratic conditions".
Two other small opposition parties followed suit, including the Human
Rights Party which represents the Greek minority.
Some of the 400 international observers on hand Sunday expressed
reservations about how the election was conducted.
European Parliament member, Jean-Francois Vallin of the French
Socialist Party, said he and 12 other foreign observers had witnessed
several irregularities in the northern district of Malesia.
"On the basis of what I and my colleagues saw, we can say that these
elections were not genuinely fair and in France for much less than
that, a judge would rule the outcome invalid," Vallin said.
Observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) declined to comment on the election until Monday.
Up to 80 percent of the 2.2 million electorate turned out to vote in
the elections which were the third since the collapse in 1990 of
Europe's last stalinist regime.
In a statement, the Socialists and four allied parties accused
Berisha's government of creating "a climate of terror, psychological
pressure and physical violence" before and on election day.
They said hundreds of Socialist Party members and supporters had been
"mistreated, harassed, threatened and detained." Two were wounded by
gunfire Sunday in the southern town of Vlora, party officials said.
In other irregularities, opposition representatives were prevented from
taking their seats on election monitoring panels. And ballot boxes were
sealed with no opposition members present, Socialist spokesman Kastriot
Islami said.
"We will not recognize the results of this election even if the
Socialist Party ends up winning," he said.
After polls closed, the electoral commission put turnout at 80 percent.
It had ordered officials at the 4,700 polling stations to stay on the
job despite the opposition withdrawal.
It said early results would be released overnight but no result had
been published by 01:00 Monday (2300 GMT).
Before the voting ended at 2000 GMT, the Democrats brandished an exit
poll crediting them with 59 percent of the vote.
Final results were not expected until late Monday.
After a campaign also marked by charges of violence and intimidation,
the election came down to a straight fight between Berisha's Democrats
and the Socialists.
They campaigned on similar themes, with both pledging to pursue market
reforms, create jobs, consolidate private property and bring Albania
into the European Union.
The voting was marred by several incidents. In Tropoja in northwest
Albania, a ruling party official chairing a local commission
supervising the vote was attacked with a knife, the electoral
commission said.
A Socialist Party official was found with 700 fake copies of electoral
registers in Vlora, in the south, prompting Berisha to delay the
closing time for polling stations by two hours to allow new copies of
registers to be distributed.
The election was for 140 parliamentary seats, 25 of which are allocated
on a proportional basis.
