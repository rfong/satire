Mubarak Sees `New Afghanistan' Without Aid to Palestinians 
President Hosni Mubarak predicted Wednesday that Gaza and the West Bank
could turn into ``a new, tougher Afghanistan'' unless international aid
quickly reaches the autonomous Palestinian territories.
In an interview with The Associated Press and Associated Press
Television, Mubarak also said the violence could spread to Europe if
the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank ``don't start feeling
the results of peace.''
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The AP on Tuesday that only about
6 percent of the dlrs 690 million promised by donors for the year
starting in May had been received.
Mubarak said the dlrs 2.2 billion in aid pledged overall to the
Palestinians is ``nonsense when you compare it with the money spent''
in the Middle East in nearly 50 years of warfare.
In other comments Mubarak said it is not yet time to lift U.N.
sanctions on Iraq and that most Arab leaders do not trust Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
He expressed hope that peace between Israel and Syria will be reached
by June, and said so-called Islamic fundamentalists ``have no idea
about'' Islam and use it as an excuse for common crime.
Mubarak said delays in aid to Palestinians made the West Bank and Gaza
``fertile ground for Hamas and the Jihad,'' two of the main Islamic
radical groups.
Speaking in an ornate reception room of Ittihadiya Palace, Mubarak
blamed bureaucracy by Western donor nations for the delay in aid to the
Palestinians.
He said that if lack of aid prevents development in the
Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip and West Bank ``it will be a failure
to the whole (peace) process in the Middle East.''
``Terrorism will be violent. It will be tough. Palestine will be a new,
tougher Afghanistan,'' he said. ``The whole area, including the
Europeans, the Arabs, everyone will be affected.''
Mubarak said President Hafez Assad of Syria ``wants to conclude a peace
agreement'' but that Assad must lay the groundwork for peace since
``even in Syria, public opinion counts.''
``I hope something could be concluded before June next year,'' he said,
``before the campaigns for the elections in Israel and the United
States.''
In discussing Iraq, Mubarak said the Iraqi people were the main victims
of economic sanctions: ``We have to find a way or a formula to help the
people. ... They are suffering, they are crying.''
But he added the time was not right for lifting the sanctions until
Iraq implements all U.N. Security Council demands that grew out of the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
``Just promises or signatures or papers are not sufficient,'' he said,
referring to Iraq's statement last week recognizing the borders of
Kuwait.
``The Gulf countries and other Arabs don't trust Saddam. They will
never believe him,'' he said. He added, however, that most Arab nations
did not want to see Iraq fall apart because that would leave Iran as
the main power in the Gulf.
He stopped short of calling for Saddam's overthrow, saying that was a
decision for the Iraqi people.
``It is the will of the people,'' he said. ``If the will of the people
is that Saddam will stay and (they) keep suffering, it's their way.''
Mubarak said Egyptian fundamentalists are being funded from abroad. He
said Iranian businessmen were among those supplying money. He also said
funds for Islamic causes are being collected in mosques in the United
States but that there is no proof the money is used for terrorism.
He said terrorists use Islam as ``an excuse'' because ``it is a very
good source to collect money.''
He said ``those who are committing crimes have no idea about Islam. ...
Some of them have never prayed.''
Mubarak also said his government was moving cautiously forward with a
plan to sell off its vast business empire.
``We cannot do like the former Soviet Union did. ... It would be a
collapse,'' he said.
