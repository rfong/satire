Malaysia, Singapore Should Be Conscious Of Each 
Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar said today that Malaysia and Singapore
should always be conscious of each other's sensitivity and feelings in
all matters.
The cooperative relations between the two countries, developed over the
years, have brought many mutual benefits, he said.
"However, being neighbors, we need always be mindful of the realities
that shape our relationship," the king was quoted as saying by the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama after receiving the credentials
of new Singapore High Commissioner to Malaysia Kesavapany Krishnasamy
here.
Tuanku Ja'afar stressed that paramount in such a relationship is the
consciousness of each other's sensitivities and feelings in all
matters.
The supreme head of Malaysia made the statement in the wake of recent
press reports by both Singapore and Malaysia on each other's social
problems, which had negative impacts on the two countries' ties.
"We are of the view that certain facts of history which could
complicate our relations should not stand in the way of our endeavor to
cooperate for the common good," the king said.
He noted that the two countries are not only close geographically, but
also share a common history and their peoples have inherited common
traditions and family ties across the causeway.
He believed that the proximity of the two countries offers
opportunities for fruitful cooperation and such potentials could only
be realized if leaders of the two countries draw lessons from the past
and avoid pitfalls in the future.
"While there are many ties which bind us, we must also recognize the
fact that we are two different countries, but our differences, however,
should not be a cause for division as the differences should be
harnessed for the benefit of both countries," he added.
According to Bernama, the new Singapore high commissioner said the
government and people of Singapore attach great importance to relations
between the two countries, which are closely linked through common
cultural traditions, shared history and geographical proximity.
"Family ties and people-to-people links contribute to the unique
relationship between our two countries and the governments of Malaysia
and Singapore both pursue economic policies aimed at promoting peace
and prosperity in the region," Kesavapany was quoted as saying.
He pointed out that the two countries also share many common interests
in regional and international fora such as the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and the United Nations.
