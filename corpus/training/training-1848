Construction Bank Finances Infrastructure Projects 
The People's Construction Bank of China (PCBC) has pumped 8.95 billion
yuan in loans into large and medium-sized infrastructure projects so
far this year.
The projects include those producing steel, coal, electricity and crude
oil in central, northeast and east China.
One of China's four state commercial banks, PCBC has given priority to
supporting state key projects.
Over the past five years, the bank extended 120 billion yuan in loans
to help launch such large and medium-sized projects as the Baoshan
Steel and Iron Corporation in Shanghai in east China, and the Liaohe
Oil Field in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
In January, the bank arranged 1.5 billion yuan in loans for some large
and medium-sized projects, and state key projects where construction
will be completed soon or which will be put into operation in the near
future.
Officials with the bank point out that their loans have reached the
infrastructure projects more on time than those for other projects.
