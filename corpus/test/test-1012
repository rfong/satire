Swiss hand over papers on Bofors bribery case 
The Swiss government on Tuesday handed over to India bank documents
that promise to reveal the names of individuals believed to have taken
bribes from Swedish arms maker Bofors in a billion dollar gun deal in
the 1980s.
The papers, sealed in a box, were given by officials of the Federal
Office of Police to India's ambassador in Bern seven years after the
Indian authorities sought Switerland's help in the case.
"Of course, in bank documents there will be names, it is clear," said
Michel Andre Fels, the official who has handled the Bofors case in
Switzerland, in response to a question about what the documents
contain.
Bofors in 1986 won a 1.3 billion dollar deal to supply 410 field guns
to India amid stiff international competition.
Allegations surfaced in 1987 that the firm had paid kickbacks of almost
50 million dollars to Indian politicians and officials through Swiss
bank accounts to secure the contract.
The scandal brought down Rajiv Gandhi's Congress led government.
"The investigation really starts now," said J. Singh, director of
India's Central Bureau of Intelligence, who was also at the handover
ceremony which took place in Bern's paliament building.
He declined to say when the papers would be examined, saying only they
would arrive in India's capital in two or three days time.
"We will take them to New Delhi and present them in sealed form to the
court," Singh said, adding there would be action in "less than a week."
Another batch of bank documents, also from Geneva, are expected to be
handed over in the summer.
