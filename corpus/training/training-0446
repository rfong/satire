Kenya Closes All Embassies Abroad 
The Kenyan government Wednesday ordered the closure of all its 34
embassies around the world to avoid any further attacks by Kurdish
protesters following the Turkish government's capture of Abdullah
O'calan, leader of the Turkistan Workers Party.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacob Chumba said that none of his country's
embassies worldwide would open and they would remain closed until the
security situation is improved.
O'calan sneaked into Kenya on February 2 with the assistance of Greek
Ambassador George Costorlas and left the country on February 15 under
the strong demand of the Kenyan government . Ocalan is now under
Turkish custody.
It is learned here that pro-Kurdish activists stormed Kenyan embassies
in Vienna, , Bonn, Paris Tuesday, mistaking Kenya for having a role in
making the rebel Kurdish leader captured by the Turkish authorities.
