COMESA boss on forced leave over maladministration charges 
The Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) has sent its
executive secretary on three-months long forced leave to facilitate a
probe into allegations of mismanagement levelled against him, a local
daily reported Saturday.
The decision to send Malawian Bingu Wa Mutharika on leave was reached
Friday at a COMESA council of ministers meeting in the Zambian capital
where COMESA has its headquarters.
The meeting also appointed a five-member team to investigate the
"serious" allegations of maladministration that now threaten the future
of the organisation which has just lost two member countries.
Mozambique and Lesotho have withdrawn from the two-year-old 23-member
regional trade body, while Namibia is contemplating following suit.
Allegations levelled against Mutharika include financial mismanagement
and unwarranted trips to Zimbabwe, his wife's home country where he
also owns a farm.
He is further accused of making frequent trips to Malawi, his home
country where he is said to be involved in opposition politics and is
believed to be vying for the presidency.
Quoting unnamed sources, the Herald report said Mutharika had initially
contested the decision saying it would be illegal to sack him, but the
ministers had to clarify to him that he was only being removed from the
office to facilitate unfettered investigations into the organisation's
activities.
The probe team is headed by Zambia. The other countries involved are
Kenya, Rwanda, Zaire and Zimbabwe.
