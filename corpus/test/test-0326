Roger Federer Worried Fans Only Like Him For His Tennis Record
Following Roger Federer's straight-set victory last Sunday against Fernando
Gonzalez at this year's Australian Open, the 10-time Grand Slam winner
complained to reporters that fans only like him because of his outstanding
record on the tennis court, not his personality. "Sometimes, I have to ask
myself: If I weren't the number-one ranked player in the world, would I be
getting all this attention?" said Federer, who admitted that he would
rather hear the cheers of thousands after telling one of his "signature
jokes" instead of after a crosscourt winner. "People don't know, but I'm a
pretty fun, normal guy. In between practicing for tennis, thinking about
tennis, and playing tennis, I like to eat meals, sometimes with somebody."
Federer added that in order to bring his personality to the forefront, he
plans on "torching the field" at this year's Wimbledon while wearing an
"eclectic, slightly different shade of white."
