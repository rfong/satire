Russian cold snap claims first victims 
A cold snap has claimed its first victims in Moscow, where five people
died this week as daytime temperatures dropped below minus 20 degrees
Celsius, public health officials said Thursday.
One victim of the Russian winter was found Tuesday, two were found
Wednesday and two more Thursday, the officials told AFP.
The victims included two homeless people -- a category particularly
hard-hit by the cold, along with drunks.
The officials said 38 people had been hospitalised suffering from
hypothermia by Thursday.
During the winter the city authorities regularly broadcast messages to
Muscovites calling on them to help drunks and down-and-outs in the
streets to reach warm places.
Moscow television also broadcasts the addresses of the handful of
refuges for homeless people in the capital.
Last winter more than 500 people died of cold in Moscow between
November and March.
