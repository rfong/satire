Two days after Jacques Delors refused the Socialist nomination for next
spring's presidential elections, Bernard Tapie stepped forward this
week and, with his customary panache, reassured the French left that
not all was lost.
The self-made millionaire-turned-politician said he regretted that
Delors, who retires next month as head of the European Union's
executive commission, had decided not to run. But he insisted that the
left still stood a chance if it could agree on a program and then pick
a respected outsider as its candidate.
It was a measure of the Socialists' gloom that they were willing to
listen to him. Tapie had contributed to the Socialist debacle in
elections for the European Parliament in June by leading his own
ticket, which won 12 percent of the vote.
Now, however, just 24 hours after he issued his call for leftist unity,
Tapie has himself been apparently eliminated as a political player. On
Wednesday, he was declared bankrupt by a commercial court in Paris and
barred from running for office. Under French law, people found
personally bankrupt cannot hold political office for five years.
Tapie has appealed. But if the ruling is confirmed, he will have to
resign his seats in the French National Assembly and the European
Parliament. He also still faces charges, including tax evasion, in
other pending cases.
Ever defiant, Tapie accused the court of aligning itself with the
conservative government and declared: ``The struggle continues.'' But
his bankruptcy nonetheless struck another blow at the left's hopes of
mounting a credible challenge to the conservatives, who govern France
in a coalition and control more than 80 percent of the seats in the
National Assembly.
So far, only Jacques Chirac, a former prime minister who heads the
Gaullist party, has announced his bid for the conservative nomination.
But polls show that he is running far behind Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur, who is expected to announce his candidacy next month.
In practice, under France's two-round electoral system, those two men
as well as other conservative candidates can test their strength in the
first round of voting on April 23. And if Chirac and Balladur emerged
as the two top vote-getters, they would face each other in the run-off
on May 7.
Delors's withdrawal has increased the chances of that happening. Until
he rejected the Socialist nomination, polls showed him ahead of both
Chirac and Balladur. But this reflected his own popularity and not that
of the Socialists.
Indeed, the main reason he gave for not running was that he did not
want to ``cohabit'' with a conservative prime minister who was
unwilling to carry out his program. The implication was clear: Even if
he won and called new parliamentary elections, the Socialists would not
win a majority.
The Socialists have given themselves until late January to find a new
candidate, and several names have already been mentioned, most
prominently that of Jack Lang, a former culture minister. Michel
Rocard, a former prime minister who sought the nomination before he was
eclipsed by Delors, has said he will not run.
A key question, though, is whether the Socialists will heed the advice
offered by Tapie this week. He warned that they will lose unless they
form a broad coalition of anti-conservative forces and pick a fresh
face from outside the party as its candidate. He even suggested a name
-- Robert Badinter, a Mitterrand ally who is now president of France's
Constitutional Court.
