For/IN three/CD hours/NNS or/CC so/RB England/NNP and/CC their/PRP$ fans/NNS had/VBD harboured/VBN hopes/NNS of/IN an/DT epic/NN recovery/NN in/IN this/DT third/JJ Cornhill/NNP Test/NNP ./.

Cork/NN --/: nursing/VBG a/DT badly/RB bruised/JJ finger/NN of/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ --/: added/VBD three/CD more/JJR prize/NN scalps/NNS to/TO the/DT one/CD wicket/NN he/PRP had/VBD gained/VBN the/DT evening/NN before/RB as/IN West/NNP Indies/NNP stumbled/VBD from/IN 104/CD for/IN one/CD to/TO 198/CD for/IN six/CD ./.

At/IN that/DT stage/NN the/DT tourists/NNS were/VBD only/RB 51/CD runs/NNS ahead/RB ./.

But/CC then/RB Lady/NNP Luck/NNP turned/VBD her/PRP$ back/NN on/IN England/NNP and/CC smiled/VBD serenely/RB in/IN Richardson/NNP 's/POS direction/NN ./.

Television/NNP replays/NNS suggested/VBD that/IN Zimbabwe/NNP umpire/NN Ian/NNP Robinson/NNP should/MD have/VB upheld/VBN an/DT appeal/NN for/IN a/DT catch/NN behind/IN when/WRB West/NNP Indies/NNP captain/NN was/VBD facing/VBG Angus/NNP Fraser/NNP and/CC had/VBD scored/VBN only/RB four/CD ./.

Cork/NNP found/VBD the/DT outside/JJ edge/NN but/CC a/DT low/JJ ,/, right-handed/JJ chance/NN failed/VBD to/TO stick/VB ./.

For/IN having/VBG clawed/VBN their/PRP$ way/NN back/RP from/IN a/DT horrible/JJ first/JJ day/NN position/NN ,/, England/NNP were/VBD slowly/RB but/CC surely/RB put/VBN on/IN the/DT defensive/NN once/RB more/RBR by/IN Richardson/NNP ./.

His/PRP$ innings/NNS of/IN 69/CD was/VBD full/JJ of/IN character/NN and/CC concentration/NN --/: a/DT perfect/JJ riposte/NN to/TO those/DT Caribbean/JJ supporters/NNS who/WP called/VBD for/IN his/PRP$ head/NN under/IN the/DT Lord/NNP 's/POS pavilion/NN less/JJR than/IN a/DT fortnight/NN ago/RB following/VBG a/DT series-levelling/JJ home/NN victory/NN ./.

Bishop/NNP helped/VBD him/PRP to/TO add/VB 62/CD precious/JJ runs/NNS for/IN the/DT seventh/JJ wicket/NN and/CC ,/, by/IN the/DT time/NN spinner/NN Richard/NNP Illingworth/NNP winkled/VBD out/RP the/DT tailender/NN ,/, West/NNP Indies/NNP were/VBD back/RB in/IN control/NN ./.
