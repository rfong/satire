Two Championships Judges Likely to Face Sanctions 
The International Skating Union (ISU) is likely to sanction two judges
who allegedly exchanged information in defiance of the rules during the
pairs final at the world championships on Wednesday night.
A film taken by Canadian television and submitted to officials on
Thursday appears to show the judges, Ukrainian Alfred Korytek and
Sviatoslav Babenko of Russia, communicated when judging information of
the Chinese and Polish pairs, the silver and bronze medallists in the
event.
Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo of China, who finished second after their
technically flawless performance at the free skating event, won the
vote of the spectators while the Russian pairs Elena Berezhnaia Anton
Sikharulidze earned the judges support to take the title.
The chairperson of the ISU's figure skating technical committee,
Sally-Anne Stapleford of Britain, said: "We have looked at the video
and it doesn't look particularly good. There appears to have been some
kind of communication.
"We will study the (referee's) report and make recommendations for
sanction if we feel sanction is required," she added.
Pairs referee Heli Abbondati of Finland studied the film before the
traditional end-of-event meeting with her nine judges on Thursday.
Under ISU rules, she has six weeks to submit her report to the
technical Committee.
