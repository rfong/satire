Sweden's Autoliv to supply new airbag head protection to BMW 7-series 
Swedish safety belt and airbag specialist Autoliv has won a contract
with German carmaker BMW to supply airbag head protection for side
impact to the BMW 7-series, Autoliv said on Thursday.
Autoliv spokesman Mats Oedman refused to comment on the value of the
deal.
"That remains to be seen," he told AFP, noting, however, that "this is
an entirely new market, and a technical breakthrough" developed
together with BMW.
Contrary to other airbags, the head protection airbag, which is stored
in the roof, remains inflated on impact to cushion the blow, Oedman
said.
Sales will start in June.
Meanwhile, Autoliv, which will merge with US group Morton's Airbag to
form the world's largest manufacturer of airbags, announced that the
merged company would have total sales of 3.2 billion dollars, based on
1996 pro forma information.
Operating profit would total 348.7 million dollars, and net profit
176.9 million dollars. Annual dividends from the company were seen at
44 cents.
Autoliv included the figures in a US and international offer mailed to
shareholders on Thursday.
According to the merger agreement reached in September, Autoliv's
shareholders will trade in their shares for 53.5 percent of the new
company, while Morton's shareholders will trade in their shares for
46.5 percent.
The company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will
have its head offices in London. Stockholm and Utah will be home to
regional head offices.
Autoliv, a former subsidiary of Swedish white goods manufacturer
Electrolux, has skyrocketed on the Swedish bourse since its
introduction in June 1994.
The company holds one-fifth of the world market for car safety
equipment. Its two main competitors are Takata of Japan, with 20
percent, and TRW of the US with 25 percent.
Some 90 percent of Autoliv's sales are in Europe. By joining forces
with Morton, the company will also become strong in Japan and the
United States.
