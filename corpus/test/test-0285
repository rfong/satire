Three Documents On Macao Transition Adopted (2)
Qian said that the 2nd clause of Article 24 of the Basic Law relates to
the permanent residency status of Macao residents, and after repeated
discussion by the Preparatory Committee, it will help encourage Macao
residents to stay there and work for the region.
Qian said that this year is crucial to the return of Macao to the
motherland and outlined the major tasks of the Preparatory Committee
for the new year.
Preparatory Committee members will form the Selection Committee for the
First SAR Government, select candidates for the first Chief Executive,
determine the positions of principal officials of the SAR government,
and decide on a framework for governmental institutions.
In addition, members will work out election or transition methods for
the first legislature and judiciary of the Macao SAR, examine Macao's
existing laws, and help form an unofficial committee responsible for
celebrating Macao's return.
Qian emphasized that the smooth transition and transfer of power of
Macao are the responsibility of both China and Portugal and he asked
Portuguese Macao authorities to take steps to improve security in
Macao, and pledged his support in this.
He expressed the hope that both sides will continue negotiation and
cooperation on transition issues like the localization of senior civil
servants, the handover ceremony, the garrison, and Macao's budget for
the year 2000.
