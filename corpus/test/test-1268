Volvo Car Sales Up 14 Percent, Trucks 21 Percent 
Volvo boosted car sales 14 percent and truck sales 21 percent in the
first quarter this year over last year, its chief executive told
shareholders Wednesday.
The Nordic region's biggest industrial company also will keep selling
off its non-automotive subsidiaries, with the aim of shedding them
completely by year's end, Soeren Gyll said.
Gyll outlined the results during an annual shareholders' meeting. The
company with 75,000 employees continued on a positive path this year
after two years of divestments, he said.
Volvo sold 107,600 cars in the first three months of this year,
compared with 94,500 in the same period a year ago. It sold 361,000
autos last year and aims to sell roughly 500,000 cars annually by year
2000, he said.
Volvo's truck sales rose from roughly 16,100 to 19,500 units. Gyll did
not give a target figure for truck sales.
The chief executive reiterated the group's ambition to streamline its
operations. Volvo already has sold its Procordia Food AB subsidiary to
Orkla of Norway, and last week sold off its Alfred Berg brokerage
operations.
By 1996, Volvo hopes to have shed all its subsidiary operations,
although Gyll did not say which may be next.
Gyll said Volvo will work on expanding its share of existing markets
and also will look for growth markets.
Volvo's truck and transport group, for example, will look for expansion
in the Far East. Growth in this area, he said, will balance slower
trends expected in Europe in coming years. Its goal is to be the
world's No. 1 heavy truck maker by 2010.
Volvo posted pretax profits last year of 16.4 billion kronor (dlrs 2.2
billion) up from 2.64 billion kronor (dlrs 361 million) loss the
previous year.
