French musician wins damages over other woman article 
A judge ordered a weekly scandal magazine Tuesday to pay 50,000 francs
(10,000 dollars) to French synthesizer superstar Jean-Michel Jarre for
invasion of privacy -- but did not entirely spare his blushes in the
case.
Judge Marie-Therese Feydeau said the composer of Oxygene and Equinoxe
and his British wife Charlotte Rampling had not always shown complete
discretion and should not be surprised at their treatment.
Jarre had been demanding the withdrawal of this week's edition of the
magazine Voici over an article and photographs suggesting he has been
seeing another woman.
He had also been demanding one million francs in damages against the
magazine.
Feydeau said the magazine "incontestably pried on the private life of
Jean-Michel Jarre," and she therefore ordered the 50,000 francs damages
to be paid by the publishers of the magazine, Prisma Presse.
But she added that the article should not have surprised Jarre. "It
does not seem he was surprised in an intimate situation, since the
photos were taken in a public place," she said.
She added that the couple "have not always shown the utmost discretion
when it comes to their relations as a couple" and therefore rejected
their demand for a larger payout.
The magazine is no stranger to being taken to court by celebrities. A
front page apology to French actress Isabelle Adjani obscured the
Jarre-Rampling story in this week's edition.
