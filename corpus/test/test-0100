Bangladeshi Opposition Movement Marked by Violence 
Sporadic bomb blasts and minor clashes occurred here today, the first
day of the opposition-called indefinite non-cooperation movement
against the February 15 elections.
Police sources confirmed that several people were injured and five of
them were brought to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital after being
wounded in separate bomb blasts in the capital.
The non-cooperation movement is the second in the past 15 days launched
by the mainstream opposition parties -- the Awami (People's) League,
the Jatiya (National) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami.
The opposition parties are demanding cancellation of the February 15
polls, resignation of the present government and fresh national
elections under a neutral undertaker government.
Official sources said attendance was normal in government, semi
government and autonomous institutions. But most of the private offices
were closed today.
All motor vehicles remained off the streets for the day while railway
and long-distance road transport were also disrupted. But water
transport and all flights, both in international and domestic routes,
were unaffected.
