Washington urges Iran, Iraq to stay out of Kurd conflict 
Iran and Iraq should stay out of the Kurdish conflict in northern Iraq,
US State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Thursday.
"We have the beginning of a diplomatic process. We need time," said
Burns, referring to US efforts to end the fighting between the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Massud Barzani and the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) of Jalal Talabani.
Burns warned that "it would be a great mistake by Saddam Hussein" if
press reports of Iraqi troop movements toward the north are correct.
Meanwhile, a KDP delegation led by Barzani's nephew, Narjevan, met at
the State Department on Thursday in the presence of British and Turkish
diplomats.
The US delegation, led by Robert Deutsch, head of the State
Department's Iraq and Iran bureau, emphasized the "need to move quickly
toward a cease-fire" and to ensure the safety of humanitarian groups
working in the troubled region, Burns said.
Robert Pelletreau, assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, is
set to leave Washington this weekend to meet separately with Barzani
and Talabani. Both have agreed to meet with Pelletreau, but the date
and the location has not been set, Burns said.
Fighting between the Kurdish factions has flared since the KDP seized
the main Kurdish city of Arbil on August 31 in an offensive backed by
Iraqi troops and tanks.
The United States fired cruise missiles at Iraqi air defenses to punish
Baghdad for its foray into the Kurdish-populated north and expanded a
no-flight zone in southern Iraq.
PUK forces launched a counter-offensive last weekend, prompting KDP's
Barzani to accuse the PUK of getting support from Iran and seek help
from Washington.
