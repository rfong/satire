Cotton Importers Warned of Quality Problems 
The State Administration of Import and Export Commodities Inspection
(SACI) has sounded an alarm for the domestic cotton industry, today's
China Daily reported .
SACI has called the attention of business people in the industry and
related authorities to the problems of imported cotton and measures to
curb those problems.
According to China's customs statistics, some 460,000 tons of cotton,
worth 808 million US dollars, were imported in the first half of this
year, a 14 percent hike from last year.
However, many of those imports have quality or quantity problems,
especially from the United States, SACI said in a written statement
last week.
Of the 788 batches of cotton imported in the period, 89 percent proved
to be substandard, which was two percentage points higher than last
year.
Besides the poor quality, more and more cotton imports are not as heavy
as claimed, the statement said.
The customs statistics indicate China imported 1.1 million tons of
cotton in the past year and a half. However, only 960,000 tons were
examined by SACI.
The problems of imported cotton have greatly hurt the interest of
Chinese cotton farmers and business people, the statement said.
SACI suggests that the quality of domestically produced cotton be
upgraded and its distribution network be improved to narrow the price
gap between domestic and foreign cotton.
It also advises importers or end-users make clear in their importing
contracts that transactions should be based on SACI's inspection
results and consign the inspection of the imported cotton to SACT's
overseas branches to prevent more losses.
