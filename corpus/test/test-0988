China, Taiwan enmity threatens diplomatic upheaval
China's traditional enmity with its nationalist rival Taiwan threatened
to develop into a full-scale diplomatic incident Thursday -- involving
the United States, Japan and a possible Chinese boycott of the Asian
Games.
The situation has developed amid fears within the Chinese government
that Taiwan's policy of using its enormous economic clout to end
decades of international isolation -- imposed at Beijing's behest -- is
bearing fruit.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang slammed Washington's
announcement Wednesday that it would review -- for the first time in 15
years -- its policy of maintaining informal contacts with Taiwan, and
warned that any US attempt to upgrade its relations with Taipei would
"seriously" damage Sino-US relations.
At the same time, he also warned Japan against allowing Taiwanese
President Lee Teng-hui to attend the Asian Games in Hiroshima next
month if it wants to avoid harming ties between Beijing and Tokyo.
That row has given rise to speculation that China might boycott the
Games if Lee is allowed to attend. The country's sports officials have
already raised the possibility.
A US State Department official announced Wednesday in Washington that
the United States will take economic and trade ties with Taiwan to a
higher level and support Taipeh's entry into international
organisations such as GATT.
The US announcement amounted to an "upgrading" of Washington's
relations with Taipei and "violated the principles" of existing Sino-US
joint communiques on the Taiwan issue, Shen said.
"The US move to adopt measures that will upgrade relations with Taiwan
will seriously affect the development of bilateral relations," he
added.
China has viewed Taiwan as a rebel province ever since nationalist
forces fled to the island in 1949 after losing the civil war. Beijing
bars any country with which it has diplomatic relations from
maintaining ties with Taipei.
The United States officially recognised the People's Republic of China
in 1979, breaking off relations with Taiwan.
While the US announcement reaffirmed Washington's commitment to its
"one China" policy -- recognising Beijing as the sole legitimate
government of all China, of which Taiwan is an integral part -- it
spoke of the desire to "strenghten our unofficial economic and
commercial ties" with the nationalist island.
A senior US administration official admitted that the economic weight
of Taiwan -- now the fifth-ranking US trade partner -- had prompted the
renewal of informal contacts.
"China's main concern is that what it sees as Taiwan's cheque-book
diplomacy is paying off," said one western diplomat.
"Taiwan has already made some inroads regionally, and while the US move
is relatively low key, Beijing is clearly anxious to nip any expansion
of Taiwan's influence in the bud," the diplomat said.
On the question of the Asian Games, the foreign ministry spokesman
warned that "the political problems will be serious and will involve
many areas" if the Taiwanese president were allowed to attend.
"We hope Japan and the organising committee of the Asian Games will be
prudent in this affair, and that the Japanese government will consider
the general interest of Sino-Japanese relations," Shen said.
On Wednesday, Taiwan's foreign ministry informed Japan that Lee would
be attending.
However, Japanese press reports Thursday quoted a government source in
Tokyo as saying "the country with diplomatic ties is more important
than the country without them" -- suggesting that Japan might refuse
Lee an entry visa.
