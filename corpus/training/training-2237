Flynn attacks failure on joint European policing 
The European Union has failed to agree on ways of boosting cooperation
on policing and judicial matters, outgoing EU Justice Commissioner
Padraig Flynn said Thursday.
Flynn, a former Irish justice minister, slammed a meeting of justice
ministers in Brussels Thursday at which the ministers could not agree
on how to increase cooperation between their police forces.
One of the main points of dissent was access by EU member states to
data collected by an inter-European policing network, Europol.
Bonn wants such access to be limited to experts working directly for
Europol while Paris is calling for a much more open approach that would
allow access to "liaison officers" appointed to Europol by EU member
states.
Diplomats said Wednesday that Greece and Spain backed the French
initiative while Britain is backing Germany, which has called at least
28 meetings over the past few months in a bid to get the treaty signed.
Flynn said that the ministers had failed to agree a Europol Convention
or to make any progress on joint measures against illegal entry into
the European Union.
Doctrinal arguments blocked progress in the discussions, Flynn said.
There was no difference between EU policy now and before the Maatricht
Treaty, which was supposed to have boosted trans-European police
cooperation, the commissioner complained.
Flynn also attacked the member states for conducting their discussions
in secret and criticising the commission when it called for accounts to
be made public.
The commissioner said Europe-wide cooperation on policing and justice
was a matter that effected the member states' populations in their
everyday lives and fears.
