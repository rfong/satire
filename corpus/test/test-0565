Young Scientist Advocates Industrialization of Hi-tech (2)
"I am bent on researching genetic medicines and technologies of
bio-genetic engineering to be used in China's agricultural sector, and
hope to use my wisdom to pay back the society," Chen said.
Chen received the 1991 Javed Husain Prize for Young Scientists in
recognition of his outstanding contributions to gene conversion
research and gene molecular adjustment and control at the headquarters
of UNESCO in Paris on October 28, 1991, the youngest individual winner
of this prize since 1987.
In 1994, he was picked by "Time" magazine of the United States as one
of the 100 scientists in the world with the most potential.
"I was born into a poor fisherman's family in southeast China's Fujian
Province in 1961, and I am among those Chinese students who studied
abroad and then returned to China," Chen said.
He went to school at the age of nine, and was recruited by the South
China Institute of Tropical Plants in Hainan Province at the age of 17.
In 1987, Chen returned to China after graduating with a Ph.D. degree
from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. Answering the
Chinese government's call, this promising young man returned to China
to build the country's first botanical gene engineering laboratory.
The national laboratory for protein and plant genetic engineering at
Beijing University constructed by Chen himself can be used for the most
advanced botanical gene-engineering research in the world.
"There are nine returned students working with me in my laboratory,"
said Chen proudly, adding that the number of returned Chinese students
will further increase as China has adopted a series of favorable
policies to encourage the students to return.
Professor Chen now also serves as vice-chairman of the All- China Youth
Federation, director of the Life Sciences Academy of Beijing
University, and as a member of the committee of China's first high
technology research plan, "Program 863."
Chen is now a nationally known scientist with many titles: vice-
president of the All-China Youth Federation, deputy to the National
People's Congress, member of the country's education, science and
culture committee, member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
Scientists' Association; advisor to the British magazine Botany; member
of the International Biochemistry Consultative Committee, member of the
Specialist Committee on Biology of the "863" High Technology Program,
and member of the Editorial Board of the American journal Genetics.
Chen has also been invited to deliver a speech before the chief
executive officers (CEO) of large multinational companies attending the
upcoming '99 Fortune Global Forum in Shanghai later this month.
The fences around colleges and universities will gradually disappear in
the 21st century, with the rapid development of information and high
technologies, and this trend will allow universities to become the most
important incubator of new technologies, Chen plans to tell the CEOs
gathering in Shanghai.
