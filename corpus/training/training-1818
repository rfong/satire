7 Injured in Clash Around Parliament Building in Jakarta 
At least seven people, including two policemen, were injured in a clash
between demonstrators and police around the Parliament building in
Central Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, on Monday afternoon.
The clash took place when hundreds of demonstrators rushed into the
complex of the Parliament at 13:50 p.m. local time.
The demonstrators came to the Parliament to support or oppose a probe
into whether President Abdurrahman Wahid is implicated in two financial
scandals.
Legislators have been holding a plenary meeting at the Parliament to
discuss the result of investigations made by the House special
committee on the Buloggate and Bruneigate fund scams.
Buloggate involves the disappearance of 35 billion rupiah (3.3 million
U.S. dollars) from the National Logistics Agency (Bulog) and allegedly
involves Suwondo, the president's former masseur, former Bulog deputy
chief and the president.
Bruneigate relates to the acceptance by Wahid outside government
channels of a 2 million U.S. dollar donation from the Sultan of Brunei.
The president says it was a personal gift from the sultan for
humanitarian aid in troubled Aceh province.
