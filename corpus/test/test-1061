Defending champion Steffi Graf reached the quarter-finals of the
women's singles when her third-round Czech opponent Petra Langrova was
forced to retire after pulling a groin muscle.
Graf, who was leading 6-0, 1-0 on Roland Garros' number-one show-court,
now plays either eleventh-seed Mary Joe Fernandez of the United States
or 'lucky-loser' Gloria Pizzichini of Italy.
Langrova, ranked a modest 205th, had played the qualifying tournament
for a place in the main draw.
Graf was steaming home and leading 5-0 after just 17 minutes Langrova
took a three-minute injury time-out.
The 26-year-old German player meanwhile delighted the crowd by giving
one of her rackets to a ball-boy and holding a rally.
Langrova returned and tried to play on but she was clearly in pain. She
did not win another point in the next two games.
Graf, seeded to play her great rival and joint world number-one Monica
Seles in next Saturday's final, is bidding for a fifth title win after
her 1987, 1988, 1993 and 1995 triumphs.
Iva Majoli flirted with disaster before reaching the last-sixteen.
The fifth-seeded Croatian, playing 39th-ranked Sandrine Testud of
France, dropped the first set and had to fight her way back from 3-5 in
the second and then win a marathon eleventh game with the scores level
at 5-5, before clinching a 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 victory.
The match lasted 2hrs 45mins.
Majoli now plays either 16th-seeded Austrian Barbara Paulus or Gala
Leon Garcia of Spain for a place in the last-four.
Kimiko Date, who rewrote the history books twelve months ago by
becoming the first Japanese player to reach the semi-finals, also moved
into the fourth round when she beat American Linda Wild 6-3, 7-5.
The seventh-seeded Japanese player now plays either slimmed-down ninth
seed Lindsay Davenport of the United States, who won in Strasbourg last
weekend, or Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia.
