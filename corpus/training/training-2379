Landmark Supreme Court Ruling Recognizes Gay Couples 
The Supreme Court handed Israel's gay community a major victory
Wednesday in a landmark ruling recognizing gay couples.
The 50-page decision forces the national airline El Al to grant the
boyfriend of flight attendant Jonathan Danielevitz the annual free
tickets and other benefits due heterosexual partners of its workers.
The case had wound its way up Israel's court system for five years,
reaching the Supreme Court after El Al's appealed a regional labor
court ruling in favor of Danielevitz, a native South African in his
40s.
El Al spokesman Nachman Kleiman said the company would ``honor and
abide by the decision in its entirety.'' He said there was no precedent
for El Al extending the rights to unmarried couples.
No reaction was available from Danielevitz. Press reports say he has
lived with his unidentified partner for 15 years.
Gay rights activists argued the ruling would have widespread
significance in Israel, which remains a relatively conservative society
on homosexuality.
``This will affect all walks of life...We will try to apply this
decision to other areas,'' said Ilan Shenfeld, a leading gay rights
activist.
