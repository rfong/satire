Hunger grips Siberian mining towns as payments crisis deepens
In the grimy mining town of Kemerovo in western Siberia the air is
thick not only with coaldust, but also with the despair of hungry
workers and pensioners who have not been paid for months.
At the Severny-East pit on the edge of town miners drag on their last
cigarettes before descending deep underground for a six-hour shift of
arduous, dangerous work.
Instead of the million-ruble (166-dollar) salary they should be
getting, they have received hand-outs of just 200,000 rubles (35
dollars), in the run-up to a general strike announced for Thursday.
From October to February they got "not a single kopeck," they said.
Of some three million people living in the Kuzbass mining region,
200,000 are miners.
Sixty percent of the region's workers are paid irregularly, or in goods
instead of cash, and up to 40 percent of them are destitute, said
Leonid Gordon, a Moscow-based expert on Russian labour movements.
In Kemerovo last week First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais
promised that the government would pay its debts to pensioners in the
region by June 30 and to workers by December 30.
The government's wage arrears nationwide have risen to 50 trillion
rubles (8.7 billion dollars).
Nearly half a million coalminers went on strike in December, in one of
the biggest mass protests in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991.
Pavel Kortoshov said he had looked for work elsewhere. "But what else
can I do? Where can I go? The situation is the same throughout the
Kuzbass. You have to survive one way or another, and I don't want to
lose this job," he told AFP.
Kortoshov lives in the mining settlement of Krukoy, home to 2,000
people -- a collection of pastel-painted wooden shacks.
Beyond the muddy alleys of the settlement rise the chimneys of the
mine, spewing out black clouds.
Nelly Kotelnikova was busy gardening on her small vegetable plot, after
spending a day teaching English in the local school.
"Keeping a vegetable plot is the only way to survive when you don't get
paid for months," said Kotelnikova, in her 50s.
"Hardly any of the children can pay the 40,000 rubles for school
dinners. The headmaster decided to offer free meals in the first two
months of this year. But they had to stop that in March, and some kids
didn't even have bread to eat at lunchtime. Their parents have no
money."
The school does not have any money for new books.
"The local administration doesn't pay for anything. They're not
interested," complained Kotelnikova.
At the home of Nikolai Belyulin, 65, the fridge was bare except for a
cabbage and some sausages.
His wardrobe had only a few worn clothes inside.
"All that I have dates back to the Soviet period. I haven't bought
anything new, except the television," said the enraged pensioner, who
spent 30 years toiling in the mines.
Before the collapse of the Soviet Union he earned 418 rubles a month,
and by now he should have been receiving a pension of 176 rubles.
However, inflation and payment delays have taken their toll.
His old pension would have been a lot compared with the current pension
of 490,000 rubles -- which he has not received for four months. In the
Soviet Union, a loaf of bread cost 18 kopecks, compared with 2,500
rubles now.
He said he had just received his February pension -- "time for a
holiday," he added, with a bitter smile.
He was still awaiting his November, December and January payments.
Previously his children helped him, but like other miners, they have
not been paid for months either.
Belyulin and his wife Yelizaveta have just enough to buy some bread,
sugar and milk.
"We're lucky -- we sometimes eat meat, whereas 80 percent of pensioners
here cannot afford that," he said.
"We're starving. Most pensioners have to carry on working, when they
should be resting," she Zorina, formerly an engineer, who now works as
a receptionist at a local hospital.
Tamara Isdratova, 43, a neuropathologist at the hospital, said she
could not recall any new equipment being bought in the past eight
years.
When she gets paid she has to decide whether to spend the money on a
pair of trousers, the rent or a book for her daughter. Usually she
spends it on food, she explained.
