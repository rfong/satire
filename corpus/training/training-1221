One More Dam Put into Service in Myanmar 
One more dam, the Sitha Dam, has been commissioned into service in
Myanmar's Mandalay division, bringing the total number of dams and
reservoirs built in the division since 1988 to 25.
The Sitha Dam, inaugurated on Thursday in Pyin Oo Lwin township of the
central and arid division with the maximum storage capacity of 234.69
hectare-meters, was built within a year at a cost of 138 million kyats
(460,000 U.S. dollars).
The 295.85-meter-long and 24.4-meter-high earth dam will supply 4.46
million liters of water in the region and will also irrigate 101.25
hectares of crop lands, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Friday.
The report quoted Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, second secretary of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, as saying that though it
is a small-scale reservoir, it will help beautify the region and enable
Pyin Oo Lwin to restore its name "the hill station."
According to official statistics, the Myanmar government built 96
irrigation facilities throughout the country in the past ten years.
