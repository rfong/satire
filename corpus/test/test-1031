Chinese dissidents in US favor partial revoking of Beijing's privileged trading status
Chinese dissidents in the United States generally favor a partial
withdrawal of Beijing's privileged trading status targeting state-owned
firms, not complete revocation, dissident leaders said here Thursday.
There are differing views among the dissident community in the United
States on the best way to advance human rights in China, but "an
overwhelming majority do agree on the middle policy of targeted
revocation," Zhao Haiching, the president of the National Council for
Chinese Affairs (NCCA) told a press conference.
China has clearly not made the significant overall progress on human
rights which President Bill Clinton said last year would be needed if
he were to extend Beijing's most favored nation (MFN) trading status
beyond June 3, Zhao said.
But withdrawing MFN altogether would make everyone suffer for the
government's intransigence, said Zhao, whose group coordinates
dissident groups in the United States pushing for human rights and
democracy in China.
Revoking MFN just for products which come mainly from state-owned
enterprises would continue US pressure on the government to improve its
human rights record, while not punishing the private sector and market
economy which everybody wants to promote, Zhao said.
Zhao also said it was the United States's own fault that its decision
to firmly link MFN to human rights this year had not borne more fruit.
Mixed signals from Washington had convinced China "that all they have
to do to win MFN is play tough, and they have been doing so," Zhao
said.
Economic officials in the government made it clear early that evoking
human rights would be an economic disaster for the United States.
Chinese dissident Wang Juntao, jailed for his part in the 1989
pro-democracy movement which was crushed in the Tiananmen Square
massacre, is in Washington this week meeting with lawmakers and US
officials.
Wang said that his release was a miracle, but urged the international
community not to forget all the political prisoners still behind bars
in China. On Wedenesday, Wang called for Washington to aintain pressure
on China but not by withdrawing MFN
Wang met for half an hour at the White House with national security
adviser Anthony Lake, with no details available from the talks,
officials said.
