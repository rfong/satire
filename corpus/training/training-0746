Solari does not believe his team's inexperience will be a factor,
saying: "Actually it has made the players more focused. They are
looking forward to showing how well they can play to the world."
The Saudis are also looking to the example of Cameroon in 1990 for
inspiration. Defender Mohamed Al Jawad said: "Nobody was giving much
credit to Cameroon before the finals in Italy but they did a very good
job. Even Egypt surprised as well."
Saudi players pay little attention to experts who dismiss them.
Football has only been at a top level there for 15 years, joining camel
racing and falconry as favored sports in a hot, sandy land of 14
million people.
"Our experience is shorter than the Europeans, but our commitment and
ability is covered and our love and devotion to our country will make
us more than a handful for them," said Majed Abdullah, their
35-year-old striker known as the "Desert Pele".
Hot, humid US weather and mid-day start times could weaken teams from
colder climates but, predictably, the Saudis expect no trouble with
temperatures.
"We have no problems with the weather," Abdullah said. "I don't think
it will affect the other teams, but if it does, it will be an advantage
for us."
