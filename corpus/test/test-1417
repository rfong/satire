Rubin holds out possibility of US contributuion to debt scheme 
US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Thursday held out the possibility
the United States could make a financial contribution to a multilateral
debt relief scheme for the world's poorest countries.
Rubin was asked about the plan, drafted earlier this year by the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, at a press conference ahead
of a meeting here Saturday of finance ministers from the seven leading
industrialized nations.
The plan, which could cost as much as 7.7 billion dollars, requires the
participation of the IMF, the World Bank, development banks and
bilateral creditors -- such as the United States -- in the Paris Club.
To finance its participation, the IMF has been debating the possibility
of selling a small part of its gold reserves and investing the
proceeds.
Rubin said the IMF appeared to have sufficient funds available to take
part in the debt relief scheme until 1999-2000.
"It's our view that once you get past that you're going to need gold,"
he said, adding that it was up to the IMF to determine how much would
have to be sold.
"What we have said is that at the time of the decision to sell gold,
we'll be prepared to go to Congress and discuss with Congress the
possibility of a bilateral contribution."
The United States in the past has made clear its reluctance to
contribute to the plan, which would target up to 20 mostly African
countries.
Another avenue by which the Paris Club could take part is an agreement
to expand the percentage at which its members reduce debt from 67 to
80.
"Our position is that the Paris Club reduction ought to be up to 80
percent," Rubin said.
The future of the debt relief effort is expected to be determined at
the annual meeting here later this week and next of the IMF and World
Bank.
IMF director Michel Camdessus announced earlier Thursday that Fund
participation in the plan was "a done deal" and said that for the
moment there would be no need to sell gold.
Speaking of the upcoming meetings here, Rubin said "we'll touch on the
global economic picture and the issues all of us face."
"The United States comes to these meetings from a position of economic
strength ... The US economy has performed remarkably well over the past
three years.
"Overall the global economy is continuing to grow at a healthy pace,
providing demand for US exports, which in turn will help sustain the US
economy."
