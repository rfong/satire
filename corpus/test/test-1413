Paris Club to reschedule Russian debt over several years 
Western creditor nations who hold 40 billion dollars in Russian debt
agreed Tuesday to reschedule payments over several years rather than on
a year-to-year basis as has been the case, Paris Club officials said.
The informal grouping of creditor countries met Tuesday with a Russian
delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Davidov to discuss a
rescheduling plan.
"The principle of a negotiation that covers more than one year has been
accepted by the creditors," said Christian Noyer, head of the Paris
Club.
The creditors could tailor the rescheduling to a program that Russia is
negotiating with the International Monetary Fund for the period
1996-98.
Russia hopes this latter program will be signed by the end of the year
and says it will need support from creditors because the IMF is
demanding more austerity measures from Moscow in exchange for fresh
loans.
Since the Group of Seven summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia in June, Russia
has been demanding from its government creditors a "global accord" on
repayments that would spare it from coming back every year to ask for
grace periods and rescheduling.
Such a global accord would allow Moscow to know just how much its needs
to repay over the next three years.
Since 1993, Russia has rescheduled its debt payments three times. The
first time involved 15 billion dollars in debt for the period 1992-93.
The second, in 1994 was for seven billion dollars and the same amount
was restructured in June of this year.
This latter accord is valid until the end of the year but can be
extended if the Paris Club does not agree on a new deal by then. But
Noyer said the group had agreed to hold another meeting with Russia
soon.
Davidoff next heads to London to meet with the 600 private banks that
hold 25 billion dollars in Russian debt. Russia says it is in the final
stages of talks with the banks on rescheduling these debt payments as
well.
The Russian finance ministry says the country's total debt, including
obligations it inherited with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991,
is 120 billion dollars.
