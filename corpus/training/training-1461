New York subway collision injures 18 
Eighteen people were injured Tuesday when a moving subway train hit a
stationary one near New York City Hall, officials said.
Some of the hurt passengers, complaining of back and neck injuries,
were taken to the hospital to be examined, said a spokesman for the
emergency rescue team, David Bookstaver.
The stopped train was empty, said Kenneth Donohue, the subway's police
chief. A probe to determine the cause of the collision was underway,
officials said.
Last July 5, a similar collision left the conductor of the moving train
dead, and injured 54.
