NZ/NNP anxious/JJ for/IN credit/NN for/IN beating/NNP Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP New/NNP Zealand/NNP cricket/NN captain/VBP Stephen/NNP Fleming/NNP hoped/VBD Monday/NNP his/PRP$ team/NN would/MD be/VB given/VBN credit/NN for/IN their/PRP$ resounding/JJ victory/NN over/IN Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP in/IN the/DT first/JJ test/NN at/IN Carisbrook/NNP here/RB ./.

The/DT Kiwis/NNPS completed/VBD a/DT clinical/JJ dissection/NN of/IN the/DT tourists/NNS when/WRB dismissing/VBG Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP late/JJ in/IN the/DT third/JJ session/NN on/IN the/DT fourth/JJ day/NN for/IN 328/CD to/TO give/VB them/PRP a/DT comprehensive/JJ win/NN by/IN an/DT innings/NNS and/CC 36/CD runs/NNS ./.

It/PRP was/VBD the/DT seventh/JJ time/NN New/NNP Zealand/NNP have/VBP secured/VBN a/DT test/NN win/VB by/IN an/DT innings/NNS margin/NN ./.

Fleming/NNP believes/VBZ the/DT time/NN has/VBZ arrived/VBN for/IN the/DT New/NNP Zealand/NNP team/NN to/TO be/VB judged/VBN solely/RB on/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ merits/NNS ,/, and/CC not/RB those/DT of/IN the/DT opposition/NN ./.

New/NNP Zealand/NNP outplayed/VBD a/DT disappointing/JJ Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP in/IN all/DT facets/NNS of/IN the/DT game/NN after/IN amassing/VBG a/DT mammoth/JJ 586/CD for/IN seven/CD declared/VBD before/IN their/PRP$ bowlers/NNS took/VBD over/RP to/TO clean/VB out/RP the/DT tourists/NNS for/IN 222/CD and/CC 328/CD ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP can/MD forget/VB about/IN Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP and/CC see/VB how/WRB well/RB we/PRP played/VBD ,/, ''/'' Fleming/NNP ,/, 23/CD ,/, told/VBD a/DT press/NN conference/NN ./.

``/`` For/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN we/PRP 've/VBP looked/VBN at/IN the/DT opposition/NN and/CC judged/VBN ourselves/PRP on/IN their/PRP$ performance/NN ./.

``/`` Our/PRP$ performance/NN here/RB put/VB Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP away/RB ./.

We/PRP did/VBD not/RB give/VB them/PRP a/DT chance/NN to/TO get/VB into/IN the/DT game/NN ./.

``/`` Perhaps/RB it/PRP looked/VBD as/RB if/IN Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP were/VBD n't/RB up/RB to/TO it/PRP but/CC they/PRP are/VBP a/DT good/JJ side/NN ./.

We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB let/VB them/PRP play/VB ./.

``/`` We/PRP batted/VBD well/NN ,/, Bryan/NNP Young/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- who/WP scored/VBD 267/CD not/RB out/RB -RRB-/-RRB- exceptionally/RB so/RB ,/, and/CC we/PRP bowled/VBD extremely/RB well/RB ,/, ''/'' Fleming/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Our/PRP$ performance/NN dominated/VBD the/DT whole/JJ match/NN ./.

We/PRP did/VBD n't/RB let/VB Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP play/VB ,/, and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ the/DT credit/NN we/PRP deserve/VBP ./. ''/''

Sri/NNP Lankan/NNP cricket/NN coach/NN Bruce/NNP Yardley/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO harness/VBZ not/RB inhibit/VB the/DT batting/JJ riches/NNS he/PRP has/VBZ to/TO work/VB with/IN ./.

Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP sparked/VBD for/IN a/DT time/NN in/IN their/PRP$ second/JJ innings/NNS of/IN 328/CD ,/, thanks/NNS almost/RB solely/RB to/TO a/DT fireworks/NNS display/NN from/IN wicketkeeper/NN Romesh/NNP Kaluwitharana/NNP ,/, who/WP rocketed/VBD his/PRP$ way/NN to/TO 103/CD from/IN as/IN many/JJ deliveries/NNS after/IN the/DT tourists/NNS were/VBD 115/CD for/IN five/CD ./.

Kaluwitharana/NNP 's/POS blazing/JJ bat/NN could/MD not/RB deny/VB New/NNP Zealand/NNP a/DT deserved/JJ win/NN ,/, but/CC Yardley/NNP appreciated/VBD the/DT boldness/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ actions/NNS ./.

He/PRP was/VBD less/RBR impressed/JJ with/IN some/DT of/IN his/PRP$ specialist/NN batsmen/NN ,/, who/WP totally/RB ignored/VBD the/DT team/NN 's/POS requirements/NNS after/IN beginning/VBG the/DT fourth/JJ day/NN Monday/NNP on/IN 37/CD without/IN loss/NN --/: 327/CD runs/NNS short/RB of/IN making/VBG New/NNP Zealand/NNP bat/NN again/RB ./.

``/`` There/EX was/VBD a/DT lack/NN of/IN concentration/NN and/CC a/DT lack/NN of/IN desire/NN ./.

We/PRP found/VBD ways/NNS of/IN getting/VBG out/RP that/IN were/VBD quite/RB silly/JJ ./.

For/IN example/NN two/CD of/IN our/PRP$ batsmen/NN got/VBN inside/IN edges/NNS when/WRB they/PRP could/MD n't/RB get/VB their/PRP$ bats/NNS out/RP of/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN the/DT ball/NN ,/, ''/'' Yardley/NNP ,/, a/DT former/JJ Australian/JJ test/NN player/NN ,/, said/VBD ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ all/DT about/IN shot/NN selection/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ guys/NNS have/VBP to/TO become/VB tougher/JJR at/IN test/NN level/NN ./.

If/IN a/DT ball/NN is/VBZ wide/JJ and/CC swinging/VBG further/RBR away/RB you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB just/RB swing/VB your/PRP$ bat/NN at/IN it/PRP ./.

``/`` You/PRP are/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO play/VB a/DT shot/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB swing/VB your/PRP$ bat/NN and/CC hope/VBP it/PRP goes/VBZ somewhere/RB ./. ''/''

Yardley/NNP would/MD be/VB the/DT last/JJ person/NN to/TO suggest/VB the/DT Sri/NNP Lankan/NNP batsmen/NN leave/VB their/PRP$ attacking/VBG strokes/NNS hidden/VBN under/IN their/PRP$ hotel/NN beds/NNS ,/, but/CC boldness/NNS often/RB translated/VBN into/IN badness/NNS in/IN this/DT test/NN for/IN the/DT tourists/NNS ./.

Kaluwitharana/NNP 's/POS belligerent/JJ innings/NNS of/IN controlled/JJ aggression/NN ,/, containing/VBG 13/CD fours/NNS and/CC two/CD sixes/NNS as/IN he/PRP spared/VBD no/DT expense/NN making/VBG the/DT Kiwis/NNP pay/NN for/IN their/PRP$ previous/JJ dominance/NN ,/, was/VBD the/DT sort/NN of/IN frontal/JJ assault/NN normally/RB reserved/VBN for/IN the/DT one-day/JJ arena/NN ./.

But/CC his/PRP$ determination/NN not/RB to/TO compromise/VB his/PRP$ approach/NN was/VBD refreshing/JJ as/IN the/DT match/NN entered/VBD its/PRP$ final/JJ stages/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PRP always/RB bat/VBD like/IN that/DT whether/IN it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN a/DT one-dayer/NN or/CC a/DT test/NN match/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT 26-year-old/JJ said/VBD after/IN his/PRP$ second/JJ test/NN century/NN to/TO follow/VB his/PRP$ maiden/JJ hundred/CD scored/NNS against/IN Australia/NNP in/IN Colombo/NNP in/IN the/DT 1992-93/CD season/NN ./.

He/PRP and/CC Chaminda/NNP Vaas/NNP ,/, who/WP made/VBD a/DT classy/JJ 57/CD himself/PRP ,/, put/VBD on/IN a/DT Sri/NNP Lankan/NNP record/JJ seventh/JJ wicket/NN partnership/NN against/IN New/NNP Zealand/NNP of/IN 137/NNP in/IN just/RB 109/CD minutes/NNS ./.

Kaluwitharana/NNP was/VBD finally/RB dislodged/VBN when/WRB teenaged/JJ left/JJ arm/NN spinner/NN Daniel/NNP Vettori/NNP held/VBD on/RP to/TO a/DT firmly/RB struck/JJ straight/JJ drive/NN which/WDT the/DT batsmen/NN failed/VBD to/TO keep/VB down/RP ./.

``/`` I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/VBN to/TO get/VB out/RP because/IN I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO bat/NN the/DT whole/JJ day/NN ,/, ''/'' Kaluwitharana/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Vaasie/NNP was/VBD batting/NN very/RB well/RB and/CC I/PRP thought/VBD we/PRP could/MD 've/VB batted/VBN for/IN another/DT session/NN or/CC two/CD ./. ''/''
