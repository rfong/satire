Taiwan's satellite project with Singapore stymied by China 
Taiwan's 215 million US dollar satellite project with Singapore has
been blocked on pressure from China, the Commercial Times said here
Monday.
Taiwan and Singapore were scheduled to sign the contract mid-September
for the launch of a communications satellite.
But under pressure from Beijing, Singapore delayed signing, the daily
said.
The delay came as a setback for Taiwan's bid to develop the island into
a regional financial, transportation and high-tech manufacturing hub
for multinational enterprises, the report said.
However, it might be revived after pressure from China subsided, it
noted.
China views Taiwan as a renegade province after it defeated the
nationalists in 1949 and drove them from the mainland.
The Taiwan government-owned Directorate General of Telecommunicaitons
(DGT) planned to cooperate with Singapore Telecom in launching the
satellite, with both sides splitting the cost.
The DGT, which holds a telecommunications monopoly here, has budgeted
107.5 million dollars for the project, which would provide 12
transponders for lease to the private and public sectors, including
cable television and radio stations.
The investment will cover the satellite purchase, launch and insurance,
as well as ground control costs.
