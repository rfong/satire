A case in point is Toys ``R'' Us, which decided to develop its own
building after a six-month search turned up no available structures
large enough to meet its needs. Last month the company broke ground for
a 766,000-square-foot, 233-acre distribution center in Mount Olive, the
largest of the current projects. Two Toys ``R'' Us centers now in the
Newark area will relocate there by the middle of next year.
``Now we can expand with our needs and never have to move again,'' said
Michael Paul Miller, the company's senior vice president. ``Owning the
building provides more flexibility and a fixed cost.''
At the International Trade Center, a 670-acre business park in Mount
Olive, the steel frame is rising for a 310,000-square-foot, $25 million
addition for Calvin Klein Cosmetics, the Manhattan-based company. It
will adjoin the company's 142,500-square-foot distribution center and
have more than 80,000 square feet of offices as well as warehouse and
production space. Additional operations now in Wayne will be moved into
the new space, which is expected to be ready by February.
The Calvin Klein operation is in the Foreign Trade Zone of the center,
whose tenants pay reduced or deferred duties, or none at all, on goods
they import or export (duty is paid if the product enters domestic
commerce). Leases at the International Trade Center -- the entire
center, not just the 300-acre trade zone -- typically run 15 years at
rents up to $1 over the $4.50-a-square-foot average, depending on the
use of the building and the tenant's requirements, said Leslie E. Smith
Jr., executive director at the center.
Smith, who is developing the center with the Rockefeller Group, said he
expected to announce another large build-to-suit deal in 30 days. Of
the roughly 6.5 million square feet of office and industrial space
planned for the center, 3 million has already been built, he said.
Work is also proceeding on a 523,000-square-foot distribution center
for Cosmair Inc. of Manhattan at the 500-acre Forsgate Corporate Center
in South Brunswick. The cost of the project, including land, is about
$20 million; it is being financed initially by its developer, the
Forsgate Industrial Complex, which is seeking a lender.
Cosmair will lease the building for 10 to 15 years for its L'Oreal
hair-care division, which will move there from South Brunswick, Clark
and Chicago. Starting rent for the building, which is to be completed
by year's end, will be $4.60 a square foot.
``The move is a way to control the layout of the new building,'' said
Ed Dudzinski, president of Atlantic Realty Services of Warren, which
represented Cosmair in the transaction. He said Cosmair would use a new
material handling system to improve the movement of goods at the
building.
Another factor, he said, is Forsgate's location. The park is in the
area around Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike, long a magnet for such
development. Key reasons for the area's appeal are that it has
available land zoned to meet the needs of large users and is an hour
from New York or Philadelphia via the turnpike and Routes 1 and 130,
linking it to other points along the Eastern Seaboard.
Charles Klatskin, general managing partner of Forsgate Industrial
Complex, said a 120,000-square-foot speculative building at the park
had recently been leased by Crate &AMP; Barrel, the home furnishings
retailer, for a distribution center to serve stores in Short Hills,
Manhattan and Philadelphia. An additional 250,000 square feet is under
construction, he added, noting that just 1.5 million square feet of a
total of 5.1 million remains to be built at Forsgate.
At Center Point, a 900-acre business park straddling Monroe and South
Brunswick Townships, also in the 8A region, construction has begun on a
250,000-square-foot building on 23 acres for W.W. Grainger Inc. The
company, based in Skokie Ill., will own the land and the structure,
which could be expanded to 375,000 square feet.
A 146,000-square-foot addition on seven adjacent acres that are to be
bought is also planned. The development is being done by the developers
of Center Point, a partnership of the Matrix Development Corp. of
Cranbury and the Taylor Simpson Group, a Manhattan real estate
investment firm.
``Such build-to-suit projects are a logical step for us,'' said Alec
Taylor, vice president at Matrix. He said that the 4 million square
feet -- of an eventual 9 million -- that had been built at the center
were fully occupied and renting at an average of $4.25 a square foot.
The initial phase of the Grainger building, to be completed by year's
end, will serve as a zone distribution center for storing, packing and
shipping for the company's more than 50 branch locations on the East
Coast.
Taylor said his company was also seeking approvals for a
300,000-square-foot build-to-suit distribution center for Barnes &AMP;
Noble Inc. It is also completing approvals on a new park farther south
along the turnpike, at Exit 7A, with up to 4.5 million square feet on
553 acres, he said.
