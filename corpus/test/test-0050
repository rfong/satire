Report: Magistrates Seek Berlusconi's Indictment EDS: UPDATES with more details, background; ADDS prosecutors 
Milan's ``Clean Hands'' prosecutors have asked permission to try former
Premier Silvio Berlusconi on corruption charges involving his media
empire, Italian news agencies reported Saturday night.
There was no immediate confirmation of the reports, RAI state TV said,
and no one could immediately be reached by telephone at Milan's
courthouse, which was closed in the evening.
Ever since he was formally notified in November that he was under
investigation for suspected bribes paid to tax inspectors auditing
parts of his Fininvest empire, Berlusconi has steadfastly denied he did
anything wrong.
The Italian news agency AGI reported that prosecutors want Berlusconi
tried for allegedly bribing officials from Italy's tax police division
in return for favorable audits.
A judge would now have to review prosecutors' findings before ruling
whether or not Berlusconi should stand trial. A decision could come in
weeks or months.
Berlusconi was questioned by the prosecutors in the case in December.
The probe is part of a three-year-old, wider investigation throughout
Italy of suspected corruption involving politicians and business. The
kickback and bribery probes first began in Milan under the code name
``Operation Clean Hands.'' Hundreds of politicians and businessmen were
implicated in the probes.
AGI said the prosecutors want Berlusconi indicted for an alleged bribe
of 330 million lire (drs 200,000) to officials of Italy's tax police
division in return for going easy on three companies when combing their
books.
The news agency identified the companies as Mondadori, a publishing
empire which includes the Italian newsweekly Panorama; Mediolanum, an
insurance company, and Videotime, a video operation.
ANSA, another Italian agency, said the indictment request also accused
Berlusconi of a 50 million-lire (dlrs 30,000) payoff concerning the
inspection of the books of Telpiu, a pay-TV channel in the magnate's
Fininvest media world.
Berlusconi resigned as premier in December after news of the probe as
well as feuding in his conservative coalition and has since been
jockeying for another bid for the premiership as head of his Forza
Italia movement.
Saturday's reports came as he and his allies work feverishly to come up
with a last-minute political deal to head off a voter referendum next
month on media ownership restrictions that could mean the shrinking of
his empire, which now includes Italy's three biggest private TV
channels.
News reports said the prosecutors also were seeking indictment of
several tax police officials as well as other officials in Fininvest,
including the ex-premier's brother, Paolo Berlusconi.
Fininvest offices were closed Saturday night when the reports surfaced.
RAI also reported that the same team of prosecutors who were
investigating Berlusconi and his colleagues were themselves formally
notified Saturday that they are under investigation for allegedly
interfering with the work of Justice Ministry officials sent to check
out accusations -- by Berlusconi and others who have been investigated
in the ``Clean Hands'' probe -- that the prosecutors had abused their
powers.
Among the criticized practices was the so-called ``easy-jailing'' of
suspects -- throwing them in jail without charge until they talked to
prosecutors and implicated other suspects.
