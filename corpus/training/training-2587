Peruvian Exports Down Slightly in First Quarter of 2001 
Peru's exports in the first quarter of this year amounted to 12.65
billion U.S. dollars, down by 0.2 percent compared with the same period
last year, the Economy and Finance Ministry said Thursday.
The ministry said in a report that the fall was mainly due to the lower
sales of traditional products.
However, an increase in non-traditional products sales, including
textiles, chemical, fishing and metal mechanical products, partly
offset the drop of the Andean nation's exports in the Januray-March
period, the report added.
The report also forecast that Peru's exports were expected to grow by
8.1 percent in 2001.
