Court Orders Former Thai Lawmaker Extradited to U.S. AP Photo Available 
The Criminal Court on Monday ordered a former Thai lawmaker extradited
to the United States to stand trial on charges that he smuggled 49 tons
of marijuana.
The court ordered Thanong Siripreechapong detained and set extradition
within 15 days, to give him a chance to appeal.
``I am ready for the appeals court,'' Thanong said as he left the
courtroom for jail.
Thanong, 43, is accused of having made millions of dolllars smuggling
several drug shipments to the U.S. west coast between 1973 and 1987.
More than 10 other defendants have been convicted of drug trafficking
in connection with the cases.
A federal grand jury in San Francisco returned the indictment against
Thanong in 1991.
Thanong's assets in the United States _ a house in Beverly Hills and a
Mercedes Benz that totaled dlrs 1.2 million in value in 1993 _ were
seized under a court order.
The indictment was unsealed in May 1994, and later that year the United
States asked for Thanong's extradition. In January this year, the
Cabinet decided to let the Criminal Court rule on the request.
Thanong was a member of the Parliament with the Chart Thai (Thai
Nation) party until he resigned last year due to the scandal.
The U.S. government has denied visas to two other Chart Thai power
brokers on suspicions of links to drug trafficking.
Thailand is a major transit point for illicit drugs that originate in
the ``Golden Triangle,'' where the borders of Thailand, Laos and Burma
converge.
