Jordan warns Israel campaign in Lebanon endangers peace process 
Jordan warned Israel Tuesday that its military offensive in Lebanon was
endangering the peace process.
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Karim Kabariti met with Prime Minister
Shimon Peres here Tuesday as part of a rapidly intensifying diplomatic
initiative to end the six-day-old war in Lebanon launched by Israel to
halt Hezbollah guerrilla attacks.
Kabariti said he was carrying a message from Jordan's King Hussein, who
on Monday expressed his "deep concern over the negative consequences"
of the fighting in Lebanon.
"We feel, like Mr Peres, that peace is an essential priority but the
current situation is not favorable for peace and I hope that we can
save the peace process," he said.
But Kabariti declined to be drawn into a direct criticism of the
Israeli action.
"I'm not involved in a game of scoring points or laying the blame,
there is a cycle of violence and our aim is to stop it," he said.
Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1994 and Amman remains the
Arab capital with the closest ties to the Jewish state.
