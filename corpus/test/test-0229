World Bank Supports Job Creation Project in Colombia 
The World Bank approved Thursday a loan of 100 million U.S. dollars to
help Colombia create new jobs and thereby mitigate the impact of the
economic crisis on the country's poorest families.
The Community Works and Employment Project is expected to crate some
90,000 full-year jobs providing six hours of work per day, which could
indirectly benefit some 171,000 persons by improving basic public
services and providing opportunities to promote economic recovery, the
bank said.
The three-year program will focus in particular on carrying out
small-scale public works such as minor construction, repairs and
expansion of schools, clinics, health facilities, roads and bridges,
and community centers, as well as pilot housing projects.
In addition to reducing unemployment, the project also will have major
benefits for the neediest communities by improving the infrastructure
of basic services, the bank said.
The project will be based on a participatory and decentralized
approach, with the federal government, local authorities, non-
governmental organizations, and community organizations participating
in its implementation.
The Community Works and Employment Project is part of the Colombian
government's strategy to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis and
fiscal adjustment measures on the poorest population through the social
safety net system, which includes creating temporary employment, a
program to assist families in the greatest need, and vocational
training.
