Hainan Puts Agricultural Information on Internet 
Hainan, China's southernmost island province, has set up an
agricultural information homepage on the Internet recently.
Zhou Dawei, secretary-general of the Hainan Provincial Association For
Agricultural Exchanges, said that market information is very important
to Hainan, as most of its agricultural markets lie outside the island.
Wang said that his association plans to cooperate with enterprises in
setting up an information network for China's tropical agriculture.
