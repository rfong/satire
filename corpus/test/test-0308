Plane Crash Kills Four in Canada 
A regional commuter plane crashed in central Canada Tuesday, killing
four people and injuring 13 others, reports said Wednesday.
Three of the dead were killed in the crash, while a boy died hours
later in a Winnipeg hospital.
The plane crashed about 100 meters off the end of the runway at about
3:30 p.m. local time while trying to land in "icy, misty" weather.
There were two pilots and 15 passengers on board when the accident
happened.
Three of the survivors, two middle-aged men and a five-year old boy,
were critically injured.
The military sent a Hercules aircraft from Winnipeg, capital of
Manitoba province, to the crash site, a small Indian community called
Little Rapid Rapids, which is about 300 kilometers northeast of
Winnipeg.
But it couldn't land because the airstrip there was too small.
About five hours later, a small plane owned by the same commuter
company, managed to take off with the three seriously injured aboard.
Yet, it was too late for the small boy, the reports said.
The plane that crashed was an EMB 110, a twin-engine turb-prop regional
commuter with a capacity of 19 people. It was built in 1982 by Brazil.
The same kind of plane has crashed in Nigeria, Guatemala and England.
