Cipollini Wins Third Stage, Rominger Retains Pink Jersey
Mario Cipollini sprinted ahead of the pack on Monday to capture the
third stage of the Tour of Italy cycling race _ his second victory in
three days and his 11th this season.
Swiss Tony Rominger finished in the same time as the winner and
retained the pink jersey of overall leader, conquered in Sunday's
against-the-clock stage at Assisi.
Cipollini, the Italian ``king of sprints'' and winner of the opening
stage of the Giro on Saturday, completed the 161-kilometer distance
from Spoleto to Marotta in three hours, 56 minutes, 11 seconds at an
average speed of 40.900 kph. (pv)
