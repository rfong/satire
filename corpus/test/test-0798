Belgium Unchanged for Davis Cup Encounter with France 
Belgium kept the four players who won them a place in next week's Davis
Cup world group first round when they named their team on Tuesday.
Belgium are to play France in Gent on February 9-11.
Filip Dewulf joins the Rochus brothers, Olivier and Christophe, and Tom
Van Houdt in the Belgian squad. That's the same line-up that beat Italy
4-1 in a qualifier last July.
France earlier selected Australian Open finalist Arnaud Clement,
Sebastien Grosjean, Cedric Pioline and Fabrice Santoro.
The winners will meet either Switzerland or the United States in the
second round.
