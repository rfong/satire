Yeltsin Tells Army Brass to Shape Up, Predicts Cooler Relations 
President Boris Yeltsin warned his armed forces Monday to expect cooler
relations with the United States following sweeping Republican
victories in the U.S. elections.
``After the conservative victory ... the United States can be expected
to get somewhat tougher on foreign policy and on military issues,''
Yeltsin told his commanders.
Many Washington analysts agree, saying a Republican-run Congress could
mean closer scrutiny of foreign aid and treaties with Russia -- and
more defense spending at a time when Russia's own armed forces are in
disarray.
``We need to improve our contacts with the Republicans in order to keep
our relations on an even keel,'' Yeltsin said in his first public
comment on the elections.
His remarks to the military's annual planning session were reported by
the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies. Several top officials
accompanied Yeltsin, underlining the importance of the meeting.
Russia's military is undergoing perhaps its deepest crisis since the
1991 Soviet collapse.
It has had to accept deep budget cuts and humiliating withdrawals from
Eastern Europe and the Baltics. It is accused of widespread corruption
and blamed for the bombing death of an investigative reporter.
Chiding the army brass for sloppy discipline and poor combat readiness,
Yeltsin made it clear he thinks internal problems are distracting the
armed forces from its real mission.
He said scandals and infighting have tarnished the image of the armed
forces and scolded his generals for failing to ``carry out my orders to
tighten military discipline, law and order.''
The end of the Cold War, Yeltsin reminded his commanders, does not mean
a world at peace, and the army must keep in fighting trim.
``There are still political, economic, territorial and religious
conflicts in the world. New weapons are still being produced,'' he
said.
``This means current military conflicts could expand and new ones could
emerge. And Russia, with its geopolitical and geostrategic interests,
may be involved in some of them.''
Yeltsin has declared that Russia -- which already has thousands of
troops in hot spots like Tajikistan, Georgia and Moldova -- has a right
to police the former Soviet Union.
It is a stance that alarms those in the West, including many American
conservatives, who believe Russia harbors imperial ambitions.
Yeltsin also told the army brass that Russia's nuclear weapons are
still a ``nuclear shield, a reliable deterrent,'' but he warned of the
``real possibility that Third World countries could get nuclear
weapons.''
``The end of the Cold War, the cutbacks in nuclear and conventional
weapons means there is less of a threat of a world war being
unleashed,'' Yeltsin said, but ``this doesn't mean the threat of war
has been taken off the agenda.''
