UAE to Have New Patrol Boats
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is to have six new Ocean Capable Patrol
Boats (OCPB) to strengthen its fleet in the Gulf, UAE's official newspaper
Emirates News said today
The vessels, estimated to cost around 600 million U.S. dollars are to
replace the UAE Navy's aging fleet of six 33.5-meter Ardhana class
patrol craft supplied by Vosper Thornycroft of the Britain, said the
newspaper.
Seven international shipyards mainly from Germany, France, Britain and
the United states have been asked to submit technical and commercial
bids for the vessels, said the paper.
The 65-meter-long vessels will be able to accommodate a small size
Eurocopter helicopter and to deploy a Super-Puma helicopter on the
deck, the paper quoted a defense source, who required not to be
identified, as saying.
It was expected that the boats will enhance the UAE Navy's capability
of surface surveillance and interdiction missions and will also enable
the UAE to counter a perceived threat from Iran's acquisition of two
kilo-class submarines from Russia last year, the paper said.
