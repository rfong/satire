Italy Offers Aid to Ethiopia 
Italy has pledged to grant three billion liras (about 1.7 million U.S.
dollars) to Ethiopia to help the country overcome food shortage, the
Italian embassy announced here Wednesday.
In its press statement, the embassy said the Italian government has
also decided to give one billion liras (about 560,000 U.S. dollars) in
relief assistance to the people who became displaced as a result of
15-month Ethio- Eritrea war.
The composition of the aid will be defined in consultation with the
Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission, which is coordinating
emergency relief operations in the country, the statement said.
Besides, the Italian embassy also announced that its government would
grant 1.6 million liras (about 890,000 U.S. dollars) to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in support the Somali and
Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia.
The Ethiopian food crisis emerged from March of this year following
months of drought in many parts of the country.
It was reported that in some parts of Ethiopia, river beds, which
normally can only be crossed by boat in June, became completely dry,
and were being used by children as make-shift football pitches.
As most crops have been impossible to grow, some villages were
reportedly deserted by their inhabitants as they search for food.
As the number of people affected by the drought rises up to 4.6
million, different countries, including the United States, Holland,
Canada, Japan and China, have made donations to the Horn of Africa
country in the past few months.
