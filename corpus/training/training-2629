Poland pays tribute to filmmaker 
Each Polish daily devoted its front page Thursday to the death of
Krzysztof Kieslowski, many quoting his French producer Marin Karmitz
who called him the greatest film director in Poland, if not Europe.
Not only the media was talking about Kieslowski, who directed the
acclaimed trilogy "Three Colours" -- "Red," "White" and "Blue" and "The
Double Life of Veronique," as well as "Decalog," a series of 10
hour-long films originally made for television.
On Thursday, taxi drivers, grocery clerks and the owner of a hair salon
in central Warsaw lamented the 54-year-old's death Wednesday of a heart
attack following a bypass operation Tuesday.
"Drunks live to 90, and an exceptional man like Kieslowski dies at 54,"
said one labourer. "That's not fair."
Warsaw's main daily newspaper, the left-wing Gazeta Wyborcza, said that
the director's death came as a shock. "Critics compared him to
Antonioni or Bergman... Most of his friends said they were incapable of
writing an obituary for him."
Film critic Tadeusz Sobolewski wrote in Gazeta that "a force emanated
from him, a force that only certain artists -- and certain priests --
possess."
The liberal daily Rzeczpospolita called Kieslowski "one of the most
eminent Polish filmmakers, a creator whose films influenced European
culture."
