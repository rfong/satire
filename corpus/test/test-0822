Bank of England Urges Higher Rates to Curb Inflation 
Britain's central bank warned today that the government might not be
able to keep the inflation under control if interest rates were not
raised as soon as possible.
The Bank of England said in its quarterly inflation report that the
base lending rate, now standing at 6.75 percent, must go up as
inflationary pressure is gathering strength.
"Delay in taking action could ultimately result in interest rates
having to go higher than would otherwise be the case," the report said.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke has been resisting the
advice by the Governor of Bank of England Eddie George on interest
rates hike, fearing the economic slowdown could dump the political
future of the ruling Conservative Party.
The government has said it wants the underlying inflation, that
excluding home loans interest payment, to be in the lower half of the
1-4 percent target, namely 2.5 percent.
But the Bank's projection showed that underlying inflation would rise
above 2.5 percent in two years' time if the interest rates are not
raised soon.
On Tuesday, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) said in its annual survey of Britain's ecomony that interest
rates might need to rise to 7.75 percent, a full percentage point above
the present rate, in order to keep the underlying inflation within the
target range of 1-2.5 percent at the end of the current parliament
until 1997.
The OECD predicted that Britain's economy will expand by 3.4 percent in
1995 and 3 percent in 1996.
