US agents question al-Qaeda prisoners in Pakistan
US agents are questioning al-Qaeda members who have been detained in
Pakistan about the worldwide activities of the terror group, a senior
security official said Saturday.
"A 10-member US team is interrogating members of al-Qaeda group lodged
in the prison," the Pakistani official told AFP on condition of
anonymity from the northern town of Kohat.
"Only the Americans are conducting the interrogation and we have no
access to their findings," he said.
The prisoners include some Europeans of Arab origin but the official
said he did not know their exact numbers.
Dawn newspaper said the US team questioning the 139 members of Osama
bin Laden's organisation is from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It said two French Muslims were among the detainees at the prison in
North-West Frontier province.
"The prison is being strongly guarded by the police while the army is
maintaining security inside. Anti-aircraft guns have also been
installed as a precautionary measure," the official said.
The newspaper said the detainees, who were captured after fleeing
neighbouring Afghanistan, had told interrogators that bin Laden and
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar were still alive and inside
Afghanistan.
"They will be the only source to tell the Americans what plans Osama
bin Laden had in his mind before and after the September 11 attacks,"
it quoted a source as saying.
The prisoners also reportedly told the FBI team that some 6,000-7,000
al-Qaeda members were still inside Afghanistan or along the border with
Pakistan.
Washington accuses bin Laden of masterminding the suicide airliner
attacks in New York and Washington which killed more than 3,000 people.
Earlier this month FBI agents arrived in the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar to question al-Qaeda and Taliban members being held by
American forces there.
The US has said it wants to question al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters
detained in Pakistan, which has deployed thousands of troops along its
border to catch fugitives from Afghanistan.
Afghanistan's Taliban regime sheltered bin Laden for five years until
it was toppled from its last stronghold this month by US-backed Afghan
opposition fighters.
In a separate report Dawn said two US helicopters and a plane carrying
about 25 Marines landed Thursday night at Dera Ismail Khan airport,
further to the south of North West Frontier Province.
It said local troops blocked access to the airport as the troops
landed.
The paper quoted sources as saying the Marines are believed headed for
border tribal areas amid speculation bin Laden may be hiding out there.
