Quake Island Victims Buried in Mass Grave 
About 150 people, many of them weeping and shouting loved ones' names,
on Thursday buried 23 victims of a devastating earthquake and tidal
wave in a mass grave.
In a driving rain, the mourners drove from the mortuary, where two
Roman Catholic priests said Mass in a garage, to the public cemetery
two kilometers (over one mile) away.
``You should have saved yourself,'' shouted Purina Rosales, alternately
embracing the coffins of her husband, Eduardo, and her 4-year-old
daughter, Elaisa. ``What will happen to me now.''
Then 22 coffins were lowered into the meter (3-foot)-deep mass grave in
the cemetery, located in what was once the town's garbage dump. Two of
the dead, a brother and sister, shared one coffin.
Separate funerals were planned for two other victims in Malaylay, the
hardest-hit village.
In all, the quake and tidal wave killed at least 67 people, mostly on
Mindoro Island, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Manila.
Another 248 people were injured and about nine were missing.
Earlier, during the funeral Mass, one mourner in a black dress fainted
as the priests were blessing the plywood coffins.
``It would have been better if we had all died,'' wailed Felicidad
Altea after she was revived. Mrs. Altea lost three nieces and a brother
in Tuesday's disaster. Another 30 of her relatives were injured and
five others, including nephews and grandchildren, were missing.
In Malaylay, only two of the 34 houses remained. In other Mindoro
neighborhoods, the earthquake and tidal wave destroyed 870 houses and
damaged 3,640 others, said Rodolfo Valencia, one of the two governors
on Mindoro Island.
Valencia said 54 bridges in his province were either damaged or
destroyed.
One of the priests, the Rev. Ed Fabella, who lives elsewhere in the
town of which Malaylay is a part, said, ``When the earthquake struck, I
fell on the floor. Then I heard a loud roar which sounded like rain but
there was no rain.
``It was only in the morning when I went to Malaylay that I saw the
death and destruction there.''
President Fidel Ramos, who was in Indonesia for an Asian economic
summit meeting, cut short his visit by a day.
Arriving Thursday in the southern city of Davao, en route to the
stricken area, Ramos said, ``I shall hasten to reach Mindoro Oriental
to personally commiserate with the affected families and to enhance the
effort of the various government agencies in emergency, rescue, relief
and rehabilitation.''
He said he had authorized the released of 50 million pesos (dlrs 2.08
million) for use in the affected areas. He also said Filipinos in
Indonesia collected 350,000 pesos (dlrs 14,583) in donations when they
heard about the Mindoro tragedy.
The local government is helping villagers by giving 10,000 pesos (dlrs
416) for each family member killed and 5,000 pesos (dlrs 208) for those
injured.
More than 1,448 aftershocks jarred Mindoro Tuesday and Wednesday,
scientists reported.
The earthquake cut off electricity to most of Mindoro and destroyed
many of its water mains.
The quake, with a magnitude of 7.1, was centered six miles (10
kilometers) north of the island. A magnitude of 7 indicates a major
quake capable of widespread, heavy damage.
The Philippines, a Pacific archipelago of 7,100 mountainous islands,
sits on at least four major faults. An earthquake in 1990 killed nearly
2,000 people on Luzon Island.
