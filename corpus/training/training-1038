Israeli soldiers shoot dead Palestinian on West Bank 
Israeli soldiers shot dead a 50-year-old Palestinian man near the
occupied West Bank town of Ramallah on Thursday, military officials
said.
Soldiers at a checkpoint opened fire on Hassan Amer's car "for reasons
yet to be clarified," officials said.
Amer, from annexed East Jerusalem, was driving Palestinians from the
Israeli settlement of Givat Har Adar where they worked to their home
village of Biddu.
The shooting raises to 59 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli
soldiers since Palestinian self-rule was launched in Gaza and Jericho
in May, according to an AFP toll compiled from military and Palestinian
sources.
