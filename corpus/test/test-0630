Indian Airlines world's sixth most accident-prone: 
The International Air Transporters' Association (IATA) has rated
India's state-run domestic carrier the world's sixth most
accident-prone airline, a parliamentarian claimed Friday.
Parag Chaliha of the regional Asom Gana Parisad party told parliament
that although Indian Airlines did not accept IATA's rating as valid,
the government should improve safety standards of the domestic carrier.
The IATA has included Air Lanka, Pakistan International Airlines and
Indian Airlines among the most accident-prone services.
The state-run Indian Airlines, which daily flies 31,000 passengers to
26 domestic and 10 international destinations, has suffered 16 crashes
since its inception in the 1950s.
