US, NKorean negotiators to hold nuclear talks in Beijing 
US and North Korean negotiators will begin a second round of talks here
Wednesday on implementing their landmark nuclear accord signed last
month, diplomats here said.
The US team, headed by the state department's deputy director for
non-proliferation Gary Samore, was scheduled to arrive in Beijing late
Tuesday, a US embassy spokesman said.
"The two sides will hold preliminary discussions on light water reactor
projects, and the talks will last for three days," the spokesman said.
Under the accord, the United States pledged to replace North Korea's
graphite-moderated reactors, which produce weapons-grade plutonium,
with light-water reactors financed by an international consortium.
The two sides have already held an intitial round of talks in Pyongyang
earlier this month.
According to a North Korean embassy spokesman, the latest round of
discussions will begin Wednesday morning in the North Korean mission
here.
The spokesman declined to specify who would head the North Korean
negotiating team.
