Hungarian output rises 3.7 percent in 3rd quarter 
Hungary's gross domestic product grew by 3.7 percent in the third
quarter of 2001 from the figure for the same period last year, the
Central Statistical Bureau said on Thursday.
In the second quarter of the year, the GDP was up four percent from the
same period last year. "This relatively slower growth, compared to last
year's, is primarily connected to industry output," the bureau said.
The service sector grew most in the third quarter of this year -- by
about four percent -- while growth in industry and the agriculture fell
back by more than 50 percent, to some 2.5 percent, the bureau added.
