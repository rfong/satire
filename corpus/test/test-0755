Roger Federer refuses to play tennis until named most handsome man on tour
The controversy over who is the best looking male tennis player in the
world heated up to a new level today. In a hastily convened press
conference Roger Federer announced that he was effectively going on
strike until he was named the best looking player on the Men's tour.
"It's quite simple " he told this website "I want an end to this
nonsense over whether I am good looking or not."
Federer has said that he will not play another game until he gets a
definitive statement from the tennis authorities that he is the best
looking male player in the world today.
Federer has demanded that the International Tennis Federation, the
world governing body of tennis, organise a poll on a global scale that
demonstrates he is not only the top seed but also top stud.
"For goodness sake, I am a Gillette pin up - why won't people just
appreciate that I am good looking and let me get on with my tennis. All
I am asking is that the ITF run a poll which proves how damn gorgeous I
am. Then I can get back to being a sponsor's dream on the court."
Other players have yet to comment on this bizarre set of events -
although Andy Murray was seen attending a sun-bed emporium. Meanwhile
the ITF has yet to decide how it will react to this news.
