Israeli/NNP Scientist/NNP Invents/NNP New/NNP Method/NNP to/TO Diagnose/VB An/DT Israeli/JJ scientist/NN has/VBZ invented/VBN a/DT new/JJ method/NN to/TO distinguish/VB between/IN malignant/JJ and/CC benign/JJ tumors/NNS that/WDT may/MD also/RB help/VB establish/VB the/DT prognosis/NN of/IN cancer/NN and/CC monitor/VB therapy/NN 's/POS effectiveness/NN ./.

The/DT non-invasive/JJ method/NN was/VBD developed/VBN by/IN Professor/NNP Hadassa/NNP Degani/NNP from/IN the/DT Weizman/NNP Institute/NNP ,/, the/DT July/NNP issue/NN of/IN the/DT Nature/NNP Medicine/NNP magzine/NN published/JJ today/NN reported/VBD in/IN its/PRP$ cover/NN story/NN ./.

The/DT method/NN consists/VBZ of/IN injecting/VBG a/DT contrast-enhancing/JJ dye-like/JJ material/NN into/IN the/DT patient/NN 's/POS bloodstream/NN and/CC using/VBG magnetic/JJ resonance/NN imaging/NN -LRB-/-LRB- MRI/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- to/TO follow/VB the/DT way/NN this/DT material/NN is/VBZ absorbed/VBN and/CC evacuated/VBN by/IN the/DT tumor/NN ./.

Because/IN the/DT uptake/NN and/CC clearance/NN differ/VBP in/IN cancerous/JJ and/CC benign/JJ tumors/NNS ,/, such/JJ monitoring/NN makes/VBZ a/DT diagnosis/NN possible/JJ ./.

A/DT computer/NN shows/VBZ an/DT image/NN on/IN a/DT screen/NN in/IN various/JJ colors/NNS ,/, reflecting/VBG the/DT distribution/NN of/IN the/DT contrast/NN material/NN ./.

The/DT color/JJ patterns/NNS for/IN malignant/JJ and/CC benign/JJ growths/NNS are/VBP strikingly/RB different/JJ ,/, Degani/NNP said/VBD ./.

She/PRP added/VBD that/IN the/DT method/NN thus/RB could/MD reduce/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN biopsis/NNS performed/VBN to/TO diagnose/VB tumors/NNS ./.

``/`` Most/JJS breast/NN tumors/NNS detected/VBD by/IN mammography/NN prove/VBP to/TO be/VB benign/JJ in/IN a/DT biopsy/NN ,/, so/CC that/IN a/DT non-invasive/JJ method/NN like/IN MRI/NNP could/MD help/VB reduce/VB the/DT rate/NN of/IN unnecessary/JJ procedures/NNS ,/, ''/'' Degani/NNP said/VBD ./.

The/DT method/NN could/MD also/RB tell/VB doctors/NNS the/DT prognosis/NN of/IN cancer/NN because/IN it/PRP reveals/VBZ tiny/JJ blood/NN vessels/NNS that/WDT feed/VBP the/DT cancer/NN -LRB-/-LRB- in/IN a/DT process/NN called/VBN angiogenesis/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC allow/VB the/DT tumor/NN to/TO grow/VB and/CC spread/VB ./.

Knowing/VBG their/PRP$ density/NN and/CC ability/NN to/TO deliver/VB materials/NNS to/TO the/DT tumor/NN may/MD make/VB it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO determine/VB the/DT tumor/NN 's/POS potential/JJ aggressiveness/NN ,/, said/VBD Degani/NNP ./.

Monitoring/VBG the/DT blood/NN vessels/NNS and/CC the/DT spaces/NNS between/IN cells/NNS may/MD also/RB help/VB evaluate/VB the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN treatment/NN ./.

A/DT reduction/NN in/IN the/DT vessel/NN 's/POS density/NN and/CC an/DT increase/NN in/IN intra-cellular/JJ spaces/NNS could/MD point/VB to/TO successful/JJ therapy/NN ,/, She/PRP added/VBD ./.

In/IN conventional/JJ MRI/NNP ,/, signals/NNS emanating/VBG from/IN the/DT nuclei/NNS of/IN hydrogen/NN atoms/NNS that/WDT make/VBP up/RP water/NN in/IN the/DT tissues/NNS are/VBP too/RB weak/JJ to/TO produce/VB a/DT resolution/NN comparable/JJ to/TO that/DT under/IN a/DT microscope/NN ./.

But/CC in/IN Degani/NNP 's/POS method/NN ,/, resolution/NN is/VBZ very/RB high/JJ because/IN the/DT water-tissue/JJ signals/NNS are/VBP recorded/VBN over/IN an/DT extended/JJ period/NN -/: two/CD to/TO four/CD minutes/NNS instead/RB of/IN the/DT usual/JJ several/JJ seconds/NNS ,/, the/DT report/NN said/VBD ./.
