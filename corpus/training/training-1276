Clinton to Meet Martin Luther King Jr.'s Family 
U.S. President Bill Clinton will meet with the family of Martin Luther
King Jr. but is reserving judgment on whether there should be a new
investigation into the civil rights leader's assassination, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said Monday.
Clinton will meet at the White House Tuesday with King's widow, Coretta
Scott King, and three of their children to hear the family's concerns,
McCurry said.
Tuesday's meeting is a follow-up to a telephone call Clinton had with
the family earlier this year, and an April meeting between Coretta and
Attorney General Janet Reno. That meeting was scheduled after she asked
to see the president regarding new information on her husband's death.
The King family, along with other civil rights leaders, have requested
that Clinton form a federal commission to look into King's
assassination.
McCurry said Clinton asked Reno to pursue the family's request "as a
matter of courtesy and out of respect for the legacy of Dr. King," but
would withhold any decisions on their demand for a commission until the
Justice Department finishes its review.
King was gunned down on April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of
a Memphis, Tennessee, hotel. James Earl Ray confessed to shooting King,
pleaded guilty and was given a 99-year prison sentence in 1969.
Ray recanted three days after his sentencing and sought to go to trial.
He never got that trial, and died of liver failure in April at age 70.
An investigation by the House of Representatives concluded in 1978 that
Ray shot King but that others also may have been involved.
King's son, Dexter, met with Ray in March 1997 and said he believed Ray
was innocent.
