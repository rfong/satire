Stocks rally after consumer price report 
Blue-chip stocks rallied Tuesday after the government reported a
continued low rate of inflation at the consumer level for August,
easing jitters over interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 19.52 points to close at
3,879.86.
Some 293 million shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
On the bond market, the average interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds
dropped to 7.68 percent from 7.71 percent on Monday.
The drop followed a report showing that retail prices rose a modest 0.3
percent in August, easing fears that the Federal Reserve would be
forced to boost short-term interest rates later this month to keep
inflation in check.
Fears of accelerating inflation had depressed stocks over the previous
two trading sessions after a report Friday showing wholesale prices up
0.6 percent in August.
IBM rose 1-3/8 to 69-1/4 after announcing the introduction of six new
