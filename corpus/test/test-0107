PLO says it received only quarter of aid pledged by donors 
The Palestinian Authority has only received a quarter of the aid
pledged by international donors in 1994, Palestinian economy minister
Ahmad Korei said Tuesday.
"Of the 800 million dollars pledged by donor countries last year we
have only received 215 million dollars," said Korei, quoted by the
official Egyptian news agency MENA.
He said 124 million dollars was allocated for the self-rule authority's
administration costs and nearly 90 million for infrastructure projects.
Korei said he hoped the rest of the aid would be released at a meeting
of donor countries in Paris at the end of April.
Officials from more than 30 countries which have provided aid for the
autonomous Gaza Strip met in Gaza last month to check how the funds
were being used, ahead of a conference on regional economic development
in Paris on April 24.
Palestinian self-rule was launched in Gaza and the Jericho enclave on
the West Bank last May.
