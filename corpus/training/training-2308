Norwegian government to propose increase in value-added tax 
The Norwegian government is to propose a one-percent increase in
value-added tax in next year's budget, hiking the rate from 22 to 23
percent, Social Democrat Party leader Thorbjoern Jagland said Tuesday.
The proposal will be contained in the 1995 budget to be put to
parliament next week.
The increase aims to compensate for losses likely to be suffered by
Norwegian farmers and middle-scale firms if the country votes in a
referendum on November 28 to join the European Union.
If Norway joins the union as of January 1, food prices will likely fall
by between 10 and 20 percent and the government will earn less from
taxes on alcohol sales, Jagland said.
