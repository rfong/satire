Malaysia seals pact to develop city-over-river project
Malaysia's government Tuesday signed a multi-billion-dollar pact to
develop a 12-kilometre-long (seven-mile-long) self-contained city over
a Kuala Lumpur river despite public opposition.
The government awarded developer KL Linear City Sdn. Bhd. 216.5 acres
(87.69 hectares) of land along the Klang river in the heart of the
capital for 611 million ringgit (244 million dollars) on a 99-year
lease.
It also signed a 30-year concession agreement with KL PRT Sdn. Bhd., a
unit of the developer, to develop, operate and maintain a monorail
system within the city.
The KL Linear City project is expected to be gradually implemented over
a 20-to-25 year period while a "people-mover rapid transit" (PRT)
system is scheduled to be fully operational by 2000, company officials
said.
The Kuala Lumpur Linear City project comprises several buildings,
including the multi-level Giga World, spanning the river. The Giga
World is the main feature of the project, stretching 2.4 kilometres
(1.5 miles).
All these buildings will be propped up by pillars driven into the banks
of the river. Apartments and condominiums will also be built along the
river banks.
"It (Giga World) will be the largest and longest shopping complex in
the world," David Chew, the managing director of KL Linear City, told
reporters after the signing, witnessed by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
KL Linear City, 51-percent owned by ethnic Malays, is closely linked to
business tycoon Vincent Tan, while KL PRT is its 63 percent-owned unit
with the remaining 37 percent held by KL Monorail Concessionaire Sdn.
Bhd.
The development of the KL Linear City is to cost up to 10 billion
ringgit while the construction of the monorail system is valued at 2.2
billion ringgit.
Chew said work on the PRT system, linear city and Giga World will start
as soon as final approvals were received from the authorities.
The first stage will be the PRT system, to be constructed after 1,000
squatters living along the river bank have been resettled, he said.
Chew said the linear city project is expected to be financed from a mix
of shareholders' equity and commercial debt financing.
"Provisions are being made to tap public financing via initial public
offering as an infrastructre privatisation project," said Chew.
The linear city project will comprise retail, offices, hotels, service
apartments, restaurants, education and exhibition centres.
Mahathir said at the signing he was impressed with the project,
describing it as "sophisticated and extraordinary".
