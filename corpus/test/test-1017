But Palestinian leaders said the fighting reflected widespread Palestinian
frustration and anger over the deadlock in the Palestinian self-rule
process since Netanyahu came to office at the head of a right-wing
government in June.
On Friday the mass circulation daily Yediot Aharonot described a
"crisis of confidence" it said had developed between Netanyahu and army
top brass.
It said Netanyahu accused army officials of being too closely aligned
to the peace policies of the previous Labor government while the
defense establishment says his refusal to implement self-rule
agreements with Palestinians was undermining Israeli security.
Defense officials were notably alarmed by the fact Netanyahu did not
inform them of plans to open a new entrance to an archaeological tunnel
near Islamic holy sites in annexed east Jerusalem.
The opening of the entrance last month sparked last month's
Israeli-Palestinian violence.
