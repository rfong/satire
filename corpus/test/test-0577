Tamil Tigers: the tail that bleeds Sri Lanka
When government troops captured the Tamil Tigers' citadel of Jaffna,
Sri Lanka celebrated it as a fatal blow to the rebels. But seven months
later, the guerrillas are fighting back with a vengeance.
Sri Lanka has remained soaked in blood and tears since the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) carried out its first major attack against
security forces in July 1983, killing 13 troopers and sparking ethnic
violence.
Tiger supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran, then aged 18, founded the
separatist organisation in 1972 as the Tamil New Tigers and four years
later changed its name to the four-letter acronym, the LTTE.
There has been no turning back since then. To his admirers, Prabhakaran
is a charismatic folk hero fighting for minority Tamil rights but to
most Sri Lankans he is a ruthless warlord responsible for the deaths of
50,000 people.
The Tigers owe their success mainly to an elite unit known as Black
Tigers who carry out suicide bombings. The list of their victims has
been growing frighteningly long since the first attack nine years ago.
Prabhakaran has supper with Black Tigers and poses for a picture before
sending them on their missions. It is the suicide attacks, often
carried out with deadly accuracy, that have made the Tigers legendary.
"Black Tigers are the self-protective armour of our race," Prabhakaran
said over his clandestine radio last month. "They are the men of flame
who can destroy the enemy's armed strength by their brain strength."
From a band of just a dozen gunmen, the LTTE has today grown to an
estimated 8,000 to 10,000 highly dedicated guerrillas who wear cyanide
capsules around their necks to commit suicide if faced with the threat
of arrest.
However, in the face of a major military offensive begun in October
last year, the Tigers melted away from the northern peninsula of Jaffna
where they had maintained a de facto state called Eelam for nearly five
years.
The military said the successful battle for Jaffna shattered the LTTE's
invincibility. Most Tamils who fled the fighting returned home despite
Tiger threats, evidence at last of civilian defiance of the rebels.
But the euphoria evaporated fast. The Tigers may have lost their "head"
in Jaffna but the "tail" proved just as strong, if not more ruthless,
stinging like a bunch of mad bees.
Deputy defence minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told parliament last week
that the separatist war was no longer confined to the island's
Northeast where the minority Tamils are concentrated.
