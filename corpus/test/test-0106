Cesium detected 70 kilometers away from Japanese nuke accident site 
A small amount of radioactive cesium was detected some 70 kilometers
(43 miles) away from a Japanese nuclear plant where 37 workers were
exposed to low-level of radiation in an accident last week, the
meteorological agency said Tuesday.
A small amount of cesium-134 and cesium-137 was found in air samples
taken between March 10-12 above the agency's institute in Tsukuba,
north of Tokyo, an official at the institue said.
"We suspect a link between the cesium and the accident," the official
said, adding that added that the amount was "very small" and would not
affect humans.
Radioactive leakage was detected after a fire and explosion at a
nuclear reprocessing plant in Tokai Mura, about 115 kilometers (70
miles) northeast of Tokyo, on March 11.
The government has recognised it as Japan's worst nuclear accident.
The meteorological agency official said it would continue monitoring
the air above Tsukuba while analysing the latest data.
The Asahi Shimbun, quoting agency officials, said the reading in
Tsukuba is several tens of times the level of cesium-137 that would
typically be measured in the aftermath of a nuclear test conducted
abroad.
The amount of cesium-137 was measured at 84-millionths of a becquerel
per cubic meter. After the disastrous Chernobyl nuclear power plant
accident in 1986 in Ukraine the readings were 61,000 millionths of a
becquerel per cubic meter.
