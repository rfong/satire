A major earthquake struck a sparsely populated region in the Russian
Far East on Saturday, officials said. No casualties or damage were
immediately reported.
The quake measured 7.5 in magnitude and occurred near the town of Okha
on Sakhalin Island, said Eduard Kozhukhov, a Moscow-based spokesman for
Russia's Ministry for Emergency Situations. He said there was no
apparent damage or casualties but had no further details.
The earthquake was confirmed by the U.S. Geological Survey's National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo, which put the magnitude
at 7.6. Waverly Person, a geophysicist for the center, said the temblor
occurred at 11:04 p.m. local time (1304 GMT) with an epicenter in a
remote region 110 kilometers (75 miles) south of Okha.
Sakhalin Island is located more than 6,500 kilometers (4,000 miles)
east of Moscow and north of the Japanese island of Hokkaido, on the Sea
of Okhotsk.
A temblor measuring magnitude 7 or greater is considered a major quake,
capable of widespread, heavy damage.
