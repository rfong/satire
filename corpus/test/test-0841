Amnesty urges clemency in Friday execution 
Amnesty International Thursday issued a last-minute appeal to Singapore
President Ong Teng Cheong for clemency for a young Portuguese woman due
to be executed on Friday for drug smuggling.
Angel Mou Puipeng, 25, a native of Macau residing in Hong Kong, was
arrested in Singapore's Changi Airport in August 1991 in possession of
5.6 kilograms (12.32 pounds) of heroin.
She was convicted of drug smuggling in April 1993 and sentenced to
death.
Puipeng said at her trial that she had been recruited and paid as a
courier by a Triad member to carry a parcel from Thailand to Europe,
but said she believed she was carrying wrist watches.
Her recruiter, identified in court as Ah Hung, was sentenced in Hong
Kong to four years in prison for "acts...preparatory to trafficking."
Amnesty said Puipeng had been scheduled to be executed on December 23,
but was granted a reprieve to spend the holidays with her family,
including her nine-year-old son.
The London-based rights group said the relatively light sentence given
to the Hong Kong drug dealer "illustrates the disparity between
sentencing for drugs-related crimes between countries.
"The organizer of a drugs ring receives four years...and a young
courier receives the death penalty..."
