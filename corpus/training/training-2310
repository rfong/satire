Nigerian magistrate murdered
The chief magistrate of Calabar, the capital of Nigeria's southern,
oil-rich Cross River State, has been hacked to death in her home in what
could be a revenge killing, police said on Wednesday.
Maria Theresa Nsa's mutilated body was found on Tuesday a few hours
after she denied murder suspects bail, a police spokesman told AFP.
"We cannot rule out a political motive for her assassination. She gave
a ruling about some notorious criminals and a few hours later, she was
dead," he said.
The slain magistrate had ordered that key suspects in last year's
murder of a council chief be remanded in prison pending the outcome of
the trial.
The chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) in the state, Joe
Agi, called for an official investigation into her killing.
"The police should leave no stone unturned to get the culprits," he
said.
He said the NBA will also set up an independent inquiry into the
murder.
