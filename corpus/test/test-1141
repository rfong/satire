631 Local Governments Getting Funds to Help Hire Almost 4,700 New 
Federal money is going to 631 local governments to help them hire
nearly 4,700 new police officers they requested under the crime law
enacted this year, President Clinton says.
Grants totaling $231.7 million will go to 167 municipal and county
police departments and county sheriff's offices with populations of
150,000 and over. A total of $95.4 million will go to 464 jurisdictions
with populations under 150,000.
Puerto Rico will receive almost $7.83 million to hire and train 276
officers. The U.S. Virgin Islands were not on the list to receive
police money, said Justice Department spokesman Kevin Avery. He did not
know if they requested funds.
``We have now put about 10,000 of our 100,000 police officers in
process to be on the street and we're going to keep going until it's
all done,'' Clinton said Monday at a Justice Department ceremony.
The program, called ``Cops Ahead,'' is the second under the $30 billion
crime legislation that included $8.8 billion for the police program.
The Justice Department made 392 awards in October for the hiring or
rehiring of additional officers. A third announcement of 5,000 more
police officers is expected early next year.
Clinton coupled his announcement of the awards with naming Joseph E.
Brann, chief of police in Hayward, Calif., to direct the
administration's police-hiring program. He said Brann will be America's
``top cop.''
Attorney General Janet Reno swore Brann in as his wife and children
held the Bible for the oath.
Reno referred to critics of the crime law, passed in August, who said
the number of police to be put on the streets would be nowhere near
what the administration promised.
``Today we answer those critics, not with talk, but with action,'' she
said.
The administration released a list of 631 cities and counties that have
been given the go-ahead to begin hiring up to 4,688 new officers while
their grant petitions are pending.
The list is headed by Chicago, which will get 321 more police at a cost
of $24 million. Philadelphia will get 153 and Detroit nearly 100. The
list includes smaller cities such as Encinitas, Calif., population
56,064, which gets one through a $75,000 grant.
Under the law, the jurisdiction must hire the authorized officers,
enroll them in the first available training classes in 1995, and
complete applications by March 3. The money will be sent either when
the application is approved or new officers are sworn in.
