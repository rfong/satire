Yeltsin to meet Turkmenistan president Tuesday 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin is due to meet the visiting president
of Turkmenistan here on Tuesday, his first meeting with a foreign
leader in over a month, the Interfax news agency reported.
Monday's report did not specify a venue for the scheduled meeting with
Turkmen leader Saparmurat Niazov.
The ailing Yeltsin is under strict medical supervision at a rest home
in the Moscow suburbs in preparation for major heart surgery next
month.
It will be the Russian president's first meeting with a foreign leader
since his talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl near Moscow on
September 7.
Niazov held talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin shortly after
his arrival in Moscow on Monday.
The two men discussed the situation in Afghanistan and repayment of
Russia's 500-million dollar arrears for supplies of Turkmen natural
gas, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
The Kremlin announced last week that Yeltsin would meet Belarussian
President Alexander Lukashenko on Wednesday.
