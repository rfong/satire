EU Condemns Recent Killing in Cyprus 
The European Union (EU) today strongly condemned the killing by
soldiers of the forces in the north of Cyprus of an unarmed Greek
Cypriot civilian three days ago in the zone within which Turkish and
Turkish Cypriot forces operate.
The EU said in a statement that it deplored this latest tragic death,
as it did all the violent deaths which had occurred recently in Cyprus.
It declared that the EU fully endorsed the principle stated by the U.N.
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus that deadly force must not be used by
either side against persons who cross the respective cease-fire lines,
or enter the U.N. buffer zone.
It called on both sides to look urgently at measures aimed at removing
live ammunition from front line posts and increasing the area of
demanning as called for in U.N. Security Council resolutions.
"These events only underline the need to redouble efforts to seek
progress on dialogue between both communities," the statement said.
The EU also stated that it would encourage and promote efforts aimed at
an early resumption of dialogue between both communities, with the
objective of achieving a comprehensive political settlement to the
Cyprus question, under the aegis of the United Nations.
