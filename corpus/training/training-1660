No Special Visas From Spain: Cuban Foreign Ministry 
Cuba's Foreign Ministry denied today that the Spanish consulate in
Havana is to grant special visas or process them at a faster rate for
Cubans trying to leave the country.
The ministry made the announcement at the request of the Spanish
diplomatic mission in the capital in the wake of a row between the two
countries over comments made by Spanish diplomats about the political
situation in Cuba.
"At the request of the kingdom of Spain, the Cuban Foreign Ministry
informed the people of Cuba that the Spanish embassy will continue to
offer services to the public as usual and without change," said a
ministry statement.
Several hundred people gathered around the embassy building on Tuesday
after rumors that special visas would be granted or issued quickly by
the Spanish embassy without having to go through the normal procedures.
This followed comments made to a Spanish newspaper by Spain's new
ambassador to Cuba, Jose Coderch Planas, that his embassy's door would
be open to "dissidents" whom he would help in any way he could.
Cuba has been angered by Coderch's comments and earlier this week
revoked its approval for the new ambassador to take up his post in
Havana. It accused him of interfering in its internal affairs and
breaching the 1961 Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations.
The row over Coderch's comments fueled a diplomatic spat that started
in early November after Spain's Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said on
Spanish television that his government's policy was to lend support to
what it called a "peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba."
The Foreign Ministry has accused Spain of becoming a spearhead for U.S.
interests against the Caribbean nation. The U.S., which has operated an
international economic embargo against Cuba for the last 36 years,
tightened sanctions in March this year after the downing of two
civilian U.S. planes allegedly over Cuban waters.
