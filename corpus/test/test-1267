German plant and machinery orders rise in December 
Orders placed with German makers of plant and machinery rose in
December, with strong overseas demand offsetting a sharp drop in
domestic orders, data published by the VDMA industry association showed
on Thursday.
Orders for German-made plant and machinery rose by one percent in
December on a 12-month basis, VDMA said in a statement.
Foreign orders rose by 20 percent, while domestic orders declined by 25
percent.
Following a 20-percent slump in plant and machinery orders in November,
the rise in December was "good news, but it does not yet signify a
turnaround," said a VDMA official, Olaf Wortmann.
The monthly data tended to be volatile, since they could easily be
distorted by big, individual orders, he cautioned.
Using a three-month comparison to iron out short-term fluctuations,
orders in the period from October to December fell by nine percent from
the year-earlier figure, with domestic orders falling by 14 percent and
foreign orders sliding six percent, VDMA said.
And looking at 2001 as a whole, full-year orders fell by seven percent
from the figure for 2000.
