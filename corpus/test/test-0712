Major in Vilnius for talks with Baltic leaders 
British Prime Minister John Major arrived here Tuesday to meet with his
Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian counterparts for talks expected to
focus on trade and Baltic-Russian relations.
"This visit has economic meaning for us but also political meaning,"
said Vilius Kavaliauskas, spokesman for Lithuanian Prime Minister
Adolfas Slezevicius.
Major was expected to discuss the politically-sensitive subject of
Russian troop withdrawals from the former Soviet Baltic republics,
Kavaliauskas said.
"Our neighbours need support on the withdrawal of troops," he said.
Major was due to hold a news conference starting 2:00 p.m. (1100 GMT).
Britain is the biggest investor in Lithuania and Slezevicius hoped
Major's visit will encourage British firms to participate in several
substantial projects including the conversion of military factories to
civilian production, Kavaliauskas said.
During his one-day visit to the Lithuanian capital, Major was also
scheduled to meet with Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas and the
prime ministers of Estonia and Latvia, Mart Laar and Valis Birkavs,
respectively.
The last Russian troops left Lithuania last year and Moscow has pledged
to withdraw its soldiers from Estonia and Latvia by August 31.
