Leeson claims London boss pleaded: boost your profits to save our bonuses 
Rogue trader Nick Leeson said his boss at Barings in London called him
in late 1994 to plead for bigger profits, so that everyone's bonuses
could be paid that year, in an extract of his autobiography published
here Thursday.
The 28-year-old, who brought Britain's oldest merchant bank to its
knees after amassing losses of 1.5 billion dollars through risky
futures trades, said that Ron Baker, the head of derivatives at
Barings, phoned late one night to push for more profits.
"We need another two million pound profit before the end of the month
to secure our bonuses. You've got to do it, Nick. There's no room for
failure," Baker told Leeson according to the extract from the book
"Rogue Trader," published in the Daily Mail.
But the Barings executive also warned the trader, who in 1993
contributed 10 percent of Barings' total profits, that the bank's top
management were worried about his risky dealing on the market.
"The old farts want you to begin to unwind your position a little.
They're worried about the levels of funding needed to keep it going,"
Baker told Leeson over the phone.
Shortly before the bank collapsed in February 1995, Barings in London
allegedly transferred millions of pounds to cover losses on positions
taken by Leeson, despite warnings to top executives and in alleged
breach of bank regulations.
In other passages from "Rogue Trader," which Leeson wrote in a German
prison while awaiting extradition for trial on fraud charges in
Singapore, and to be published February 23, he describes the high life
he and his fellow derivatives traders revelled in.
"And so we filed into the Singapore exchange each morning, each of us
earning perhaps 200,000 pounds a year, wealthy beyond the dreams of
most of the rest of the world, and we started buying and selling
numbers," he says.
Leeson was jailed last year in Singapore for 6-1/2 years on fraud
charges resulting from his activities.
