Government holds coup meeting, troops surround general's house
The Cambodian coalition government Wednesday held an emergency meeting
of top officials to discuss a possible crackdown after last weekend's
thwarted coup, a senior official said.
As the meeting began, troops surrounded the house of General Sar
Moline, a former deputy to ex-interior minister Sin Song, who was
implicated in the failed coup, the source said, without elaborating.
The meeting, presided by co-premiers Hun Sun and Prince Norodom
Ranarridh, included the ministers of the defence and the interior, as
well as high-ranking officers from the military and security apparatus,
he said.
"The plan of the meeting is to investigate and arrest other people who
may have been involved in the coup. We do not know who, but it must be
some high-ranking officials," he said.
The government last Saturday blocked an attempted coup by 200 armed
soldiers whose suspected leaders were Prince Chakrapong, a vice premier
in the former Vietnam-backed government in Phnom Penh, who is a
half-brother of Prince Ranariddh, and Sin Song.
Fourteen Thais were detained in connection with the abortive coup. Sin
Song was arrested, but Prince Chakrapong was allowed to leave for
Malaysia on Sunday following an appeal from his father, King Norodom
Sihanouk.
Meanwhile, the far-left Khmer Rouge guerrillas Wednesday accused the
government of plotting the coup as a pretext for declaring "martial
law."
The climate of tension, they said in a radio broadcast monitored in
Bangkok, would pressure members of the cabinet and parliament to vote
for a "fascist law" banning the Khmer Rouge.
Parliament reconvened in Phnom Penh Wednesday to debate a bill that
would formally outlaw the ultra-nationalist faction, which has been
fighting a hit-and-run campaign against the government that emerged
from the 1993 UN-organised elections in Cambodai.
