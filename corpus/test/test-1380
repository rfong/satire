Thorpe Has Hat Trick in Swimming World Cup 
World champion Ian Thorpe of Australia had a hat trick at a World Cup
swimming tournament in Sheffield, England, Wednesday.
The 17-year-old, who won the 100 and 400 meters freestyle Tuesday, swam
away with the gold in the 200m freestyle in one minute and 44.82
seconds Wednesday evening.
Thorpe's gold treble was trumped by South African Terence Parkin and
Slovakia's Martina Moravcova, who both won four events in the two-day
meeting at the Ponds Forge pool, the eighth leg in the 12-stop World
Cup short-course series.
Parkin, a deaf swimmer who relies on a flash in a lamp at the base of
his starting block to get the start, added the 100 breaststroke and 200
meters individual medley to the 400 individual medley and 200
breaststroke golds he won Tuesday as well as a silver in the 50
breaststroke.
His victim in the 200 individual medley was Britain's James Hickman,
who had suffered his first 200 butterfly short-course reverse in three
years Tuesday when he was pipped by American Olympic silver medalist
Tom Malchow.
But Hickman, who won Tuesday's 100 meters individual medley, picked up
a second win Wednesday, celebrating his 24th birthday with a
comprehensive victory in the 100 meters butterfly, which he won by
nearly two seconds from German veteran Christian Keller.
Moravcova, a triple short-course world champion who won Tuesday 's 200
freestyle and 200 individual medley, followed up with wins in the 100
freestyle and 100 individual medley, each time beating top Briton Sue
Rolph into second place.
