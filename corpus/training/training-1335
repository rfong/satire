Platform For Action: Girl Child 
The Platform for Action adopted here today by the UN Fourth World
Conference on Women appeals for immediate measures by all governments
to eliminate all kinds of discrimination against girl children and
violation of their rights.
The 150-page official document dedicates five pages to address gild
child issues.
It sets forth nine strategic goals for this purpose, including ending
all forms of discrimination against girl children, eliminating negative
cultural attitude and actions against them, abolishing discrimination
against them on education, technological development, health care,
nutrition and other aspects, and stopping any violence against them.
The UN official document requests governments of all nations to develop
and implement comprehensive policies, plans of action and programs for
the girl children's survival, protection, development and advancement,
eliminate the injustice and obstacles in relation to inheritance faced
by the girl child and ensure equal right to inherit, regardless of the
sex of the child.
It also says that governments should enact laws concerning the minimum
legal age of consent and the minimum age for marriage and raise the
minimum age for marriage where necessary.
Governments should ensure universal and equal access to and completion
of primary education by all children and eliminate the existing gap
between girls and boys.
The document asks all governments, international and non-governmental
organizations to provide public information concerning the removal of
discriminatory practices against girls in food allocation, nutrition
and access to health services, and take all measures to abolish
traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children.
It also requires governments to protect children from economic
exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to harm or to
interfere with their education, health or their physical, mental,
spiritual, moral or social development.
