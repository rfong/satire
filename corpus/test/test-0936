Shanghai to Hold International Flower Festival 
China's leading industrial and commercial city of Shanghai is scheduled
to hold its second international flower festival next spring.
The festival, in the theme of "Flowers And Environment For Mankind",
will display more than 1,000 kinds of flowers and plants from some 100
countries.
Flower traders from over 20 countries and regions, including some 300
Chinese companies, have registered for the event.
The flower festival was initiated in 1998 and is held once every two
years.
Currently, a one-month-long flower festival is in progress in
neighboring Zhejiang Province.
