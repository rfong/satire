Major Reassures Unionists on Ulster's Future 
British Prime Minister John Major tried again today to improve
relations with the unionists in Northern Ireland in a bid to ensure
that the peace process would not be torpedoed, according to reports
here.
In talks with leaders of the unionist community in Northern Ireland,
this morning, John Major tried to convince the unionists that he was
not intending to impose on them a blue-print for the future of the
troubled province.
Meanwhile, British Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew held talks with
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring in Belfast this afternoon to
continue the discussion on the framework document which will serve as a
basis for the multi-party negotiations on the final settlement of
Northern Ireland.
Dick Spring said that the framewrk document was almost concluded and it
could be finalized today.
Spring did not disclose the content of the document, but he stressed:
"It will be balanced document", challenging to both nationalists who
desire for the reunification of the whole island of Ireland and
unionists who firmly defend British rule over Northern Ireland.
Spring said that he hoped that the framework document would bring both
the nationalist and the unionist communities to the negotiating table.
It is observed that Spring's hope would not be so easily be
materialized, because the key point is whether the document would
satisfy the two communities together.
On February 1, the Times newspaper frontpaged a report saying that the
framework document brings the prospect of a united Ireland closer than
ever since partition of the island of Ireland in 1920.
The report says the proposals in the document include a joint
north-south Irish authority with radical executive powers, even
including the right to deal with the European Commission.
This report enraged the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the largest
political party of the unionist community in Northern Ireland.
The UUP which enjoys nine seats in parliament has repeatedly threatened
to withdraw its support for the government. According to recent reports
from Dublin and here, the UUP and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP),
another political party of the unionist community, would set up a
united front to veto the document.
