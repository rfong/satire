Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo on Wall Street Decline 
Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo Thursday, hit by overnight declines on
Wall Street and confusion in the U.S. presidential election.
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First Section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 339.59 points, or 2.21 percent, from
Wednesday's close to end at 15,060.05.
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all First
Section issues, fell 26.19 points, or 1.80 percent, to 1,427. 45.
Turnover on the major section decreased to 486.47 million shares from
Wednesday's 581.73 million shares.
Trading was sluggish throughout the day, with investors jittery over
the outcome of one of the closest presidential races in U.S. history,
traders said.
Nissan Motor was the day's volume leader.
Stocks were mostly lower across the board. Of the 33 business
categories, only the rubber and fishery sectors rose on average,
traders said.
High-priced issues were also lower, largely contributing to the key
indexes' falls, they said.
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers overwhelmed gainers
989 to 275, with 135 issues closing unchanged.
