Lazio fans invade training camp in derby protest as Roma rejoice
Around 400 Lazio fans invaded the Italian first division club's Formello
training ground Tuesday to protest the club's 5-1 defeat by AS Roma in the
city derby at the weekend.
Once the fans had breached the perimeter they headed towards the
players who ran away and sought refuge in the gymnasium.
Lazio skipper Alessandro Nesta, substituted at half-time during the
derby after making defensive mistakes that contributed to all three
goals by Roma's Vincenzo Montella before the break, went to pacify the
fans.
Nesta, a popular figure at the club despite his trio of clangers on
Sunday, spoke to supporters and made amends for the errors during
Sunday's match.
After an hour the team again ventured out but there were repeated
chants by fans for coach Alberto Zaccheroni to resign.
As Lazio fans fumed thousands of Romanis 15,000 by organisers and 5,000
by police met at the Circus Maximus - the scene of chariot races during
the days of the Empire - before moving on to the Colosseum.
The Roma fans did not spare the feelings of their rivals with 22 live
chickens wearing bows in the sky blue colours of Lazio while a Lazio
jersey with the name of Argentinian striker Hernan Crespo was ritually
burned.
Many fans wore club colours but others donned the garb of Imperial Rome
with togas and laurel wreaths much in evidence. j1 Last summer when
Roma won their first Scudetto in 18 years some 1.5 million Romanistas
thronged the Circus Maximus for the victory party.
