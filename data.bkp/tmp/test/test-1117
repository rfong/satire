Kohl/NNP Unveils/NNP Four-Year/NNP Program/NNP ,/, Hopes/IN His/PRP$ Government/NN Lasts/NNP Chancellor/NNP Helmut/NNP Kohl/NNP promised/VBD Monday/NNP to/TO trim/VB the/DT bloated/JJ bureaucracy/NN and/CC give/VB more/JJR rights/NNS to/TO foreigners/NNS during/IN his/PRP$ new/JJ four-year/JJ term/NN ./.

But/CC critics/NNS said/VBD Kohl/NNP 's/POS ideas/NNS are/VBP hot/JJ air/NN ./.

Kohl/NNP unveiled/VBD a/DT 49-page/JJ legislative/JJ blueprint/NN entitled/VBN ``/`` Making/VBG United/NNP Germany/NNP Fit/NNP For/IN The/DT Future/NNP ./. ''/''

The/DT document/NN says/VBZ the/DT federal/JJ bureaucracy/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ about/RB 90,000/CD workers/NNS ,/, must/MD be/VB slimmed/VBN down/RP so/IN the/DT government/NN has/VBZ more/JJR money/NN to/TO spend/VB on/IN the/DT reconstruction/NN of/IN former/JJ East/NNP Germany/NNP ./.

It/PRP calls/VBZ for/IN further/JJ welfare/NN cuts/NNS for/IN the/DT same/JJ reason/NN ,/, and/CC financial/JJ incentives/NNS to/TO encourage/VB German/JJ companies/NNS to/TO be/VB more/RBR inventive/JJ ./.

Kohl/NNP told/VBD reporters/NNS :/: ``/`` In/IN the/DT coming/JJ years/NNS we/PRP have/VBP to/TO renew/VB the/DT economy/NN and/CC society/NN of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Republic/NNP of/IN Germany/NNP ./. ''/''

Rudolf/NNP Scharping/NNP ,/, who/WP lost/VBD to/TO Kohl/NNP in/IN the/DT Oct./NNP 16/CD election/NN and/CC is/VBZ head/NN of/IN the/DT opposition/NN Social/NNP Democrats/NNPS ,/, said/VBD there/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN new/JJ in/IN the/DT document/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD written/VBN by/IN the/DT three/CD parties/NNS in/IN Kohl/NNP 's/POS coalition/NN government/NN ./.

``/`` There/EX 's/VBZ not/RB a/DT single/JJ concrete/JJ answer/NN to/TO this/DT country/NN 's/POS main/JJ challenges/NNS of/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, ''/'' Scharping/NNP said/VBD ./.

Scharping/NN said/VBD Kohl/NNP is/VBZ avoiding/VBG real/JJ issues/NNS to/TO keep/VB his/PRP$ government/NN ,/, weakened/VBN by/IN the/DT Oct./NNP 16/CD election/NN ,/, from/IN collapsing/VBG ./.

Kohl/NNP 's/POS majority/NN fell/VBD from/IN 134/CD to/TO 10/CD parliamentary/JJ seats/NNS in/IN the/DT federal/JJ election/NN and/CC he/PRP will/MD probably/RB have/VB to/TO steer/VB a/DT cautious/JJ course/NN over/IN the/DT next/JJ four/CD years/NNS ./.

The/DT legislative/JJ document/NN proposes/VBZ dual/JJ citizenship/NN for/IN some/DT foreigners/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT restrictions/NNS were/VBD immediately/RB criticized/VBN as/IN too/RB harsh/JJ ./.

Germany/NNP 's/POS 1913/CD citizenship/NN laws/NNS let/VBD foreigners/NNS have/VBP a/DT German/JJ passport/NN if/IN they/PRP can/MD prove/VB they/PRP have/VB German/JJ blood/NN ./.

But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ far/RB more/RBR difficult/JJ for/IN others/NNS to/TO get/VB citizenship/NN ./.

Since/IN neo-Nazi/JJ attacks/NNS against/IN foreigners/NNS started/VBD four/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN calls/NNS for/IN granting/VBG dual/JJ citizenship/NN to/TO ease/VB the/DT integration/NN of/IN non-Germans/NNS ./.

A/DT plan/NN announced/VBN by/IN Kohl/NNP would/MD created/VBN a/DT ``/`` children/NNS 's/POS nationality/NN ./. ''/''

This/DT would/MD let/VB certain/JJ foreigners/NNS have/VB dual/JJ citizenship/NN until/IN they/PRP reach/VBP age/NN 18/CD ,/, when/WRB they/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO give/VB up/RP citizenship/NN in/IN their/PRP$ home/NN country/NN if/IN they/PRP want/VBP to/TO keep/VB their/PRP$ German/JJ passports/NNS ./.

Young/NNP foreigners/NNS would/MD only/RB qualify/VB for/IN German/JJ citizenship/NN if/IN their/PRP$ parents/NNS have/VBP lived/VBN in/IN Germany/NNP for/IN 10/CD years/NNS ,/, and/CC one/CD of/IN the/DT parents/NNS was/VBD born/VBN in/IN Germany/NNP ./.

Faruk/NNP Sen/NNP ,/, director/NN of/IN the/DT Center/NNP for/IN Turkish/JJ Studies/NNS in/IN Essen/NNP ,/, said/VBD the/DT proposal/NN would/MD do/VB little/RB for/IN the/DT integration/NN of/IN Germany/NNP 's/POS 6.9/CD million/CD foreigners/NNS ./.

Of/IN the/DT 2/CD million/CD Turks/NNPS living/VBG in/IN Germany/NNP ,/, only/RB about/RB 9,000/CD would/MD qualify/VB for/IN citizenship/NN under/IN the/DT coalition/NN 's/POS proposal/NN ,/, Sen/NNP said/VBD ./.

Kohl/NNP 's/POS coalition/NN faces/VBZ its/PRP$ first/JJ post-election/JJ test/NN on/IN Tuesday/NNP when/WRB the/DT lower/JJR house/NN of/IN parliament/NN ,/, called/VBN the/DT Bundestag/NN ,/, is/VBZ to/TO formally/RB vote/VB on/IN his/PRP$ appointment/NN as/IN chancellor/NN ./.

Kohl/NNP refused/VBD to/TO say/VB whom/WP he/PRP will/MD name/VB to/TO his/PRP$ new/JJ Cabinet/NN ./.

German/JJ media/NNS say/VBP Kohl/NNP worries/VBZ that/IN parliamentarians/NNS within/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ coalition/NN could/MD vote/VB against/IN him/PRP Tuesday/NNP if/IN they/PRP are/VBP displeased/JJ with/IN his/PRP$ Cabinet/NNP choices/NNS ./.
