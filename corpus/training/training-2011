Singapore's SEMPEC buys majority stake in Chinese engineering firm 
Singapore's Sembawang Projects Engineering Co. Pte. Ltd. (SEMPEC) has
bought a majority stake in a Beijing-based engineering firm to
undertake projects in China and elsewhere, company officials said
Thursday.
SEMPEC, which bought 51 percent of Hua Yang Engineering and Technology
Corp., has also set up a joint-venture company with China HuanQiu
Chemical Engineering Corp. (HQCEC), which holds the remaining 49
percent.
SEMPEC did not disclose the investment value of the stake which it
bought from Formosa Plastics USA.
The new joint-venture company, Sembawang HuanQiu Engineering
Corporation, was inaugurated Wednesday, officials said.
It will undertake engineering, procurement and construction work in
China as well as offering engineering design for SEMPEC's contracts in
other countries.
"The new partnership will spearhead SEMPEC's business interests in
engineering and construction of chemical process plants in China," said
Cheong Quee Wah, chairman and president of Sembawang Engineering Group.
SEMPEC is a subsidiary of Sembawang Engineering Pte. Ltd. and part of
listed Sembawang Corporation Ltd..
Its joint-venture partner, HQCEC, is a state-run international
engineering corporation staffed by 1,000 engineers.
SEMPEC and HQCEC had previously worked together on a chemical plant in
Indonesia.
