Lonely Duhalde lobbies for Argentine lawmakers' support in radio address 
President Eduardo Duhalde found himself alone Saturday, struggling to
return Argentina to the international financial system after Congress
failed to back controversial changes to a law as requested by the IMF.
"Alone, without help, it is very difficult to move this country out of
crisis and I was not elected to help it sink," Duhalde announced to
Argentines in his Saturday radio broadcast.
"So what I need from politicians is get Argentina back into the world."
Argentina's lower house of parliament narrowly rejected a government
proposal Friday to modify the "economic subversion law" -- one of the
conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for a renewal of aid
to Argentina, whose economy has been shrinking for nearly four years.
Duhalde's Peronist party lost by just three votes (99-102) in its bid
to change the controversial law, which criminalizes bad business
decisions and capital flight.
Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna returned from a visit to the
International Monetary Fund this week "hopeful and pleased, because if
Argentine fulfills the 14 points agreed by provincial governors, we
will find a quick solution to our problems," Duhalde said.
However, only eight of a total 24 electoral districts have signed on to
an agreement to slash federal spending by 60 percent as required by the
IMF, although the dissenting Buenos Aires city government finally
signed Saturday.
Some 350,000 to 500,000 public employees would be laid off by such
cuts, increasing the political difficulty of cuts now that half of
Argentina's 36 million citizens have fallen below the poverty line --
in a country that was once Latin America's richest.
Duhalde highlighted Saturday the human cost by blaming the economic
crisis for the deaths of seven newborns, which he linked to the state
of malnutrition in the northern province of Tucuman, where infant
mortality due to the economic crisis has risen to 22.6 per thousand.
