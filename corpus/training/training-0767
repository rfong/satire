Alan Ball/Boris Yeltsin Funerals Mix-up
There was confusion today on both sides of the Iron Curtain over the
funerals of ex-Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and former England
World Cup winner Alan Ball, who is dead.
In a hitherto unprecedented mix-up of superhuman proportions, Mr
Yeltsin was buried on Blackpool beach, whilst the squeaky-voiced
ginger-haired midfield dynamo found himself laid to rest in the
desolate Novodevichy cemetery in Moscow.
It's thought by senior executives at the English Football Association,
that the British and Soviet governments are 'in cahoots', and may have
come to some 'secret arrangement', although officials from both
countries have denied that the tiny Mr Ball was a mole.
Mr Yeltsin, it has emerged, was the famous 'Russian linesman' in the
1966 World Cup Final, and it is thought that Ball may have been the
unfortunate victim of an unlikely 'exchange deal'.
Ball, who was the first player on Earth to wear white boots, started
his playing career at Blackpool before enjoying stints at Everton,
Arsenal, Southampton and in the US.
He died on Tuesday from a heart attack after tackling a bonfire in his
garden.
Former England team-mate Sir Geoff Hurts, said:
"He was never afraid of tackling anybody."
Commenting on the bizarre burial mix-up, Ball's former manager, the
bizarrely-named Lawrie McMenenenememey, now a nobody, said:
"It's just like Bally. He was always out of position."
