Sudan Agrees to Extradite Hijackers to Ethiopia 
At the request of the Ethiopian government, Sudan has agreed to
extradite those accused of hijacking an Ethiopian airliner last month,
Sudanese newspaper Al-Inqath Al-Watani reported today.
The report quoted Sudanese Justice Minister Abdul-Aziz Sakudou as
saying that Sudan decided to extradite the five Ethiopians after the
relevant investigations had been completed.
On Sunday, Ethiopia officially requested Khartoum to extradite the
hijackers, whose ages range from 18 to 23.
The five Ethiopians hijacked an Ethiopian airliner last month when it
was on a domestic flight from Addis Ababa to the city of Bahrdar.
The hijacked airliner landed at Al-Obeid airport of Sudan after the
captain had convinced the hijackers that it would be impossible for the
plane to fly to Sweden without being refueled. After negotiations, the
hijackers surrendered to Sudanese authorities.
