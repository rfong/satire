Burns takes Rally lead as top contenders fall 
Richard Burns of Mitsubishi Ralliart took the lead on the second leg of
the 3,800-kilometre (2,280-mile) 555 Hong Kong to Beijing Rally on
Sunday, with two top contenders forced to retire after their cars went
into a ditch.
Former leader Piero Liatti, winner of the day's first stage, ran wide
in his Subaru around a left-hand bend near the end of the third stage
and rolled down a four-metre (12-foot) ditch.
"I was in sixth gear over a small jump and into a left-hand bend," said
Liatti. "The car ran wide and the road fell away from me."
After Group N driver Michael Lieu drove into the same ditch, his car
coming to rest three metres (10 feet) from Liatti's, organizers halted
the stage.
Both cars were towed away. Both drivers and their co-drivers were
uninjured.
Competitors unable to complete the third stage were given assessed
times.
Burns, who was second behind Liatti in Sunday's first stage, won both
the second and third stages.
In Sunday's fourth stage, Burns was four seconds off the pace set by
Kenneth Eriksson and Ari Vatanen.
On Monday, the remaining 45 competitors move northwards to Hunan
province for the third leg being run over four stages totalling 71
kilometres.
Burns will start the leg with a 30-second lead over teammate Vatanen
and a one-minute 36-second lead over Liatti teammate, Eriksson.
