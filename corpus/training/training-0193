Bill Clinton's Blog
The former Arkansas governor and U.S. president, is seeking the
distinction of first male First Lady. Bill oversaw two terms in the 90s
at a time of enormous economic prosperity and White House promiscuity.
The saxophonist and cigar aficionado now presides over the William J.
Clinton Foundation, raising money for charitable causes around the
world. It's widely believed that his successor, George W. Bush, has
unintentionally guaranteed Clinton's legacy through contrast.
Who do you want answering the phone?
By Bill Clinton
The national question is who do we want answering the phone at 3:00 AM?
Personally, I think people will just be relieved that it's someone who
speaks in the right end. But I do have experience with one of the
candidates 3 in the morning phone etiquette.
The phone would ring and I'd try to answer it, but Hillary would grab
it first. "Hello. Oh hello Boris how are you? Good, can you put Naina
on the phone. Oh c'mon put Naina on the phone. Hello Naina. I saw your
picture in the Times. Was that Ralph Lauren? No, I loved it. Oh I saw
it and had to have it. Chelsea? Oh she's good. She's taking AP Latin. I
will, I will tell her. That's good. We'll talk soon. Bye Naina."
Then she hung up the phone. When I asked her why Yeltsin called she
said "oh something about invading Chechnya to drive back our forces,
but I'm sure if it was important he'll call back in the morning."
