Channel Four's Documentary "Dying Rooms" Refuted
Two officials from the Los Ninos International Adoption Center in
Texas, the United States, have lodged a protest against Britain's
Channel Four's documentary titled "Secret Asia, the Dying Rooms" in
their letters to China's cultural consul in Houston.
Molan Greenberg, chairman of the adoption center, said in his letter to
counsellor Lin Zuosen, "the portion of Channel Four's film on the one
single case of a child left to die was obtained through an unethical
method (a hidden camera) and Channel Four was unable to present to the
viewers the orphanage's side of the story."
"I, personally and through our adoptive parents, have first-hand
information on the orphanages in China. Los Ninos has helped happy
families adopting nearly 170 Chinese infants and children from
orphanages in Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hebei, Anhui and Guangxi. Our
experiences have been with orphanages operated by devoted staff with
their children receiving proper care," he said
"At Los Nines we strongly support the Chinese government's policy on
International Adoption. Such policy takes full consideration of the
benefit for the children involved. It also promotes harmony and
understanding for a globe that is forever becoming smaller and
inter-dependent," he added.
In his letter, the center's executive director Heino R. Erichsen said,
"I want to express my disgust and opposition to the Channel Four
documentary to appear on CBS August 17, 1995 titled "Secret Asia, the
dying Rooms."
"The title suggests an ardent anti-China policy," he said.
Erichsen has made several trips to China and visited orphanages in many
Chinese provinces.
"Our experiences have been with generally healthy Chinese children," he
said.
