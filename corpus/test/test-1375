CPC Attaches Great Importance to Agriculture, Rural Work
Second, China has obtained great achievements in its reform and opening
up which started in rural areas and spread across the country. So,
summing up the experience in the past two decades is of important
significance for the Party to persist in the policies adopted since the
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC National Congress and to expand
China's reforms and development.
Third, with the current Asian financial crisis and challenges from
economic globablization, agricultural growth, prosperity of rural areas
and the increase of farmers' purchasing power will help expand domestic
demands, keep the momentum for growth of the nation's economy, and
sharpen China's edge in international competition.
China's basic stance is to make an effort to expand the domestic
market, especially the rural market, while making good use of overseas
markets.
Fourth, in the process from getting enough to eat and wear, then
becoming comparatively better-off, and to modernization, there are many
problems in the economic construction, cultural and ethical progress,
legislation, and grass-roots organizations in rural areas.
In some places, the Party's rural policies have not been implemented in
a good way, leading to slow increases in farmers' incomes and adversely
affecting their enthusiasm in farming.
Poor agricultural infrastructure and a limited ability to deal with
natural disasters have been blamed for the greater pressure on the
people, resources and the environment.
And, it is only when these problems are solved that full economic
development and social progress in rural China can be achieved and a
new socialist, wealthy, democratic and civilized countryside built.
