China to Buy U.S. Phosphate Fertilizer
Chinese and American fertilizer companies signed here today an agreement
under which China will buy another half a million metric tons of phosphate
fertilizer from the United States.
The agreement, valued more than 100 million US dollars, was signed by
Steve Hoffman, senior vice president of the Phosphate Chemicals Export
Association(Phosphate), and Shi Xiaoyan, executive vice president of
the China National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation (Sinochem),
on the third day of a purchasing tour by a high-ranking Chinese trade
and economic cooperation delegation.
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Shi described the agreement as
another example of successful cooperation between the two countries.
She thanked her American partners for their efforts to ensure the
extension of the most-favored-nation status for China.
She told those present at the ceremony that China, the largest importer
of fertilizer in the world, buys some three million metric tons of
phosphate fertilizer, or 80 percent of its needs, from the United
States annually.
In reply, Hoffman said leading members in his association will continue
to strengthen friendly relationship with Sinochem not only as a
supplier but also as a partner in increasing the productivity of
China's growing agricultural community.
"We have been privileged to work with the people of Sinochem for
several years, seeking the possibility of launching a joint venture to
produce phosphate fertilizer in southern China," he told Zeng Paiyan,
the head of the Chinese delegation who attended the signing ceremony.
The fertilizer agreement is the second of the six contracts to be
signed this month between the Chinese delegation and U.S. companies.
The first agreement was signed Monday between Atlantic Richfield Corp.
and the China National Offshore Oil Company. The delegation left here
this morning for New York.
