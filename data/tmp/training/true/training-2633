New/NNP Zealand/NNP rise/VBP from/IN the/DT ashes/NNS New/NNP Zealand/NNP shook/VBD off/RP the/DT humiliation/NN of/IN their/PRP$ recent/JJ South/NNP African/NNP tour/NN which/WDT went/VBD up/RP in/IN smoke/NN to/TO humilitate/VB the/DT West/NNP Indies/NNP here/RB on/IN Monday/NNP ./.

Wicketkeeper/NNP Adam/NNP Parore/NNP scored/VBD an/DT unbeaten/JJ maiden/JJ Test/NNP century/NN and/CC fast/JJ bowler/NN Danny/NNP Morrison/NNP took/VBD four/CD for/IN 33/CD ,/, including/VBG the/DT wicket/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN 's/POS best/JJS batsman/NN ,/, Brian/NNP Lara/NNP ,/, for/IN two/CD ./.

The/DT West/NNP Indies/NNP finished/VBD the/DT day/NN on/IN 102/CD for/IN five/CD ,/, needing/VBG another/DT 42/CD runs/NNS to/TO avoid/VB the/DT follow-on/JJ after/IN New/NNP Zealand/NNP had/VBD declared/VBN at/IN 341/CD for/IN eight/CD ./.

However/RB ,/, with/IN two/CD days/NNS lost/VBN to/TO rain/NN the/DT match/NN is/VBZ unlikely/JJ to/TO produce/VB a/DT result/NN although/IN new/JJ coach/NN John/NNP Reid/NNP was/VBD optimistic/JJ ./.

``/`` We/PRP talked/VBD in/IN the/DT dressing/JJ room/NN quite/RB openly/RB before/IN we/PRP went/VBD out/RP to/TO bowl/NN today/NN that/IN only/RB one/CD team/NN could/MD win/VB the/DT Test/NNP match/NN and/CC that/WDT was/VBD us/PRP --/: so/IN we/PRP may/MD as/RB well/RB give/VB it/PRP 100/CD percent/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Reid/NNP who/WP replaced/VBD Geoff/NNP Howarth/NNP in/IN the/DT furore/NN over/IN the/DT cannabis-smoking/NN in/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP ./.

``/`` If/IN we/PRP can/MD bowl/VB them/PRP out/RP for/IN 140/CD or/CC less/JJR they/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO bat/VB again/RB --/: we/PRP could/MD win/VB this/DT Test/NNP match/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP added/VBD ./.

Lara/NNP was/VBD at/IN the/DT crease/NN for/IN only/RB 18/CD minutes/NNS when/WRB Morrison/NNP got/VBD his/PRP$ slower/JJR ball/NN to/TO duck/VB back/RP into/IN the/DT lefthander/NN and/CC the/DT world/NN record/NN Test/NNP scorer/NN got/VBD an/DT inside/JJ edge/NN on/IN to/TO his/PRP$ leg/NN stump/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ to/TO get/VB that/DT little/JJ fella/NN ,/, ''/'' Morrison/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ nice/JJ to/TO outfox/VB a/DT lefthander/NN like/IN that/DT ./.

Morrison/NNP was/VBD also/RB rapt/JJ to/TO have/VB outsmarted/VBN two/CD of/IN the/DT West/JJ Indies/CC better/JJR batsmen/NN --/: Williams/NNP and/CC Jimmy/NNP Adams/NNP --/: with/IN his/PRP$ bouncer/NN ./.

``/`` They/PRP 're/VBP impulsive/JJ and/CC they/PRP 're/VBP bought/VBN up/RP on/IN a/DT diet/NN of/IN quick/JJ bowling/NN in/IN the/DT Caribbean/NNP so/IN they/PRP do/VBP play/NN that/WDT shot/VBD a/DT lot/NN and/CC they/PRP back/VBP themselves/PRP to/TO score/NN from/IN it/PRP ./.

Parore/NNP had/VBD to/TO overcome/VB a/DT fear/NN of/IN the/DT West/NNP Indies/NNP pace/NN attack/NN which/WDT had/VBD ruined/VBN his/PRP$ one-day/JJ series/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT bounce/NN that/IN Walsh/NNP and/CC Ambrose/NNP get/VBP is/VBZ really/RB difficult/JJ to/TO deal/VB with/IN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP explained/VBD ./.

``/`` If/IN you/PRP stand/VBP up/RP and/CC play/VBP you/PRP 'll/MD just/RB get/VB bashed/JJ around/IN the/DT hands/NNS and/CC arms/NNS from/IN the/DT sheer/JJ number/NN of/IN short/JJ balls/NNS you/PRP get/VBP ./. ''/''
