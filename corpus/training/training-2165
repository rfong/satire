Singapore Calls For Wider Cooperation with Malaysia 
Singapore has called for wider cooperation with Malaysia in an attempt
to improve strained bilateral ties, the Straits Times reported today.
The English newspaper quoted Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong as
saying that the two neighboring countries should discard old historical
and emotional baggage and embark on a new era of cooperation.
Giving a 50-minute speech in parliament Thursday, Goh offered a
framework of wider cooperation between the two countries which would
help overcome existing difficulties in their relationship.
The recent dispute between Singapore and Malaysia was sparked by a
court statement by Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, which
refers to Johor, a state in southern Malaysia.
The Malaysian government decided on March 26, 1997 to temporarily
freeze its ties with Singapore and postpone all the ongoing bilateral
talks.
Despite Lee made a public apology for his statement, the Malaysian
government said that bilateral ties could not be improved in a short
period of time.
Goh hoped that Singapore and Malaysia would continue their talks over
mutually beneficial projects, such as a high-speed electric rail link
between the two countries and a long-term water supply deal from
Malaysia to Singapore.
Singapore relies heavily on water from Malaysia and the two agreements
on water supply will expire in 2010 and 2060.
Goh said in his speech that he had explained to his Malaysian
counterpart Mahathir Mohamad that Singapore sought a water agreement
within a wider framework of cooperation.
"If Singapore and Malaysia can embark on a new era of cooperation, we
will signal to the present and future generations that we have
discarded the old historical and emotional baggage in favor of
fruitful, mutually beneficial cooperation ," he said.
