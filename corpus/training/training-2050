Q. Why do swarms of crows sometimes attack lawns?
A. The birds are almost certainly in search of food, said Heidi Hughes,
an ornithologist with the Backyard Bird Society in Rockville, Md. Crows
are opportunistic feeders, she said, and might attack a lawn as a
likely source of nutritious grubs below the grass.
The culprits in lawn attacks are also frequently starlings, Ms. Hughes
said. ``If there is anything good that starlings do, it is attacking
grubs just below the surface of the lawn in the soil,'' she said. The
starling, Sternus vulgaris, is an alien species much despised by
birdwatchers for killing and taking over the nests of domestic
songbirds.
Starlings can be mistaken for crows because they exhibit two plumages:
a greenish, blackish, purplish irridescent one with a yellow bill in
summer, and an irridescent black plumage with white spots on the chest
and a black bill in winter.
The starling can be told from the crow by its shorter tail and browner
wings in flight and by its much smaller size. It is only 6 inches long,
while the most common crow species in North America, the American crow,
is easily twice as big, at 17 inches. The crow also has the distinctive
and familiar cry, ``Caw, caw.''
