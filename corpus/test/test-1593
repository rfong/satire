20 more Taliban POWs Released 
The government of Burhanuddin Rabbani today released 20 more Taliban
Islamic student fighters captured during fighting, a report from Kabul
said.
The 20 Taliban fighters, handed over to Mohammad Khan Sherani, leader
of Pakistan's Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI), took a minibus and drove out of
Kabul towards the southern frontlines in Logar province, some 30
kilometers from the capital, the report said.
"We released the Taliban to Sherani as a gesture of goodwill," said
Sidiq Chakari, Rabbani's representative, Minister of Frontier Affairs.
A total of 31 Taliban have now been released in Kabul while eight
pro-Rabbani troops have been received in exchange. However, large
numbers of prisoners remain on both sides.
