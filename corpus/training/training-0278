World's First Salt Well Still Working 
A 160-year-old salt well with a depth of more than 1,000 meters,
believed to be the oldest of its kind in the world, is still turning
out edible salt every day.
At present, local workers continue to produce salt with methods passed
down for generations, but production has been only on a small scale as
a demonstration for visitors since the well was listed as a
cultural-relic site.
The salt well, called Shenhai, was dug in 1835 in the city of Zigong in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
"Salt production here involves several processes, which incorporate the
wisdom of salt workers of the past," said one worker.
"For instance, we add some soybean to skim off impurities so the salt
won't be gritty," he added.
Experts say that although the salt from the Shenhai well has a low
iodine content, it does contain rich trace elements, and pickled
vegetable made with this salt has a distinctive flavor.
The city of Zigong has been turning out salt for 1,900 years, and it
led the world in salt-well mining and salt production for more than a
century, until the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1911.
