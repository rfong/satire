China's State-Owned Enterprises to Increase Efficiency 
China's State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are now working under a "code of
conduct" which means they must quicken the pace of modernization and
improve their management.
The code was worked out at a time when the country is already pressing
ahead with SOE reforms and preparing for entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), according to today's China Daily.
Sheng Huaren, minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, was
cited by the paper as saying that it was necessary to have a code of
conduct which lays down the basics for setting up a modern corporate
system in China, and sets out the fundamental requirements for
enterprises to strengthen management.
Such a code, if implemented to the letter, will propel forward SOE
reforms and add to the competence and confidence of State- owned
businesses in braving the challenges they face with entry into the WTO.
Under the 69-article code, all large and medium-sized SOEs, except
State monopolies, will be gradually transformed into limited and stock
companies with multiple shareholders.
The code, revised and endorsed by State leaders including Premier Zhu
Rongji, highlights making and implementing "correct development
strategies" for the SOEs, and urges them to set up a rational decision
making mechanism, and emphasizes the application of modern information
technology such as electronic commerce.
