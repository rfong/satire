Republican-run House kills party's own plan for missile defense system 
The House of Representatives dealt a blow to the Republican party
leadership Wednesday, rejecting a proposal calling for the revival of
an ambitious antiballistic missile defense system.
An amendment defeated by a vote of 218 to 211 would have forced
President Bill Clinton to bring back the research program dubbed "Star
Wars" and scrapped in 1993 by the Democratic president.
Twenty-four Republicans joined Democrats in voting against an amendment
that Clinton called "an assault on the authority of the president."
Lawmakers will continue discussions Thursday on the bill, part of the
Republicans' "Contract with America" initiative that deals with
boosting national defense. The bill also contains Republican proposals
to reduce US spending on UN operations and to give some countries
priority in joining NATO.
Clinton administration officials said the resumption of the space- and
ground-based missile program would tie the president's hands and divert
funds needed for other essential defense programs.
