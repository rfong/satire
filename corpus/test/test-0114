Liverpool to Erect Heysel Memorial 
Liverpool Football Club are to erect a memorial inside their Anfield
ground to commemorate the victims of the Heysel stadium disaster, said
the club on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the biggest soccer
tragedy in history.
The monument will be a replica of a three meters tall sculpture that
stands in Juventus's stadium in Turin.
It depicts a soccer terrace and commemorates the death of the 39
Italian fans amid crowd riot before the European Cup final between the
two clubs in Brussels on May 29, 1985.
