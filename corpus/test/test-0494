Turkish Ambassador Protests Opening of Kurdish Office 
Turkey criticized Denmark Tuesday for letting a political branch of the
militant Kurdish independence group PKK open an office in Copenhagen.
The Kurdistan National Liberation Front, known by its acronym ERNK,
``is controlled by terrorists and is (itself) engaged in criminal
activities,'' claimed Turkish Ambassador Osman Faruk Logoglu.
``They shouldn't be allowed to establish an office here,'' Logoglu
said.
Kurdish spokeswoman Rumet Sinem said the ERNK office, set to open April
25, would be the fourth in Europe after Athens, Vienna and Rome.
There are roughly 20,000 Kurds in Denmark.
The ERNK is the political wing of the armed Kurdistan Workers' Party,
or PKK, which has been fighting since 1984 for autonomy in the
southeastern Turkey.
In recent years, the PKK itself has been linked to attacks against
Turkish interest across Europe.
The Danish government has said it has no intention of banning the PKK
in Denmark. Germany and France have banned the PKK and its related
organizations, including the ERNK.
The Turkish ambassador, Logoglu, said he will meet with Danish Foreign
Ministry officials on Wednesday to protest the opening of the ERNK
office.
