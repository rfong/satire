China's Largest Computer Mall Opens 
A 60,000-sq-m computer mall, the largest of its kind in China, opened
today in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
The mall, called Chengdu Shiji Computer Town, is capable of
accommodating 1,000 businesses. The U.S. IBM corporation and Chinese
computer giants Legend and Fangzheng have all set up sales agencies at
the new facility.
It has been learned that an international computer festival will be
held in the mall in October.
Here are now over 2,000 computer sales dealers in Chengdu, with sales
volume expecting to exceed 700,000 units this year.
