Czech Cabinet Resigns 
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus announced his resignation and that of
his government early today.
Klaus told a press conference that he would not seek to be part of any
new cabinet.
The announcement follows a public call from President Vaclav Havel for
the ruling coalition to resign after allegations that Klaus's party
received illegal funding.
"I decided to resign and it means that the whole government will
resign, the government as a whole," Klaus said.
"I'll hand in my resignation to the president of the republic," he told
a news conference after a meeting of the leadership of his Civic
Democratic Party.
Klaus said he would remain as Chairman of the Civic Democratic Party
until an extraordinary party congress is called within two weeks.
President Havel earlier Saturday urged the three leaders of the ruling
coalition parties to meet on Sunday afternoon to discuss formation of a
new government.
