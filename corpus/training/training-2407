Mozambique to Export Electricity to Zimbabwe 
Mozambique will export 500 megawatts of electricity to Zimbabwe after a
transmission line linking the two countries is completed in 1997, the
Mozambican News Agency reported today.
The project of building the 125-km line, which starts at Songo at the
Cahora Bassa power station and ends up at Bindura in Zimbabwe, will
begin construction next January, with a cost of 25 million US dollars,
Supervisor Tommy Lindh was quoted as saying.
Civil war has seriously damaged the transmission line which linked the
station with that in South Africa. After its rehabilitation, production
of the Cahora Bassa power station will be brought back to normal, to
its original capacity of generating 2,000 megawatts a year.
