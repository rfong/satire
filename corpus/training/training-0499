Swedish industry downgrades growth forecast to 0.9 percent 
The Swedish economy will grow only moderately, by 0.9 percent, this
year, the federation of Swedish industry forecast on Thursday,
downgrading a figure of 1.1 percent forecast in October.
Inflation would be 2.4 percent instead of 3.3 percent forecast in
October.
The unadjusted rate of unemployment would be about 8.0 percent instead
of 7.6 percent expected in October.
The federation said that industrial output, which had risen by 8.5
percent, on the basis of estimates, in 1995, was likely to decline by
0.5 percent this year.
