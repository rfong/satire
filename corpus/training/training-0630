Wounded US soldier evacuated to Germany
A US soldier shot and wounded after he challenged an intruder at a US
military base near here was evacuated Monday to Germany, an IFOR
spokesman said.
Specialist Shawn Austin was flown to a US military hospital at
Landstuhl, Germany, to recover from the gunshot wound to his left
shoulder, the spokesman said.
Army surgeon Major Sarryl Cuda said Austin was "in good spirits" and
was expected to make a full recovery.
The 21-year-old tank driver was on a perimeter foot patrol at a camp
near Tuzla, northeast Bosnia, early Friday when he spotted an intruder.
When he was challenged, the intruder fired a shot, hitting Austin in
the shoulder, before fleeing.
