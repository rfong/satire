Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi will make an official visit to
Thailand next Friday as part of his Southeast Asian tour aimed at
exchanging views on how to resolve the regional economic crisis,
according to the Thai Foreign Ministry.
Thailand will use the two-day visit to ask Japan to assist Thailand in
easing liquidity and other problems faced by the Thai private sector,
Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul was quoted Saturday by
the Nation as saying.
Thailand is looking forward to Japan's help in opening the Japanese
market to Thai products and also in developing education and human
resources in Thailand, the spokesman said.
