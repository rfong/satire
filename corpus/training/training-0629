Economy in Southwest Romania Suffers From NATO Air Strikes 
The economy in southwest Romania has been affected greatly by the NATO
air strikes against Yugoslavia with some enterprises moving on the edge
of bankruptcy.
Since the air strikes started on March 24, Romanian-Yugoslav border
trade has been cut and many enterprises in Romania's Timis and
Caras-Severin have failed to fulfill the contracts signed with their
Yugoslav counterparts.
Traffic on the border has also been cut and both cargo and passenger
transport on the Danube halted.
Since the United Nations imposed sanctions against Yugoslavia in 1992,
Romania has suffered an estimated loss of 7 billion U.S. dollars in
trade with the country, though trade volume between them amounted to
180 million U.S. dollars last year.
