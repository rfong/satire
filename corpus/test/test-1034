Bush, Jiang agree to push for joint working group on climate change 
US President George W. Bush and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin
agreed Thursday to work for the formation of a joint working group to
study climate change and environmental protection, a Chinese spokesman
said.
The two presidents reached the agreement during talks in Beijing
shortly after Bush arrived in the Chinese capital for a 30-hour visit,
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan said.
"It was agreed during the talks between the two presidents that they
will work for the establishment of a joint environmental protection and
climate-change working group," he said.
Kong said the working group will not change the two countries'
respective positions on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which requires wealthy
nations to cut to 1990 levels the emissions of greenhouse gases blamed
for global warming.
"(The agreement was reached) on the basis that it will not prejudice
their original positions on the Kyoto Protocol and the (United Nations)
Climate Change (Framework) Convention," he said.
Bush, in one of his first actions upon taking office in January 2001,
ended US support for the Kyoto rGuocol, which had been signed by the US
administration under ex-president Bill Clinton but rejected by the
Republican party.
Earlier this month Bush unveiled a new plan, saying Kyoto had unfairly
exempted large developing nations like India and China, maintaining his
scheme would give such countries a "yardstick" for progress against
pollution.
Shortly after the Bush plan was published, China's foreign ministry
said it was actively considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.
