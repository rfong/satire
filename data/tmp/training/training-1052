''/''

The/DT statement/NN was/VBD issued/VBN after/IN the/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP 's/POS closed-door/JJ discussion/NN of/IN the/DT report/NN presented/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP 's/POS Sanctions/NNP Committee/NNP ./.

The/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP accused/VBD the/DT rebels/NNS of/IN being/VBG primarily/RB responsible/JJ for/IN sabotaging/VBG a/DT 1994/CD peace/NN accord/NN that/WDT ended/VBD 20/CD years/NNS of/IN civil/JJ war/NN ./.

UNITA/NNP refused/VBD to/TO disarm/VB and/CC hand/VB over/RP land/NN under/IN its/PRP$ control/NN to/TO the/DT government/NN as/IN called/VBN for/IN in/IN the/DT peace/NN accords/NNS ./.

This/DT would/MD make/VB it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO prosecute/VB those/DT who/WP provide/VBP military/JJ or/CC logistical/JJ support/NN to/TO the/DT rebels/NNS ./.

He/PRP said/VBD the/DT committee/NN is/VBZ trying/VBG to/TO determine/VB what/WP measures/VBZ to/TO impose/VB to/TO limit/VB UNITA/NNP 's/POS ability/NN to/TO communicate/VB with/IN one/CD another/DT and/CC the/DT outside/JJ world/NN ./.

The/DT peace/NN agreement/NN collapsed/VBD in/IN early/JJ December/NNP last/JJ year/NN when/WRB government/NN forces/NNS failed/VBD in/IN its/PRP$ attempt/NN to/TO seize/VB the/DT UNITA-held/JJ territory/NN by/IN force/NN ./.
