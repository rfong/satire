Cosmonauts Make Second Spacewalk to Prepare for Atlantis
Pushing the recommended limits of human endurance in open space for the
second time in five days, two cosmonauts struggled to move a solar
battery on the Mir space station during a grueling six-hour spacewalk
Wednesday.
Even after an extra, unplanned 30 minutes in space, Mission Commander
Vladimir Dezhurov and Flight Engineer Gennady Strekalov couldn't fully
attach the battery _ but they had already been out nearly as long as
their spacesuit life-support systems would allow.
The weary cosmonauts climbed back in the Mir after more than six hours,
joining U.S. astronaut Norman Thagard, who had remained inside alone to
monitor their progress.
The spacewalk was the second of four planned to prepare Mir for the
docking of the Spektr research module and the arrival next month of the
U.S. shuttle Atlantis.
``Up there, it turned out some things took longer than planned, others
had to be modified, and the cosmonauts did not have anyone to consult
with,'' said Vera Medvedkova, a spokeswoman for Russian Mission
Control.
``They had to figure out everything on their own,'' she said.
The cosmonauts were moving a solar battery and cables to make room for
the Spektr, which is due to be launched May 20. It will dock with Mir
about a week later.
They moved the battery into place, but were unable to properly attach
it, Medvedkova said. Instead, the cosmonauts tied it with ropes
ordinarily used to prevent their tools from floating away.
The battery now remains unplugged from Mir's electricity system.
``No one can foresee such things, and it was nobody's fault it took too
long,'' she said. ``In fact, just before the cosmonauts stopped to
rest, Mission Control praised them very warmly for their work.''
The cosmonauts also had to complete some work they failed to finish
last Friday in a difficult, six-hour spacewalk that ran nearly an hour
over schedule.
Russian specialists recommend that spacewalks be kept under six hours,
and the cosmonauts' spacesuit life-support systems were designed with
this limit in mind, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
Numerous NASA spacewalks have exceeded six hours, with the longest one
lasting eight hours 29 minutes in 1992. However, NASA prefers to keep
its spacewalks to about six hours, and the U.S. spacesuits have a
maximum limit of just over seven hours.
After that, the electric power supplied by a battery wears down, said
James Hartsfield, a NASA spokesman. ``Seven hours is okay, but at that
point you go to the airlock and plug in your umbilical and recharge the
suit,'' he said.
The Russian cosmonauts are expected to attach and plug in the Mir solar
battery during their next spacewalk, planned for Saturday.
The Atlantis is scheduled to fly to Mir in late June. Cosmonauts
Anatoly Solovyov and Nikolai Budarin plan to transfer to Mir from the
Atlantis, and Thagard will return to earth aboard the shuttle.
It will be the first of seven planned shuttle flights to the aging Mir
space station, which was launched in 1986.
In future space-cooperation plans, the United States, Russia, Japan,
Canada and European countries hope to start work on an international
space station to be completed by 2002.
