Ship in distress off South African cape: 33 on board 
Rescue vessels and a helicopter left Cape Town in gale-force winds
Saturday to save passengers and crew from the MV Olivebank, in distress
off the Cape coast, the SAPA news agency reported.
The 1,700-ton container ship suffered a power failure in rough seas
about 52 kilometres (32 miles) off Cape Point and its engine room is
rapidly filling with water, SAPA said.
A tug, Wolraad Woltemade, and other vessels left Cape Town harbour to
assist the Olivebank and its 26 crew and seven passengers after the
ship sent out a distress call at about 8.3O a.m. (0630 GMT) Saturday.
Rescuers are expected to reach the 171-metre-long (564 foot) Olivebank
by 2 p.m. (1200 GMT), SAPA said.
The ship was at 35.12.2 degrees south latitude, 18.25.7 east longitude
off Cape Point, a Cape Town radio station said.
Weather conditions are very bad with ten-metre (33 foot) swells, poor
visibility and gale-force winds.
"The weather forecast is pretty grim at the moment," said Pierre
Leblond, an official with Cape Town Port Control. "Gale force winds are
expected to stay with us for the rest of the weekend."
Leblond said the vessel was in no immediate danger of sinking, but said
the harbour was having trouble communicating with the Olivebank.
Storms lashed the Cape peninsula overnight, closing roads and railway
lines. The Cape Town harbour has been closed to all vessels except
rescue craft.
