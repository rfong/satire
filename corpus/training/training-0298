Australian Commission into police vice ends with shocking finds 
A marathon royal commission into widespread corruption and paedophile
protection in the police service ended Thursday after two years and
four months of sittings that produced mounds of shocking evidence.
The enquiry, originally set up under Judge James Wood to investigate
corruption in the New South Wales police force, last year turned its
focus onto allegations of police protection of paedophile networks.
It found evidence of widespread and sometimes organised paedophilia in
schools and welfare departments and confirmed that corruption in the
police service was endemic.
Evidence, sometimes on videotape, was presented of officers dealing
drugs in nightclubs, buying child pornography and snorting cocaine with
prostitutes.
Scores of officers have quit or been sacked or suspended pending
prosecution which is expected to begin now the commission has finished.
Of the many scalps the enquiry claimed, the most recent was the elite
police Special Branch, which was disbanded Wednesday following evidence
of gross impropriety.
Perhaps its most disturbing chapter was the suicide of former Supreme
Court judge David Yeldham last November, hours after admitting to
investigators he had been questioned by police about indecent behaviour
in the toilets of a railway station.
A Special Branch officer told the commission this week that some of his
colleagues had protected Yeldham from prosecution for indecency, with
the inference that police received favourable judgements in return.
Royal Commissioner James Wood's final report into police corruption is
to be given to the New South Wales state government at the end of
April. His second report, into paedophiles, will be with government by
June 30.
It is believed to be among the most costly and longest-running royal
commissions in Australian history.
