Dhaka Decides Not to Permit Polythene Production 
The Bangladeshi government Sunday decided that no new industries would
be permitted to produce polythene, a key pollutant that dirties the
country's environment, The Financial Express reported Monday.
The decision was made at a meeting of the National Environment
Committee (NEC), and the meeting also agreed to ban in phases the
import of two-stroke engines, which emits black smoke into the
atmosphere, as part of a set of anti-pollution measures.
The NEC asked the concerned ministries to take measures for increasing
the use of jute and clothes to obviate the adverse impact of polythene
on the environment.
Those present at the meeting had a detailed discussion on the
production and limited use of polythene, controlling black smoke and
environment pollution by tannery industries.
The NEC meeting decided to gear up the drives at different points to
stop emission of black smoke from vehicles.
The meeting requested the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation and
concerned refineries to take necessary measures for the sale of fuel in
lid containers to ensure lead-free fuels.
