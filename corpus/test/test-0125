Political Activist Wins Election Rights 
A Hong Kong man who spent 10 years in a Chinese jail for political
crimes can contest local elections even though he doesn't satisfy a
residency requirement, the High Court ruled Thursday.
The Hong Kong government had barred Lau San-ching, a 41-year-old social
worker, from standing in district elections last September because of a
law saying candidates must have resided in this British colony for 10
years.
Lau was in prison in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong from
1981 to 1991 on charges on ``counter-revolutionary'' activities.
Lau had accused the Hong Kong government of barring him because it
wanted to appease China, which regains sovereignty over the territory
in 1997. His lawyers said he would have lived in Hong Kong had he been
able.
The court's ruling means Lau can run in municipal elections scheduled
for March.
``I think we made history,'' Lau said.
