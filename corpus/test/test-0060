Tennis Craze Hits UK Pubs
As is usual at this time of year the tennis craze has hit the UK hard,
with the Queens and Wimbledon tournaments making the brits literally
drool whilst watching in an often comatose and inebriated state. Pubs
have been quick to latch on to this craze, and are steadily replacing
unused and broken darts boards with full sized tennis courts.
Darts players have shown keen interest in the "Pub Tennis" game. "It's
just like darts, but bigger, and no numbers."
Remarked one bystander. "I like to play darts, but the boards are too
small and I can never see where I'm aiming for, not since that bloody
great big dog stole my glasses anyway. Tennis is an absolute doddle in
comparison. All I need to do is whack the ball into the huge area on
the other side of the net, much easier than getting a pin with wings to
fit in a 1 inch square on a darts board from 6ft away I can tell you."
Darts umpires are also finding the transition from darts to tennis
rather easy. "Well, it's all the same, except I don't have to say
'One-Hundred-And-Eaaaaaaiiiiigggggtttttttteeeeeeeee' anymore." Stated
one ex-darts umpire.
"The end of rounds are all the same as darts, like 'Game-Shot, and the
first set, Tim Henman to serve first', just an example. Another great
thing about it being in the pub is that we can have instant replays
with the CCTV. It's far better than Wimbledon, I feel, and you can have
a pint of bitter and a packet of pork scratchings while your at it,
marvellous! Not only that but swearing at the umpires is compulsary.
Incidentally, Greg Rusedski is seeded number 1 in the Pub Tennis
rankings."
The Pub Tennis Organisation (PTO) is said to be in talks with ITV, to
show televised Pub Tennis matches next summer to rival the BBC's
wimbledon coverage. PTO gave the following statement, "We would've sold
it to the BBC, but they said they couldn't spare any time to show the
matches. They told us that next year, they hope to show Wimbledon all
day on BBC 1, 2, 3, 4, News 24, and all their extra 'interactive'
digital channels."
The craze is also catching on in other countries around the globe, and
experts predict that in five years time we will have become really bad
at yet another sport we invented.
