Ivanov Takes Ninth Stage at Tour de France 
Russian Serguei Ivanov took Monday's ninth stage of the Tour de France
while Australia's Stuart O'Grady returned his yellow jersey when the
race reached at Aix-Les-Bains of France.
Ivanov was in a lead pack halfway from the end of the 185- kilometer
(114.89-mile) stretch from Pontarlier in the Jura mountains to this
town at the foot of the French Alps.
The Fassa Bortolo rider clocked a winning time of three hours 57
minutes and 48 seconds, followed by Spain's David Etxebarria in second
place and Australian Bradley McGee in third.
O'Grady was more than 20 seconds off the pace but it was enough for the
Credit Agricole rider to retain the leader's yellow jersey.
