``/`` The/DT social/JJ consequences/NNS of/IN the/DT crisis/NN vary/VBP across/RP countries/NNS according/VBG to/TO the/DT extent/NN of/IN the/DT downturn/NN and/CC dislocation/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD the/DT bank/NN in/IN its/PRP$ ``/`` Asian/NNP Development/NNP Outlook/NNP 1999/CD ''/'' released/VBN here/RB Tuesday/NNP ./.

While/IN the/DT poor/JJ and/CC vulnerable/JJ groups/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN women/NNS ,/, children/NNS ,/, and/CC migrant/NN workers/NNS ,/, are/VBP invariably/RB most/JJS at/IN risk/NN ,/, the/DT bank/NN said/VBD ,/, the/DT impact/NN of/IN the/DT 22-month-old/JJ crisis/NN is/VBZ pervasive/JJ ,/, hurting/VBG all/DT social/JJ classes/NNS ,/, particularly/RB middle-and-lower-middle-income/JJ ones/NNS ./.

The/DT bank/NN said/VBD the/DT unemployment/NN rate/NN in/IN Indonesia/NNP rose/VBD to/TO 5.5/CD percent/NN in/IN 1998/CD from/IN 4.7/CD in/IN 1997/CD ,/, and/CC in/IN Thailand/NNP the/DT rate/NN reached/VBD 5.3/CD percent/NN ,/, compared/VBN with/IN just/RB above/IN 1/CD percent/NN the/DT previous/JJ year/NN ./.

``/`` However/RB ,/, these/DT figures/NNS probably/RB underestimated/VBD the/DT true/JJ extent/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN ,/, as/IN underemployment/NN is/VBZ also/RB likely/JJ to/TO have/VB increased/VBN markedly/RB ,/, ''/'' the/DT bank/NN said/VBD ./.

Besides/IN ,/, the/DT bank/NN said/VBD ,/, the/DT crisis/NN has/VBZ reduced/VBN household/NN expenditure/NN in/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN important/JJ social/JJ areas/NNS ,/, including/VBG health/NN and/CC nutrition/NN ,/, education/NN ,/, and/CC family/NN planning/NN ./.
