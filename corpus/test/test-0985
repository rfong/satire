Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga said the entire team was geared up for
their first ever World Cup semi-final.
"It is the biggest game in Sri Lankan cricket history. When the
tournament began, our target was to make the semi-finals. But now we
are hungry for more. The boys have had a great World Cup so far and we
are in no mood to let up.
"The Indians are a great side, but we don't mind the tag of underdogs.
The pressure is always on the other team."
Ranatunga said the slow wicket and crowd pressure was unlikely to cause
a shift in the team's strategy of going for runs from the start.
"We have seven top-class batsmen, all capable of getting big scores at
a fast clip. It will be stupid to change something which has worked so
well for us in this World Cup.
"And I think the pressure from the 100,000 crowd will be on both teams.
It's a double-edged weapon. The Indians will want to do well in front
of their home crowd. I think we can take that pressure," Ranatunga
said.
