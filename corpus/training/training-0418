North China Deal With Desertification 
North China's Hebei Province is to return some 260,000 hectares of
farmland to forests and grassland in five years to improve the
environment, said Bai Junjie, director of the Zhangjiakou city forestry
bureau.
Zhangjiakou, located in the northwestern part of the province, is more
than 1,000 meters higher at the sea level than Beijing, which directly
influences the ecology of the Chinese capital.
Bashang, a vast grassland in the city is now facing 70 percent of
desertification and soil erosion due to over-cultivation and a surplus
of livestock. Only 110,000 hectares of forests and about 400,000
hectares of grasslands remain.
The farmland returning project aims to bring the green coverage in the
province from 12 percent to 22 percent.
