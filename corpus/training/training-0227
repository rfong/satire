Yeltsin Rests Before Helsinki Summit 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin will take a two-day rest in his
out-of-town residence, Gorki-9, before his departure to Helsinki for a
summit with his U.S. counterpart, Bill Clinton.
Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said today that before
leaving for Gorki-9, Yeltsin would be briefed for the forthcoming
Russia-U.S. summit by Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
The foreign minister has just had talks with American officials in
Washington, and was returning home today.
No other meetings or events for Yeltsin were scheduled in the next two
days, Yastrzhembsky added.
