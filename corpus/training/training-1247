Nigeria to Set Up Transitional Government 
Nigeria may set up a transitional government to supervise the
transition to civil rule program of the military government of General
Sani Abacha, the Nigerian Tribune reported today.
The newspaper quoted competent sources in Abuja as saying that the
government may announce the plan on October 1, the 30th anniversary of
Nigeria's independence.
Abacha may also announce his decision on whether or not he will run for
the next president in his routine national broadcast on that day, the
report said.
According to the report, Abacha's meeting with the six most influential
members of the government last week may have convinced him of the need
to clear his position on the presidency in time so that the whole
transition program will not be affected.
"Although the issue was still largely decided, the view has been
gaining ground that General Abacha may not run in the election after
all," the newspaper said.
There have been much speculations and debates both in and out of
Nigeria on whether Abacha will or should contest in the transitional
program designed by himself.
