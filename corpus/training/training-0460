Examinations to Improve Quality of China's Police 
Police throughout China now have to face assessment tests every five
years which check their qualifications and effectiveness, a procedure
which will gauge if they can retain their jobs, said an official with
the Ministry of Public Security today.
The measure is aimed at improving the overall quality of police and
encourage a merit certification system, said Tian Qiyu, vice-minister
of public security, adding that the directors of public security
bureaus at county level should also be expected to sit an examination
before taking up their posts.
By the end of last year, 510,000 members of police forces in 36 of
China's larger cities, and public security departments in railway,
transport, civil aviation, and other sectors, had taken such exams,
with one percent failing.
Those with college education make up more than 30 percent of the total
number of police , but there are only 22.5 percent of the police who
actually graduated from police schools. The overall quality of police
at the grass-roots level is a continual worry for the government, Tian
said.
He said that the examination system will be expanded from the existing
city locations to public security departments at prefecture and county
levels this year, with 600,000 police expected to take the exam.
