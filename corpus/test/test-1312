DVDs Of Olympics Somehow Available On Sidewalk Already
Several hours before the opening ceremony Thursday, ambitious Chinese
street vendors obtained bootleg copies of the complete 2008 Beijing
Olympics coverage, pressed DVD copies of the footage, and sold DVDs for
five to seven dollars apiece from blankets spread out on the sidewalk. "I
was really surprised that I was able to get a hold of this so early,
especially with all the reports that the Chinese were going to prevent the
results from being leaked," said San Francisco resident Todd Saunders. "The
footage was pretty grainy and you could tell they just shot it off of a
screen with a camcorder, but for the price I thought it was worth it."
Although Saunders said he was surprised to find himself tearing up while
watching the closing ceremony, he admitted that the performance dedicated
to the athletes tragically lost to Turkish terrorism on days three through
five was quite touching.
