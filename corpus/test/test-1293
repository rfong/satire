Jiang Delivers Speech on Military Science
Military science research consists of basic research and application
research, which are closely related and support each other, said Jiang,
adding that the research should focus on problems of realistic
significance while strengthening basic studies.
The quality of the military science research depends on the quality of
the researchers, Jiang said, stressing that the training of skilled
professionals in the field should be given strategic importance.
Jiang said military science is a comprehensive subject, which involves
social sciences, natural sciences and many other fields. The building
of the research force should be based on skilled professionals who have
a solid theoretical basis of Marxism and a wide-ranging knowledge of
politics, economy, military, history and, especially, high-technology.
They should have rich practical army experience, he said, as well as
devotion and rigorous scientific approaches.
Jiang sent warm greetings and congratulations to all researchers of the
academy on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military
Commission, extending high tribute to elder officers and researchers
who had made great contributions to the nation's military science
research cause.
Also attending today's event were Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission; Zhao Nanqi, vice-chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee; and Fu
Quanyou, Yu Yongbo, Wang Ke, and Wang Ruilin, all members of the
Central Military Commission.
