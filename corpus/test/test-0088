Shock As Female British Tennis Player Beats Half-decent Opponent
London city council are expected to organize a homecoming for British
tennis player Anne Keovathong within the next fortnight after she
managed to beat a half-decent tennis player in world number 25
Francesca Schiavone yesterday at the US Open in New York.
"This surpasses anything our Olympians achieved", admitted Mayor Boris
Johnson. "I'm in shock, like the rest of you."
"Britain have finally got a female player that isn't completely
rubbish! I'm not sure I quite believe it!", enthused Virginia Wade,
before fainting.
Keovathong, apparently a Brit, managed to hit shots over the net and
actually made them land in more often than not, leading many observers
to question her nationality, including the woman herself.
"Pretty surprised with myself really", admits Anne. "I've checked my
passport and it says I'm British. I've asked mum and dad whether I was
adopted or something from America or India but no, they say I was born
and raised here. Something doesn't add up."
Indeed, but what does add up is the numbers expected to welcome her
home.
"Turnout is expected to surpass 5 million", reveals Jamiroquai. "First
Bigfoot, now this. It's virtual insanity these times we're living in!
Woo hoo hoo!"
Alas, Keovathong has revealed that many of her fellow Brits haven't
taken kindly to her newfound success.
"Some of the other girls like Elena Baltacha are being a bit bitchy
about it. They call me a sell-out and a Judas and other nasty names
like 'Little miss actually win a match' and 'Little miss not totally
rubbish at tennis'. I just have to ignore that and focus on my game."
And what a game it is, Anne. What a game it is.
Editor's Note: It has since been discovered that the person assumed to
be Jamiroquai above was actually a dwarf with a funny hat, and head of
London city council, Mitch Edwoody.
