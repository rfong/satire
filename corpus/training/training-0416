Italy to Continue Its Middle East Policies, Says Official 
The Italian government will stick to its existing policies toward the
peace process in the Middle East, said Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli
Tuesday.
In a statement issued after his talks with senior Palestinian official
Faisal Husseini, who is in charge of affairs of East Jerusalem, Agnelli
said Italy, as the current chairman of the European Union (EU), will
make contributions to the development of both its relations and EU's
relations with Palestine.
Husseini extended his thanks to Italy for its political, economic and
humanitarian support to his country.
He said he hopes that Italy and the EU will, as always, pay close
attention to the peace process in the Middle East.
