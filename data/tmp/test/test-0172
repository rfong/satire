For/IN the/DT past/JJ five/CD years/NNS the/DT Russian/JJ bear/NN was/VBD cuddly/JJ and/CC cooperative/JJ ./.

Meetings/NNS between/IN Boris/NNP Yeltsin/NNP and/CC Presidents/NNPS Bush/NNP and/CC Clinton/NNP were/VBD love/NN feasts/NNS ,/, complete/JJ with/IN embraces/NNP ,/, vows/NNP of/IN friendship/NN and/CC announcements/NNS of/IN plans/NNS to/TO end/VB the/DT Cold/NNP War/NNP nuclear/JJ standoff/NN ./.

``/`` Russia/NNP can/MD no/DT more/RBR embrace/VB the/DT West/NN fully/RB than/IN it/PRP can/MD reject/VB it/PRP entirely/RB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Leon/NNP Aron/NNP ,/, a/DT Russian/JJ expert/NN at/IN the/DT American/NNP Enterprise/NNP Institute/NNP ./.

Clinton/NNP set/VBD the/DT tone/NN concerning/VBG U.S./NNP reaction/NN to/TO Russian/JJ troops/NNS moving/VBG into/IN the/DT rebellious/JJ province/NN of/IN Chechnya/NNP when/WRB he/PRP described/VBD it/PRP as/IN ``/`` largely/RB an/DT internal/JJ conflict/NN that/IN the/DT Russians/NNPS are/VBP dealing/VBG with/IN ./.

Russian/JJ rejection/NN of/IN NATO/NNP was/VBD another/DT matter/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT reaction/NN was/VBD more/RBR sorrow/JJ than/IN anger/NN when/WRB Yeltsin/NNP asked/VBD why/WRB the/DT West/NNP wanted/VBD to/TO ``/`` sow/VB the/DT seeds/NNS of/IN mistrust/NN ''/'' by/IN expanding/VBG NATO/NNP eastward/RB but/CC stopping/VBG short/JJ of/IN including/VBG Russia/NNP ./.
