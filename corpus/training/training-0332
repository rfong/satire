Iranian Vice President in Kuwait for Improving Bilateral Ties 
Iranian Vice President for Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Mohammad Ali
Sadooqi arrived here Thursday for an official visit to Kuwait aimed at
enhancing bilateral relations.
In a statement to reporters upon his arrival, Sadooqi praised friendly
ties between Iran and Kuwait at all levels.
He also voiced satisfaction with the current cooperation between the
two countries' parliaments and the role of the Kuwaiti-Iranian
Parliament Friendship Committee in promoting bilateral relations in all
fields.
During his five-day visit, Sadooqi is scheduled to meet with Kuwaiti
Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah and convey him a letter on
bilateral ties from Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
The Iranian vice president will also meet with Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Salem al- Sabah, and First
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad
al-Jaber al-Sabah.
Sadooqi indicated that the possible topics he will discuss with the
Kuwaiti officials are likely to cover the drug trafficking issue in the
region.
He said that the drug issue poses a serious danger to the region,
noting that Gulf countries "can combat this phenomenon by the will and
determination of their officials."
Iran and Saudi Arabia signed a security agreement last March to jointly
fight against drugs trafficking, money laundering and other organized
crimes.
But Sadooqi said the issue concerning the demarcation of a disputed
continental shelf in the northern Gulf will not be discussed during the
visit.
Kuwait, Iran and Saudi Arabia all claim sovereignty over the triangle
area where oil and gas reserves have been found.
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement on this issue last July,
while Iran has agreed to hold talks with its two neighbors to solve
this maritime dispute.
