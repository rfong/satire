Dollar Moves Higher on Yen in Tokyo After Intervention 
The U.S. dollar moved slightly higher on the Japanese yen in Tokyo
Thursday as market players returned to dollar buying in the absence of
follow-up intervention.
The U.S. currency was quoted at 136.87-90 yen at 5 p.m. (local time),
up from 135.70-75 yen at 9 a.m., and from 136.45-55 yen late Wednesday
in New York.
During the day, the dollar fell to 135.50 yen at one point, its lowest
level in Tokyo in almost a month.
Market players pushed the dollar higher against the yen, albeit less
aggressively than in recent days, in the wake of the intervention by
the United States and Japan early Wednesday in New York, which sent the
dollar from 142 yen to 137 yen.
Japanese insurers, institutional investors and importers showed solid
dollar-buying interest during the day, which pushed the dollar to
higher levels against the yen, dealers said.
But concern that the Bank of Japan would enter the market during the
Tokyo dealing helped keep the dollar from climbing too fast, they said.
Market players avoided aggressive dealing during the day ahead of the
expected arrival of U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to
Japan, and his meetings with Japanese monetary officials.
A Group of Seven (G7) meeting of finance ministers' deputies Saturday
in Tokyo also gave participants reason to be cautious, dealers said.
