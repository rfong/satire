Syria Intervenes to Help Resolve Government Crisis
Syria, which holds sway in Lebanon, stepped in Sunday to mediate in a
political feud that toppled the Lebanese government.
Accompanied by top commanders of the 40,000 Syrian troops deployed in
Lebanon, Bashar Assad, the son of Syrian President Hafez Assad, met
Lebanon's president at his palace, apparently to press for quick
appointment of a prime minister and formation of a new Cabinet.
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri resigned Friday. He accused his
half-Christian, half-Muslim Cabinet of hampering his dlrs 18 million
program to rebuild Lebanon after the 1975-90 civil war.
The resignation of the 50-year-old Sunni Muslim billionaire was seen as
a maneuver to oust the ministers hindering his policies.
President Elias Hrawi was expected to reappoint Hariri, who has wide
support in parliament.
In an important sign, Nabih Berri, a Shiite Muslim whose Amal militia
was a main Syrian ally in the civil war, has backed Hariri's
reappointment.
The government and Parliament are largely packed with Syria's
supporters, but squabbles over the distribution of key portfolios and
the exclusion of Hariri's critics could lead Syria to intervene in the
formation of a Cabinet.
Hariri has been credited with stabilizing Lebanon's currency since he
took office in October 1992, and many Lebanese see him as the only hope
for reconstruction.
But living standards have worsened, triggering anti-government strikes
and opposition charges of corruption.
