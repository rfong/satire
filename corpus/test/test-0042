Parliament strips Crimean president of executive powers 
Crimean deputies voted Thursday to strip President Yuri Meshkov of his
executive powers, in the latest in a series of showdowns between
lawmakers and the head of state.
Parliament voted by 68 to 14 to replace Meshkov as head of the
executive with a prime minister -- a post which does not currently
exist in the separatist peninsular republic.
Meshkov immediately attacked the resolution, effectively reducing his
role to an honorary one, as "illegal".
In a speech to deputies, he accused them of trying to take on the
powers of all three branches of government -- the judiciary,
legislature and executive.
The lawmakers' vote prolongs a three-week constitutional crisis during
which parliament and the president have issued a series of as yet
unenforced resolutions and decrees in attempts to reduce each others'
respective powers.
Meshkov tried to defuse the crisis on September 22, when he rescinded
an earlier decree dissolving parliament.
A dozen deputies denounced Thursday's vote as "constitutional coup"
when they left the parliament building, the Interfax news agency
reported.
But parliamentary speaker Sergei Tsekov said it was "the only possible
outcome" to the constitutional crisis.
The feud between the president and deputies have been fuelled by
disagreement over the pace of moves to reunite Crimea with with Russia,
with lawmakers accusing Meshkov of backtracking on earlier pledges to
sever ties with Ukraine.
The then Soviet Union ceded the peninsula to Ukraine in 1954.
