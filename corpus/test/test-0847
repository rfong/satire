Pan Am Games Gold Medalist Outlasts David Wheaton
Pan Am Games gold medalist Hernan Gumy outlasted third-seeded David
Wheaton 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) Wednesday in a second-round match in the
America's Red Clay tennis tournament.
Other than his victory over fellow Argentine Javier Frana in the finals
of the Pan Am Games in March, Gumy's win over the 25th-ranked Wheaton
is a career best.
``This is the pros, it's more personal for you,'' said Gumy, 23, who's
ranked 122nd. ``When you play the Pan American Games, it's more for
your country.''
Wheaton broke Gumy's serve at 5-3 of the second set and eventually
forced a tiebreaker, which he led 3-0 before Gumy reeled off five
straight points.
At 5-4 in the tiebreaker, Gumy returned a 103 mph (165 kph) serve at
Wheaton's feet, which Wheaton was unable to handle.
Wheaton saved one match point but couldn't survive the second, as Gumy
blasted a forehand winner for a berth in the quarterfinals.
``Once we got out there, I could tell he was strong and hit hard,''
said Wheaton of Lake Minnetonka, Minn. ``It was a tough match. I give
him credit for being able to close it out in the tiebreaker.''
Frana, the eighth seed, joined his friend in the quarters with a 6-4,
6-4 victory over Michael Tebbutt of Australia.
Luke Jensen couldn't hit what he couldn't see as he fell 6-1, 6-2 to
sixth-seeded Greg Rusedski, the game's most powerful server. Rusedski,
a 6-foot-3 Canadian who set a record earlier this year with a 137 mph
(220 kph) serve past Michael Chang at San Jose, had nine aces, two
measured at 134 mph.
``It's a work of art,'' Jensen said. ``He's just got a mean, nasty
serve. It's a weapon. It's actually fun to play him, to watch that.''
In two matches this week, Rusedski won 43 of 47 points on his first
serve. He faced no break points on his serve Wednesday.
``He gets one break and you might as well close up shop,'' Jensen said.
Brett Steven, the fifth seed from New Zealand, saved four break points
on his serve and converted four of five break points against Sandon
Stolle in a 6-2, 6-2, victory over the Australian.
Fellow Australian Mark Woodforde, seeded fourth, fared better with a
6-1, 6-2 victory over Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland.
Wild-card entrant Ivan Baron, the 22-year-old son of tournament
director Mark Baron, was beaten 6-4, 6-4 by Nicolas Pereira of
Venezuela. On Monday, Baron shocked top-seeded Magnus Larsson of Sweden
for his first career ATP Tour victory.
``It was a good learning experience,'' Baron said. ``I really felt I
could play with the top players in the world now.''
