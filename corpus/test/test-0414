Cocoa Higher
After beginning lower, prices rose spectacularly to around 970
pounds per tonne on large-scale speculative buying, which dealers said
was perhaps a rebound reaction.
The market was initially hit by a delivery of cocoa from the Ivory
Coast.
Elsewhere, a meeting of the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) in
London made little progress on a plan to cut world production by around
75,000 tonnes per year. Dealers said it would be several months before
the plan began to have any effect on the market.
COFFEE: slump. Prices crashed 10 percent in two days to around 2,463
dollars per tonne, in sharpest decline seen this year, before
stabilising at 2,600 dollars per tonne after the Association of Coffee
Producing Countries (ACPC) threatened to revive an export retention
plan.
Coffee prices initially slumped as speculators withdrew after figures
for the next Brazilian harvest.
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Monday predicted Brazilian
1995-1996 production at between 15.7 and 17.7 million bags of coffee
(each of 60 kilogrammes), but dealers had expected a lower figure after
crops were hit by severe frost and then drought earlier in the year.
Prices then rose to around 2,600 dollars on fears of a new cut in
exports. Manoel Bertone, chairman of the Brazilian National Coffee
Association, said that it would be a good idea to reintroduce the APPC
export retention scheme to stop prices from crashing. His proposals
were well received in Central America.
GNI magnified fears, saying that "for the first time in six years, the
producer countries have the possibility to control the market and make
maximum profits. It would be surprising if they didn't take advantage
of this."
