WTO May Accept Russia
If negotiations go smoothly, Russia may be invited to join the World
Trade Organization in 2006. What do you think?
Old Woman
Joy Hess,
Systems Analyst
"It's amazing that, with an economy that large, Russia isn't already in
the WTO. Is it because they only import stolen cars and export
mail-order brides?"
Asian Man
Clinton Chan,
Clerk
"After all the bullshit they put James Bond through, those Russians
have a lot of nerve expecting us to become their trade allies."
Young Man
Ken Dorsey,
Logger
"Does this mean cheaper vodka? Because, honestly, that's the last thing
I need."
Black Man
Joe Roach,
Editor
"I'm starting my own Joe's Trade Organization, and it would be a real
feather in my cap to snag Russia first."
Old Man
Neil Hood,
Police Chief
"Allowing a country like Russia to join the organization would make a
mockery of whatever it is the WTO stands for."
Young Woman
Allison Church,
Midwife
"Why is this an issue? Evil Communist Russians have been a part of the
WWE since the '80s."
