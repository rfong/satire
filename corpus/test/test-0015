Romanian Coalminers' Strike Declared Illegal 
The court of Petrosani city Friday declared the coalminers' strike in
the Jiu Valley illegal, and the miners threated to come to Bucharest
unless their claims are met.
Petrosani is the most important city in Romanian biggest coalfield Jiu
Valley area, 350 km west of Bucharest.
On January 4, at the call of their leader Miron Cozma, the miners there
went on a general strike to protest at the government's measures for
the restructuring of the coal mines which caused huge losses despite
substantial state subsidies.
The government has decided to close down the most unprofitable mines in
the area and to lay off their employees on substantial redundancy pays
to allow them subsistence until new jobs may be found.
Unhappy with the proposal, the miners refused to go underground and
sent the government a list with 30 claims, among which redundancy pay
worth 10,000 U.S. dollars for each laid-off miner and the grant of a
2-hectare plot of land. They also asked for the dismissal of the
Industry and Commerce Minister.
Negotiations between the delegation of miners, led by deputy president
of the Miners' Trade Unions Confederation Victor Badarca and
Governmental delegation led, on behalf of Prime Minister Radu Vasile,
by Secretary of State in the Industry and Commerce Ministry Nicolae
Staiculescu yielded no results.
Interior Minister Gavril Dejeu announced that he had taken necessary
steps to prevent the miners' travel to Bucharest.
