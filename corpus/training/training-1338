Canadian Falungong practitioner says protest spontaneous 
The 61-year-old Canadian woman who was detained and later expelled from
China after protesting in Tiananmen Square said Friday her act was
spontaneous and rejected anything linking it to the self-immolation
incident there one year ago.
Connie Chipkar, who was taken away by plainclothed Chinese police
officers Wednesday after unveiling a sash reading "Falungong" and
"S.O.S.," told reporters here she had been on a 14-country tour before
heading to China on a one-month tourist visa.
"I was there to bring support and encouragement to those suffering in
China," she said, adding that she had not expected to be arrested even
though the Chinese government banned the movement as an "evil cult" in
July 1999.
She rejected the notion that she might have been there to mark the
one-year January 22, 2001 anniversary when five people -- claimed by
the Chinese government to be Falungong supporters -- set themselves on
fire.
A 36-year old woman died on the square and her 12-year-old daughter
died later in hospital after the incident, which was widely broadcast
on Chinese television to turn public opinion against Falungong.
Chipkar, who had been traveling since September and who is now banned
for five years from returning to China, said she thought her protest
Wednesday would coincide with the Chinese New Year.
This year's Chinese New Year falls on February 12.
She and other Falungong practitioners here reiterated they claim the
self-immolation incident was an event staged by the Chinese government.
Chipkar was the fourth Canadian and Falungong member to be detained in
China. Three others were released, with the last being expelled a few
hours after being detained in November 2001.
