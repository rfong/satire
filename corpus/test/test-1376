China Vows to Strike Hard on "Ice"
In the 1991-1999 period, China seized more than 1,500 tons of precursor
chemical flown into illicit channels, involving more than 20 kinds of
precursor chemical under state control.
In the first half of this year, anti-narcotics officers found more than
ten tons of ephedrine flown into illicit channels.
Bai said that due to increased overseas demand for precursor chemical,
drug traders at home and abroad have collaborated to conduct smuggling
activities.
During the period between 1997 and June of this year, Chinese anti-drug
officers cracked some 1,299 such cases, confiscating more than 1,100
tons of precursor chemical.
During the same period, they also stopped more than 4,000 tons of
precursor chemical, disguised as legitimate commodities, from being
exported overseas, with the help of their overseas counterparts.
