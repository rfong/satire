Libya expels more Palestinians despite deal with Egypt
Libya has forced more Palestinians to leave the country in violation of
an agreement with Egypt that it would end the expulsions, the PLO
representative to the Arab League said Friday.
Mohammad Sobeih, the PLO representive, said around 40 people in eight
Palestinian families had arrived at a makeshift camp housing 1,000
refugees in a desert no man's land between Egypt and Libya's border in
the past two days.
"Colonel Moamer Kahdafi has not yet implemented the October 6 accord
with Egypt on halting the expulsions of Palestinians," he told AFP.
"Since that date, dozens of Palestinians have continued to arrive in
small groups in no man's land at the Egyptian-Libyan border."
Egyptian border police confirmed Friday that the expulsions were
continuing."More than 200 Palestinians have arrived at the deportees
camp since October 6," said one official.
"Since that date, 800 others have been able to cross Egypt to go to the
Gaza Strip," he said, adding that they had Israeli documents enabling
them to enter the autonomous Palestinian territory.
Sobeih urged Egypt to renew its efforts to persuade Kadhafi to honour
the agreement.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa announced on October 13 that he had
secured the basis of an agreement with the Libyan president a week
earlier providing for the expulsions to be halted.
Mussa also said Kadhafi had agreed to allow the Palestinians stranded
on the border to return to Libya within two weeks.
The Libyan leader announced in September his intention to expel all
30,000 Palestinians in his country to try to show up what he called the
failure of Israeli-PLO peace accords. Almost 5,000 Palestinians have
since left Libya.
