Charlatan rabbi healer charged with swindling sick Moroccans 
An Israeli rabbi was charged with fraud in Rabat after two Moroccans,
including a paralytic, said he tricked them into believing he had cured
them, judicial officials said Sunday.
Lahoucine Adbib and Lahcen Outidnass have accused Yaakov Ifergane of
exploiting "without their consent, their names as well as their
photographs for his profit," their lawyer Ali Bendara told AFP Sunday.
The trial is to open on April 23.
The two men have filed for 10,000 dirhams (1,000 dollars) each in
damages.
If found guilty, the rabbi could face up to five years' imprisonment.
After touring Morocco in October last year, Ifergane campaigned in
Israel where he advertised his skills by claiming he had cured sick and
paralytic Moroccans.
In a letter to AFP in Rabat, Jerusalem Rabbi Shalom Messas said a
recent inquiry in Morocco by rabbis and a detective found that
"Ifergane was a false healer who exploited the people's trust."
