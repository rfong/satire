China's Li urges increased grain output by improving poor land 
Premier Li Peng has warned that poor-quality land in China must be
transformed into high-yield fields if the nation is to maintain
self-sufficiency in grain, the People's Daily reported Wednesday.
"The issue of feeding the people is of paramount importance to China,
with a population of 1.2 billion people," Li told local officials in
Jiangsu province during an inspection tour of a model township which
has transformed its low-yield land.
"We must make unremitting efforts to hit the target of increasing the
grain yield by 50 million tonnes during the 1996-2000 period ... and
there is still much room for increasing grain output," he added.
Some two-thirds of China's 122 million hectares (301 million acres) of
farmland is either low or medium yield. China is already struggling to
feed 22 percent of the world's population from only seven percent of
its arable land.
But efforts to irrigate arid areas have so far proved prohibitively
expensive and new methods of grain production are still in their
experimental phase.
Meanwhile, the ministry of agriculture launched an appeal Tuesday for
scientists and technicians to protect spring crops from a drought in
the northern wheat, corn and cotton belt and heavy rainfall in the
southern rice paddies.
More than 16.7 million farmers in northern China are experiencing
serious drought, which has delayed spring sowing, while their
compatriots in the south have had a straight-run of 40 cold, rainy and
overcast days.
Last year, China has a record grain harvest of 465 million tonnes, but
it needs to increase yields by an average annual four million tonnes
over the next 35 years to feed its population.
The US-based Worldwatch Institute has said that by 2030 China could
face a deficit of between 200 and 365 million tonnes in grain it would
need to feed its 1.6 billion people by that time.
