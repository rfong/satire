UN confirms massacre of Serbs in Krajina 
United Nations police have found evidence to support reports of a
recent massacre in the Krajina region, which Croatian troops retook in
August from rebel Serbs, a UN spokesman said Tuesday.
UN civilian police who travelled to the village of Varivode, 25
kilometers (15 miles) south of the former Serb stronghold Knin, found
eight houses spattered in blood and a lengthy trail of blood, said UN
spokesman Chris Gunness.
"In another (home) bloodstains were found on the wall along with
fragments of hair and skin. From these fragments we believe that
someone was shot standing in the entrance," said Gunness.
In Knin, the police found the graves marked with the names of nine
people who had been visited recently by UN military observers (UNMOs)
on the 11th of September and "were alive and well," he said.
The United Nations has estimated that between 3,755 and 4,155 people
remained in Croatia's devastated Krajina from a population of about
185,000.
Those who remained generally did so because they were too poor or too
old to join the refugee columns who made the arduous trek to Serbia.
Despite Croatian assurances that the rights of its Serbs would be
respected, uniformed men continue to terrorize Serbs in the Krajina.
"There is this rather macabre evidence of rubber gloves covered in
blood being found in the village and that perhaps suggests that some
sort of investigation has taken place," Gunness told reporters.
A woman in her 70s and 80s was believed to have witnessed at least some
of the killings, said Gunness. "She might well be vulnerable to
retaliation," he added.
Menacingly, local authorities turned away a man trying to visit
Varivode on September 28, the day of the killings.
"A man (was) trying ... to take bread to some people in the village and
he was told he couldn't go to the village because there had been an
accident and the people there no longer required the bread," said
Gunness.
