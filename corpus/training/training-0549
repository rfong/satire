Japan, Russia Agree to Start Peace Treaty Talks 
Japan and Russia today agreed to start talks for the final conclusion
of a bilateral peace treaty by the year of 2000, foreign ministry
officials said.
Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and his Russian counterpart
Yevgeny Primakov made the consensus at a regular meeting in Tokyo.
The talks will be held in January in Moscow at the vice foreign
ministerial level.
Earlier this month, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin decided at an informal summit meeting
in Krasnoyarsk, eastern Siberia, to make utmost efforts to sign a peace
treaty by the year of 2000.
Japan and Russia have not yet sign a peace treaty for more five decades
mainly due to a territorial dispute over a chain of Russian-held
islands off northern Japan.
