Tennis Welcomes Silent Letter Era
At the Australian Open tennis championship, we witnessed the dawn of a
new era-the era of the silent letter powerhouses, at least according to
Roger Federer, or Roger Dfederer, as he now likes to be known.
"Rafa (Nadal) and I were discussing this after we were both crushed in
the semi's by Tsonga and Djokovic respectively", began Dfederer. "We
couldn't find a single reason why those two jokers beat us, but then it
hit home-both those kids have one thing in common-the presence of an
awkward, silent and/or completely unnecessary letter in their name;
that's when Rafa and I realised that there was only one way to continue
our dominance; that's why he's now known as Rafa Tnadal and I as Roger
Dfederer".
Others have been quick to follow suit, with Andy Murray now known as
Randy Murray, James Blake as James Blcake and Roddick as Roddlick.
Murray, who crashed in round one of the Aussie Open, was particularly
pleased: "I feel the silent 'R' was the way ta go fer me because I'm a
randy bugger who likes big-breasted bimbos oiled with chocolate syrup.
Also, I didn't want to run into Youzhny, Gasquet, Monfils or Berdych at
a tournament and have them start wi' an unfair advantage."
Andy Roddlick says his chances of grabbing another major have seriously
improved with the introduction of a new letter: "When you think about
it, it makes perfect sense. Look at past winners-LLEYTON Hewitt, right?
There's like an 'L' there which is totally self-indulgent and the guy
won two grand slams! And I'm sure there's more. Wait, Lendl!? No, no,
that doesn't really work. But it still makes perfect sense. I'm a
contender again, baby! Yeah!"
Every player bar one on the main tour has now adopted a silent, latent
letter in their moniker. The exception?
"Guillermo Coria", explained an ATP official yesterday. "He knows that,
stupid silent letter or not, he's gonna be losing for a considerable
time to come".
