UN Welcomes Efforts by FRY, Croatia in Solving 
The United Nations Security Council on Tuesday welcomed and expressed
support for the process of bilateral negotiations between the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and the Republic of Croatia to settle the
disputed issue of Prevlaka by peaceful means.
The move came after the Security Council reviewed U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's latest report on the situation in
Prevlaka, the peninsula in the southeast of Croatia.
The Council called upon the parties to intensify their efforts to
settle the issue by peaceful means as provided for in the agreement on
normalization of relations between the two countries of 1996.
The Council reaffirmed the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
croatia within its internationally recognized borders and expressed the
hope that discussions on Prevlaka would lead to a resolution of the
question as soon as possible.
The Council expressed its appreciation for the continued efforts of the
U.N. Mission of Observers in Prevlaka to provide for stability in the
area and to create an atmosphere conducive to a negotiated settlement.
