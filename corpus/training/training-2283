S. Africa Approves 107 Million Rand Cash for Legal 
South African Parliament's Finance Portfolio Committee (PFPC) Wednesday
approved a much-needed 107 million rand cash injection for the Legal
Aid Board (LAB), the Citizen newspaper reported Thursday.
According to newly-appointed LAB Chairman Justice Mahomed Navsa, the
board has its debts accumulated to 428 million rand and needs 107
million rand in order to function and meet its obligations.
Although a marked improvement has been made in the processing of claims
since he took control of the board, there is still a huge backlog,
Navsa added.
Rates paid to lawyers for appearances in the High Court have been
reduced to 750 rand a day, which is significantly lower than the
previous figure of up to 3,000 rand a day.
However, the decision is still to be endorsed by the National Assembly,
Navsa said.
