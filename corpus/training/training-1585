1,200 missing in Borneo ethnic unrest: student group 
Around 1,200 people are missing in the troubled Indonesian province of
West Kalimantan following more than two months of ethnic unrest there,
a student group said according to reports Tuesday.
The Indonesian Youth Forum (FKPI), consisting of eight Moslem, Catholic
and Protestant student groups, said that its figures were based on a
fact-finding mission on February 7-14.
One member of the mission, Leopold Sudaryono, was quoted by the
Republika daily as saying that the estimate was based on a survey of
destroyed villages along a stretch of 60 to 70 kilometres (46 miles)
north of the province's capital of Pontianak and on the number of
refugees.
"We emphasize that they (the 1,200 people) are missing, not dead,"
Sudaryono said.
But he acknowledged it was difficult to determine whether those missing
have simply fled their villages or have died.
West Kalimantan Governor Aspar Aswin said last week that around 200
people have died in the violent clashes between the indigenous Dayak
people and migrants from Madura, an island north of Java, since late
December.
