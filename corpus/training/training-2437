Li, Koji Seal Relay Wins for China and Japan 
Li Xuemei and Koji Ito, winners in the women's and men's 100 meters
respectively, anchored vicotries for their countries in the 4x100m
relays here on Tuesday at the Asian Games.
Li, who retained her 100m title on Monday, led the Chinese women's
quartet to the win in 43.36 seconds.
Uzbekistan finished second in 44.38 and Thailand third in 44.68.
"I stayed in hospital for the whole last night," said Li, who suffered
a fever and stomach complaint on Sunday.
"I'm very weak but very confident to win," she said. "We are much
stronger than the others."
Koji, who set a new Asian record of 10.00 seconds in the men's 100m
semifinals and stormed to the gold medal in 10.05, sealed the win for
the Japanese foursome in 38.91.
Thailand came second in 39.17 and Qatar third in 39.85.
Igor Potapovich of Kazakhstan, who holds the Asian record of 5.90
meters, also regained his title in the men's pole vault which he won in
Hiroshima four years ago.
Potapovich, who won the World Indoor Championships last year, cleared
5.55 meters for the gold, followed by Kim Chul-Kyun of South Korea
(5.40) and Kobayashi Fumiaki of Japan (5.20).
"It's a very tough to retain the title," the 31-year-old said. "Because
it's a bit cold and windy and most importantly it's off season at home
and I'm training for next year's World Championships."
He hoped to beat the all-time great Sergey Bubka of Ukraine to become
the second world champion.
"It's not impossible," he said. "Everything can happen in the field."
Potapovich said he had beaten Bubka for several times but declined to
say when he had won over the six-time world champion.
"It has become history. I don't want to think of it," he said.
Li Meisu took her second gold medal in the women's shot put event in
her second Asian Games after 16 years.
Li, 39, who had set 11 Asian records between 1984 and 1988, met no
trouble to grab the gold with a shot of 18.96 meters, her best in 1998.
Her teammate Cheng Xiaoyan won the silver in 18.55 and Juthaporn
Krasaeyan took the bronze in 18.24.
Li, mother of a five-year-old boy, said that she was not willing to
return to the field after her retirement in 1988.
"A lot of friends and officials asked me to come back," she said. "I
only want to take care of my child and family."
She admitted it's unfortunate for China to have only one Li Meisu.
"After so many years, no shot putter is better than I am," she said.
Li, who holds the Asian record of 21.76 meters, won a bronze in the
Seoul Olympic Games, the first ever Olympic medal taken by a Chinese
woman athlete from the track and field.
The men's 3,000m steeple-chase gold went to Japan's Uchitomi Yasunori,
who hit the tape in 8:41.00.
H. Sajdjadi-Hazaveh and Jafar Babakhani, both of Iran, took the silver
and bronze respectively in 8:42.53 and 8:55.04.
In the men's long jump, Masaki Morinaga of Japan jumped to a winning
distance of 8.10 meters to claim the top honour, while Liu Hongning of
China took the silver at 8.05 meters with the bronze medal taken away
by A. Faraj of Qatar.
