Kidnapped French Released in Somalia 
Two French nationals kidnapped by gunmen in the northeastern coast of
Somalia were released Monday after 52 days of captivity in a small
village controlled by the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF)
faction.
Reports reaching here said the release of the hostages were resulted
from pressure by politicians and clan elders. The elders told reporters
that the release was unconditional despite the repetitive demand made
by the gunmen for a ransom of 75,000 US Dollars.
However, some unconfirmed reports said at least 50,000 U.S. Dollars had
been paid to secure the safe release of the hostages.
The elders who disassociated themselves from being members of the
disputed autonomous administration which was announced Thursday in
Garowe district, northeast Somalia, said the French tourists are now
healthy and good looking.
However, according to the report, the elders did not say a word about a
yacht the French men were travelling on to the Reunion island
controlled by France near Madagascar.
The efforts for the release of the French men came after one of the
hostages became terribly sick and the other started fasting from all
kinds of food for three days in protest against their continued
abduction.
This had resulted after the gunmen moved the French men to Buro
village, 45 km east of the port town of Bossaso in the middle of last
month, where access of vehicles was difficult.
The elders were supported by the United Nations and European Union
offices in Bossaso for securing the release.
