Rodman Expected To Return To Spurs For Kings Game 
Dennis Rodman was expected to suit up and possibly play for the San
Antonio Spurs on Friday night against the Sacramento Kings, team
officials said.
Rodman has not played since separating his right shoulder in a
motorcycle accident March 19. The Spurs confirmed Thursday that Rodman
would be taken off the injured list and be in uniform for Friday's
game.
Rodman took park in an optional workout with several teammates Thursday
afternoon.
``I definitely think it (Rodman's return) comes at the right time,''
forward Sean Elliott said. ``We will be excited to see him back in the
lineup and see him playing.''
The Spurs continued a 15-game winning streak with Rodman out, but they
lost consecutive games this week to Portland and Phoenix.
Rodman is averaging 7.3 points and a league-leading 17.4 rebounds per
game.
