One American IFOR soldier was killed and another injured in a traffic
accident Friday evening near Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia, Tanjug news
agency said today.
This is the second U.S. fatality in Bosnia.
The injured soldier was transported to a nearby military hospital, but

The two soldiers' vehicle collided with a truck near Gornje Babine
Friday evening when the weather was bad and the road was muddy and
slippery, Tanjug quoted an American official as saying.

Implementation Force (IFOR) which oversees the implementation of the
Bosnia peace accords.
