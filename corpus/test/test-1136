A senior official of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
hailed the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to the
DPRK as a historic one.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Paek Nam Sun made the statement during his
talks with Albright.
Paek also congratulated Albright on her meeting with Kim Jong Il, the
top leader of the DPRK, on her first day visit here.
Kim accompanies Albright to watch a mass performance and held a banquet
in her honor on the same day.
Present at the talks were vice DPRK foreign minister Kim Gye Gwan, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth and other high ranking U.S.
officials.
Albright, the first U.S. cabinet member ever to visit this country,
arrived here Monday for a two-day landmark visit to prepare for a
possible trip by President Bill Clinton to the DPRK.
