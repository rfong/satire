Earlier, former England batsman David Gower, who scored more than 8,000
runs in Test matches before retiring to pursue a media career, said he
had known Botham and Lamb for years and they were not racists.
Shown video footage of himself, Botham and Lamb looking at the ball
during the 1982 series, he thought it looked as though Botham was
repairing the ball.
"Knowing Ian's thumbs - not intimately - but knowing them, I think he's
pushing the ball back and my view is you are allowed to do that."
He had never seen Botham tampering with the ball.
Cross-examined by Mr Carman, Gower agreed that Imran had sent him the
same conciliatory letter he had sent Botham and Lamb after the
appearance of a biography in which "negative comments" were attributed
to him.
Gower agreed that he had written, in reply: "Fear not. You have no need
to worry about the comments", and assured Imran that he was not hurt.
He agreed with comments by England cricket captain, Mike Atherton, that
bowlers had "succumbed" to the temptation of ball tampering many a
time, but it was not right that everyone was doing it.
Mike Atherton, accompanied by English cricket coach David Lloyd, took
their seats in court as Gower said that ball tampering was not accepted
by the game as a whole, and that virtually every player would like to
see the laws upheld.
