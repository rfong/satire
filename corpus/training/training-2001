Chinese Premier's Prescription(2)
-- Consumer spending should be increased by increasing incomes of urban
and rural people, with special attention being paid to the large number
of medium and low-income people and the large rural population.
Policies on increasing consumer loans must be formulated as soon as
possible.
-- Exports should be increased by taking steps to attract more foreign
investment and to use it effectively. Foreign investment should be
allowed in a wider range of fields and policies that adversely affect
foreign investment should be adjusted and services for foreign-funded
enterprises in China should be significantly improved.
-- Reforms of SEOs are to be carried out according to recent
instructions from President Jiang Zemin. The process of modernizing
their management must be sped up and burdens on enterprises need to be
eased to reach the goal of revamping large and medium-sized SEOs by the
end of next year.
-- The 9-year compulsory education system must be implemented and
high-school, vocational, and higher education need to be encouraged to
make education a lucrative business, to stimulate the growth of related
fields, and to benefit society in the long run.
Zhu told those gathered that they should have a clear idea about the

problems. He said he himself is confident about the prospect.
