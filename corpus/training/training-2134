European Commission confirm balls investigation 
The European Commission confirmed here on Tuesday they had launched an
inquiry into alleged restrictive practices over ball contracts after it
was revealed that English football's governing body, the Football
Association, had had its offices searched.
The team of four -- two from the directorate-general of competition and
two from the Office of Fair Trading -- arrived at the London offices
without warning.
The inspectors have the authority to inspect and seize any documents
that could prove helpful to their investigation.
The inquiry was launched on the back of 'numerous complaints' from ball
manufacturers and retailers ahead of a FIFA executive committee meeting
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
They complained that a FIFA levy of two Swiss francs for a match ball
and one swiss franc for a training ball were prohibitive.
They also complained that national federations which insisted on having
the FIFA logo on the ball for official internationals robbed them of
marketing openings.
The English, French, Danish and Luxembourg federations were said to be
the main offenders.
In London an FA spokesman said: "They are seeking access to all the
offices within the building. They apparently have the authority to
inspect a wide range of documents and are attempting to interview
members of staff."
Among offices they wished to search were those of chief executive
Graham Kelly, coach Terry Venables, and the commercial department.
"They are being accompanied around the place by our lawyer. To say we
are shocked and surprised is an understatement. It's effectively the
equivalent of being raided by somebody with a search warrant. It's
extraordinary and quite unnecessary, we believe."
