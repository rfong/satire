Italian priest excommunicated for performing gay marriages 
The Catholic Church has excommunicated an Italian priest for conducting
gay marriages, the Vatican said Thursday.
"The position of Father Franco Barbero in terms of morality and in the
celebration of the pseudo-marriages of homosexual people is in clear
and serious contrast with the doctrine of the Catholic Church," Bishop
Pier Giorgio Bernardi said in announcing Barbero's excommunication.
Barbero had presided over 35 homosexual unions over the span of several
years, Bernardi said, adding that church officials had tried in vain
for 30 years to convince the 63-year-old priest to change his ways.
Barbero has also written 13 books on homosexuality and contributed to
the Italian website www.gay.it.
Barbero's last act was to preside over the marriage of two women, where
he said, "these lesbian women, our sisters, ask the Christian church to
change its doctrine."
Bernardi said Barbero had "denied the principal mysteries of the
Christian faith, notably the virginity of the Virgin Mary."
"If we hadn't publicly excommunicated him until now, it was because
Father Barbero had already put himself outside his communion with the
Catholic Church," he said.
