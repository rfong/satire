Ukraine Keen to Join CIS Customs Union 
Ukraine was keen to become a member of the customs union of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) but had no intention of
joining any military blocs, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said
today.
In remarks before leaving for the CIS summit, to be held in Moscow on
Friday, the president also stressed that Russia would be one of
Ukraine's major partners in the future.
He described as "positive" the results of his Tuesday meeting with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, during which Yeltsin said he planned
to visit Ukraine in March.
The two presidents also signed an agreement on the formation of a joint
commission for cooperation, to be headed by the prime ministers of the
two countries.
