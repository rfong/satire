Dollar firms against yen in Tokyo 
The dollar was slightly firmer against the yen Wednesday after
resisting a push below 132 yen earlier in the day, with a lack of
strong enough leads to push the cross out of its recent range, dealers
said.
The greenback traded at 132.28 yen at 10:50 am (0150 GMT) against
132.15-17 yen in New York and 132.36-39 yen in Tokyo late Tuesday.
A rise on the Nikkei-225 stock index in the morning helped support the
yen after losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday but
investors were uncertain over whether the gains could be sustained,
said dealers.
The key index ended the early session up 1.5 percent at 11,516.46
points.
Japanese stocks have been helped by tightening of short-selling rules
by the government, forcing investors to cover their short positions in
major issues.
The initial panic buying on the introduction of the new rules was
accelerated by fund managers, who jumped on the bandwagon after sharp
gains.
"The Nikkei is a little bit stronger than expected even today.
Yesterday's Dow Jones lost ground and people had expected the same
here," said Kosuke Hanao, head of foreign exchange sales at Royal Bank
of Scotland.
"The point is whether this level (of the Nikkei) is sustainable without
price-keeping operations," Hanao said, referring to further government
action aimed at supporting the market.
"On the other hand, global investors are underweight the Nikkei and
overweight the US. The best performance this year is the Nikkei and the
worst is Nasdaq so people are a little bit nervous," he said.
Equity fund managers will be forced to buy Japanese stocks to avoid
falling sharply below benchmark indices against which their performance
is judged.
"Real-money accounts have to buy stocks and so have to buy yen," Hanao
said.
Although the dollar may eventually make a break for downside technical
support at around 131.80 yen -- after falling temporarily below this
level last night -- it is likely to remain within a long-term range of
130-135 yen.
"We cannot expect a very rapid movement," Hanao said.
US non-manufacturing data released overnight reaffirmed the recovery in
the economy there, while fourth quarter capital expenditure data from
Japan, with a 14.5 percent fall year-on-year, showed the Japanese
economy is weak.
"But the point is these figures are almost discounted in the market,"
Hanao said.
Meanwhile, the euro bought 0.8707 dollars, against 0.8718-20 dollars in
New York and 0.8695-98 dollars in Tokyo late Tuesday.
Against the yen, the euro was quoted at 115.18, compared with 115.24 in
New York and 115.07 in Tokyo Tuesday afternoon.
