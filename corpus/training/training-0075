Dollar increases gains as market waits for job figures 
The dollar gained more ground late Friday morning on the London foreign
exchange market as investors guessed the US employment figures to be
released at 1230 GMT would be better than expected.
The greenback was trading at the end of the morning at 91.10 yen, its
highest level against the Japanese currency since March 10. It also
stood at 1.2965 German marks.
