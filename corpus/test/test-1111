Mayor in Italy's Sicilia Arrested on Mafia Charges 
A Sicilian mayor who recently railed against the authorities for
allowing his town to languish in the grips of the Mafia, has been
arrested on charges of Mafia association, vote buying, drug trafficking
and blackmail, Italian news agency Ansa reported Monday.
Giuseppe Intelisano, the mayor of Calatabiano near Catania on the
eastern Sicilian coast, was arrested Sunday night along with 49 others,
including Catania provincial councilor Alfio Lizzio, as part of an
anti-Mafia swoop.
According to investigators, both Intelisano and Lizzio granted favors
to a local Mafia clan in exchange for votes, the favors ranging from
money and public works contracts to cheap petrol and even the promotion
of football players.
In particular, Lizzio is charged with having paid 30 million lire to
the clan in return for its support during local elections in 1998.
The others arrested were accused of a range of crimes, including
murder, theft, extortion and blackmail.
Investigators said that more local political officials could be
implicated in the inquiry.
