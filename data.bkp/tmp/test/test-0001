Sampras/NNS ,/, Chang/VBG advance/NN to/TO Salem/NNP Open/IN final/JJ World/NNP number/NN two/CD Pete/NNP Sampras/NNP and/CC fellow/JJ Sampras/NNS ,/, who/WP on/IN Saturday/NNP defeated/VBD Dutchman/NNP Jan/NNP Siemerink/NNP 6-3/CD ,/, 4-6/CD ,/, 7-6/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 7-2/CD -RRB-/-RRB- in/IN his/PRP$ semi-final/NN ,/, is/VBZ hoping/VBG to/TO unseat/JJ current/JJ world/NN number/NN one/NN Austrian/NNP Thomas/NNP Muster/NNP by/IN winning/VBG the/DT title/NN ./.

Second-seeded/NNP Chang/NNP ,/, who/WP beat/VBD Australian/NNP Todd/NNP Woodbridge/NNP 6-3/CD ,/, 6-4/CD ,/, is/VBZ aiming/VBG for/IN his/PRP$ third/JJ consecutive/JJ title/NN in/IN the/DT city/NN he/PRP treats/VBZ as/IN a/DT home/NN away/RB from/IN home/NN ./.

Sampras/NNS has/VBZ a/DT good/JJ chance/NN of/IN reclaiming/VBG the/DT number/NN one/CD ranking/NN ,/, depending/VBG on/IN how/WRB Muster/NNP performs/VBZ in/IN Estoril/NNP ./.

While/IN the/DT three-time/JJ Wimbledon/NNP champion/NN has/VBZ no/DT points/NNS to/TO defend/VB this/DT week/NN ,/, Muster/NNP will/MD lose/VB 359/CD points/NNS and/CC is/VBZ only/RB 72/CD ahead/RB of/IN Sampras/NNP in/IN the/DT latest/JJS rankings/JJ list/NN ./.

But/CC Sampras/NNP '/POS mind/NN will/MD be/VB on/IN winning/VBG rather/RB than/IN the/DT rankings/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB thinking/VBG about/IN it/PRP much/RB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` If/IN I/PRP get/VBP it/PRP in/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP ,/, great/JJ ,/, otherwise/RB I/PRP will/MD go/VB on/RP to/TO Tokyo/NNP and/CC try/VB and/CC get/VB it/PRP there/RB ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN rankings/NNS ,/, what/WP happens/VBZ at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN shows/NNS who/WP is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS player/NN ./. ''/''

Chang/NN will/MD certainly/RB have/VB the/DT crowd/NN on/IN his/PRP$ side/NN ,/, as/IN Australian/NNP Woodbridge/NNP grugingly/RB testified/VBD ./.

Woodbridge/NNP ,/, the/DT sixth/JJ seed/NN and/CC ranked/NN 27th/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, bemoaned/VBD the/DT partisan/JJ support/NN for/IN Chang/NNP ,/, which/WDT he/PRP felt/VBD went/VBD over/IN the/DT top/NN on/IN many/JJ occasions/NNS ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ horrendous/VBG playing/VBG him/PRP in/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Woodbridge/NNP ./.

``/`` How/WRB many/JJ times/NNS do/VBP you/PRP make/VB an/DT error/NN and/CC they/PRP cheer/NN ?/.

``/`` I/PRP enjoy/VBP playing/VBG in/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP ,/, but/CC not/RB against/IN Chang/NNP ./.

It/PRP happens/VBZ in/IN Davis/NNP Cup/NNP ,/, but/CC you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB it/PRP to/TO happen/VB in/IN tournaments/NNS ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB really/RB great/JJ when/WRB you/PRP make/VBP an/DT error/NN because/IN they/PRP are/VBP happier/JJR than/IN when/WRB you/PRP make/VBP a/DT really/RB great/JJ shot/NN ./. ''/''

Chang/NN said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD grateful/JJ to/TO play/VB in/IN front/NN of/IN good/JJ support/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT crowd/NN here/RB I/PRP think/VBP is/VBZ relatively/RB fair/JJ ,/, ''/'' said/VBD world/NN number/NN four/CD Chang/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT majority/NN of/IN them/PRP are/VBP behind/IN me/PRP and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ if/IN I/PRP was/VBD in/IN Australia/NNP the/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT crowd/NN would/MD be/VB behind/IN him/PRP ./. ''/''
