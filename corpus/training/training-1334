Japanese, South Korean Foreign Ministers Hold Talks 
Visiting South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Hong Soon
Young and Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura held talks Monday
to exchange views on a wide range of issues.
The two ministers reaffirmed the agreement reached between the two
countries during South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's state visit to
Japan last October to build up a "new partnership toward the 21st
century."
Among specific undertakings, they agreed to start full-fledged
negotiations next month toward concluding a bilateral investment
treaty, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.
As tangible cooperation between Japan and South Korea, Hong and Komura
agreed to set up a hot line between their foreign ministries and to
conduct joint rescue drills in October between their maritime police
authorities following a similar exercise recently staged by their naval
forces, the official said.
Hong, who arrived here on Sunday for a three-day visit to Japan, also
met with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Chief Cabinet
Secretary Hiromu Nonaka later in the day.
During his meeting with Hong, Nonaka sought to allay concerns in South
Korea that Japan might be moving politically to the right, the official
said.
"We will continue to keep in mind the time in history when we caused
trouble to the people of China and the Korean Peninsula, and will also
make efforts from the point of view that Japan's peace, security and
prosperity should be achieved within the peace, security and prosperity
of the region," Nonaka was quoted as saying.
Japan's recognition of the Hinomaru as the national flag and "
Kimigayo" as the national anthem, two sensitive symbols for their links
to the country's imperial system and wartime militarism, as well as a
proposal to look into allowing official visits to Yasukuni Shrine
dedicated to Japan's war dead, have raised concerns in its neighboring
Asian countries, including South Korea.
