Nepali Congress Closer to Clear Majority in Polls 
The Nepali Congress inched closer Thursday to a clear majority in the
205-seat House of Representatives as it has bagged 96 of the 173
declared seats on the fourth day of vote counting.
The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML)
remained the runner-up with 60 seats. The National Democratic Party
(RPP) came third with 8, the Nepal Sadbhavana Party with 4, the
National People's Front with 3, and the Nepal Workers and Peasants
Party and the United People's Front with one each, the Nepal Television
said Thursday night.
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML) and the RPP
(Chand), which broke away from the CPN-UML and the RPP respectively
early last year, have not won a single seat yet so far.
RPP (Chand)'s parliamentary leader and former prime minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand was declared defeated Thursday.
CPN-ML President Sahana Pradhan, General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam and
the party's two other influential leaders Chandra Prakash Mainali and
Radha Krishna Mainali and RPP (Chand) President Rajeswor Devkota all
lost.
Gautam's last chance rests in the No. 1 constituency of Kathmandu where
voting is rescheduled for June 8 following the death of CPN-UML
candidate Man Mohan Adhikari.
The CPN-ML and the RPP (Chand) are not recognized as national parties
yet. They have to win at least three percent of the total votes cast
for the status.
Vote counting started Monday evening after the second-phase
parliamentary elections concluded. The first-phase elections were held
on May 3.
Palten Gurung from the Nepali Congress was declared elected unopposed
on March 30 as he was the only candidate to file nomination in Manang
district, western Nepal.
