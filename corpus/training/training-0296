Bahrain to stage next Arab summit in 2003 
Manama will next year become the first Gulf capital to host an Arab
summit, a Bahraini official told AFP here Tuesday, the eve of a
gathering of Arab leaders in Lebanon.
"Bahrain will convene the next summit in Manama," in March 2003, said
the official with the delegation from the Gulf archipelago.
Arab leaders agreed at an emergency summit in Cairo in October 2000 to
hold summits annually with the 22 members of the Arab League taking
turns based on the Arabic-language alphabet.
Beirut was selected as this year's site after the United Arab Emirates,
the next in line as summit host, gave up its place in a sign of
solidarity.
