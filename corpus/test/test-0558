Zaire, Rwanda begin talks on refugees by Christian Spillmann 
Government delegations from Zaire and Rwanda embarked here Sunday on
two days of talks on the crisis sparked by the cross-border exodus of
more than a million Rwandan refugees, officials said.
The talks got under way at around 4:00 p.m. (1400 GMT), half an hour
after the Rwandan delegation arrived in this Zairean border town around
which the bulk of the refugees are concentrated.
The 14-member Rwandan government team made a tension-filled crossing of
the border after Zairean frontier guards refused to allow the
delegates' armed Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) escort to enter Goma
with their weapons, correspondents reported.
Zairean Defence Minister Admiral Mavua Mudima and Justice Minister
Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda had arrived in Goma earlier in the day.
The talks, which are due to continue until Monday, are focusing on ways
to encourage the refugees to return home, security problems and the
activities of Rwanda's former Hutu-led government army inside Zaire.
They could also lay the basis for a summit meeting of heads of
government, said the Zairean defence ministry spokesman, Lieutenant
Colonel Henri Ngoma.
"The problem is that one cannot force people to return home if they do
not want to," he added.
A member of the Rwandan delegation said Interior Minister Seth
Sendashonga might visit Goma Tuesday.
More than a million Rwandans have sought refuge in neighbouring Zaire
in the last two months, around Goma and Bukavu respectively north and
south of Lake Kivu, including members of the former government and
nearly 30,000 soldiers of the defeated army.
Some of the soldiers have resumed training at a camp near Bukavu,
according to aid groups there.
Many of the mainly Hutu refugees refuse to return to Rwanda, now
governed by the Tutsi-led RPF, fearing retribution for ethnic massacres
of Tutsis by the former government army and hardline Hutu militias and
intimidation by their own refugee leaders.
Troops from the ousted Rwandan army have also indicated that they would
be ready to return to Rwandan only if they could be guaranteed safety
and allowed to join the new army.
Meanwhile two Rwandan immigration officers arrived over the weekend at
the Ruzizi I border post near Zaire and began controlling access into
the country.
Their arrival marked the first visible presence of the new Kigali
administration in the humanitarian safety zone recently evacuated by
French troops in southwest Rwanda.
On Saturday soldiers of the new Rwanda Patriotic Army shot dead one man
and detained three others from a convoy of 300 refugees returning to
their homes from Kibuye, in the safety zone.
Major Jean-Guy Plante of the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Rwanda said the incident happened at the first checkpoint just outside
the safety zone.
The person tried to flee as he was being interrogated and between 10
and 15 soldiers gave chase and a lot of rounds were heard before the
soldiers returned to report that they had killed the man.
The refugees were in five trucks of a UN British convoy which had
delivered food aid to Kibuye and picked up refugees willing to return
to their homes.
Plante said UNAMIR was investigating the incident but could not
interfere as the man was shot outside the humanitarian zone.
