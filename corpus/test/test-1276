Indigenous death rate in Australia far outstrips average figures 
Death rates among indigenous Australians are up to four times higher
than for the Australian population as a whole, a report published here
Wednesday said.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics and Australian Institute of Health
and Welfare report showed that between 1992 and 1994 indigenous -- or
Aboriginal -- women were four times more likely to die at any given age
than Australians as a whole.
In the period 1992-1994 the total deaths of indigenous Australians was
3,317 -- 1,883 men and 1,434 women.
The death rate for men was 3.5 times that of the Australian population.
Indigenous women were 17 times, and indigenous men 15 times, more
likely to die from homicide, while suicide rates for indigenous men
were almost twice as high as for the rest of the population.
The greatest difference in mortality between indigenous and
non-indigenous people was for the 25 to 54 age group, the report
stated, with death rates five to seven times higher.
The latest -- 1994 -- population figures show a total Australian
population of 18,238,000, of which 303,300 are Aboriginal or Torres
Strait Islanders.
The report is based largely on mortality rates in the states of Western
Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, due to problems
in obtaining accurate information on indigenous death rates in other
states.
Breast cancer and suicide in women and prostate cancer in men were the
only areas where indigenous people had lower mortality rates.
The greatest cause of indigenous deaths was circulatory problems
followed by respiratory diseases, neoplasms, nutritional problems and
poisoning.
Diabetes, digestive system diseases and mental disorders accounted for
about five percent, four percent and three percent respectively of
deaths.
Alcohol abuse was considered to be a factor in many deaths, the report
said.
