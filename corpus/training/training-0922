Marchibroda out as Colts' coach 
Ted Marchibroda, who coached the Indianapolis Colts to the American
Conference Championship game this season, will not return after turning
down a one-year contract offer Thursday.
Ted Marchibroda jnr, who acts as his father's agent, said his father
was not asked back during a brief meeting Thursday with Colts Director
of Football Operations Bill Tobin.
"His goal was to create a family atmosphere with the Indianapolis
Colts," said the younger Marchibroda about his father on the Sports Fan
Radio Network's Bob Golic Show. "He loved Indianapolis and was thrilled
to have the year he did."
Marchibroda jnr held a news conference Thursday evening to announce his
father's departure. Team officials did not attend and the club has
declined to comment on the matter.
Marchibroda was upset that the Colts had not offered him a multi-year
deal on the heels of a successful 1995 season. Tobin said on Wednesday
that Marchibroda would not be offered a multi-year deal.
The Colts finished 9-7 and captured a wild card playoff berth in 1995.
Indianapolis beat San Diego 35-20 in the wild card round and upset
Kansas City 10-7 in the divisional playoffs before losing in the AFC
Championship Game to Pittsburgh, 20-16.
The Colts just lost defensive coordinator Vince Tobin, who was named
the new head coach of the Arizona Cardinals Wednesday. Tobin is the
brother of Bill Tobin.
The 64-year-old Marchibroda has coached Indianapolis the last four
years and has compiled a 32-35 record.
Marchibroda previously served as head coach of the-then Baltimore Colts
from 1975-79. He had a 41-36 record in his first term as Colts' coach
and led the team to three AFC East titles.
