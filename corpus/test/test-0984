Iran Seeks Investments in Mining and Metal Sector 
Iranian Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq Jahangiri said here on
Tuesday that Iran is determined to seek foreign investments to boost
the country's mining and metal sector.
Jahangiri told the First Seminar on International Investments in Mining
and Metal Sector that his ministry will offer over 100 mining and
industrial projects and 15 exploration projects to foreign and domestic
companies.
He said the total investments for the projects will exceed 10 billion
U.S. dollars, adding that among the mining and industrial projects, 25
are related to steel, 12 to copper, 13 to aluminum, 7 to lead and zinc,
9 to ferroalloy and 40 to mining and chemical industries.
The minister said he believes that the development of mining and metal
sector will help the country boost non-oil exports and reduce
dependence on oil incomes.
Deputy Minister of Mines and Metals for Economic and International
Affairs Mohammad Javad Assemipour said last week that contracts for
four projects will be signed at the seminar and six unfinished projects
will also be presented to domestic and international investors.
Representatives from 50 foreign and 100 domestic companies are
participating the two-day seminar.
In accordance with the country's law, international companies can
invest up to 100 percent of the projects' value, Assemipour said, but
it is expected that most international companies will enter into joint
venture with domestic firms with shares standing at 30-50 percent of
total investment.
