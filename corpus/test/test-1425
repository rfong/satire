Russian parliament rejects draft budget at first reading
Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, rejected the
government's austere 1997 draft budget at a first reading Friday,
dismissing its spending and revenue predictions as unrealistic.
Deputies voted to reject the finance bill, which aims to halve annual
inflation and trim the budget deficit, by 280 in favour with 33 against
and four abstentions. But they could not agree on what to do next with
the draft text.
Communist deputies moved for the finance bill to be sent back to the
government for revision, but the chamber rejected the motion.
Pro-government and nationalist deputies proposed the formation of a
broadly-based committee of deputies and ministers to work out a
compromise, but the chamber also rejected that motion.
"For the first time we have a budget as precise as it is early, but
that is the only positive point," said Mikhail Zadornov, the head of
the parliament's budget committee.
"All predictions of budget revenue are based on the experience of 1995
and do not take into account the catastrophic situation of 1996," he
said. "It doesn't give an impression of economic growth. It is a budget
of survival."
Deputies will meet again on Monday to decide what to do next with the
draft budget.
The austerity bill, continuing the tough policies carried out by Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin during the past two years, is aimed at
cutting inflation to around 10 percent for 1997, and reining in the
budget deficit to little more than three percent of gross domestic
product (GDP).
The bill envisages increasing public spending to 524.3 trillion rubles
(97 billion dollars) and boosting revenues to 433.64 trillion rubles
(80.3 billion dollars). The deficit is to be financed by government
borrowing.
But deputies have remained sceptical over the government's ability to
collect the necessary revenue to finance its spending plans.
According to projections for 1996, the government will bring in only
some 65 percent of revenues set out in the budget. Widespread tax
evasion is mainly to blame for the shortfall.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said on public radio earlier Friday
that he would crack down on tax fraud in a bid to boost the budget and
enable the government to spend more on pensions and salaries for
struggling public sector workers.
"Tax evasion has become a vice, above all by enterprises and large
commercial structures," Yeltsin said, announcing the formation of a
special emergency committee to crack down on tax dodgers.
"Those who are avoiding taxes are condemning pensioners, the army,
science and cultural workers to a semi-destitute existence," he said.
Yeltsin's comments were echoed during the budget reading in parliament
by Finance Minister Alexander Livshits, who urged deputies to work with
the government to agree a final text for the finance bill.
"We can resolve the principal problems with rigorous policies," he
said, expressing the government's hope for "constructive cooperation
with the Duma to improve the budget."
But Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said the government should review
its budget, arguing that the current bill had been drawn up before the
formation of the current government after June-July presidential
elections.
The new government "must take two or three more weeks to put forward
new proposals," Zyuganov told the chamber.
Alexander Shokhin of the pro-government Our Home Is Russia bloc said a
cross-party committee of deputies and ministers should be formed to
pilot the budget through, a proposal supported by Chernomyrdin.
But both options were rejected by deputies in the parliament, leaving
the budget temporarily in limbo.
The bill has two further readings to pass through the Russian
parliament.
