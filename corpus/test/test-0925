Life Sentence for Surviving Gunman in Deadly Store Takeover 
A jury recommended life in prison, not death, for one of four gunman
who held 38 people hostage in a store for eight hours, then killed
three hostages when police burst in.
Loi Khac Nguyen, 25, was convicted in February of murder, attempted
murder, assault and kidnapping. Sentencing is scheduled for May 24, but
the judge is bound by the jury's verdict.
Nguyen is the sole surviving gunman from the 1991 electronics store
takeover. Two of his brothers and a friend died were killed when
authorities stormed The Good Guys store where they were holding
employees and customers hostage.
Before police burst in, one of Nguyen's brothers shot three bound
hostages to death, officers said, but prosecutors argued Nguyen was
legally responsible as the mastermind.
``We had no reason to think that he was a career criminal,'' said the
jury foreman, Christopher Draper.
In testimony during the penalty phase, defense lawyers focused on
Nguyen's harrowing life. His family lived in a refugee camp, then fled
Vietnam in 1979 and was attacked by pirates at sea.
Nguyen was pleased and relieved, defense lawyer Linda Parisi said,
adding that no decision had been made on appealing the conviction.
Deputy District Attorney Donald Steed wasn't surprised by the verdict.
``I would have liked to see a death verdict, but I can certainly see
why or how they could have reached this verdict,'' he said.
