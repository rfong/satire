California Governor to Launch Presidential Nomination Bid 
California Governor Pete Wilson announced today that he would formally
launch a bid for the Republican presidential nomination next Monday at
the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.
Wilson made the announcement at a party celebrating his 62nd birthday
held at his presidential campaign headquarters here in the nation's
capital.
He told his supporters that the issues which helped his second term as
governor -- including illegal immigration and public safety -- are
reverberating across the nation.
"In order to increase individual freedom and individual opportunity,
the time has come to shrink government and to expand the ability of
Americans to be all that they can be," United Press International
quoted Wilson as saying.
Although the Wilson campaign so far lacks significant national
recognition, recent polls have shown that support for the governor is
edging up.
