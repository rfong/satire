New futures exchange opens in Shanghai 
The Shanghai Commodities Exchange (SCE), formed through the merger of
four futures exchanges, is expected to open in March, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
The four exchanges making up the SCE are the Shanghai Petroleum
Exchange, the Shanghai Building Materials Exchange, the Shanghai
Agricultural Materials Exchange and the Shanghai Chemical Exchange.
The Shanghai Star bi-weekly reported that the first 15 contracts on the
SCE included various oils, rubber, urea, cotton yarn, raw silk and
plywood futures.
More than 400 firms and institutions had applied to be members of the
255-seat exchange which already had 217 members, the report said.
The SCE would conduct trading through a computer network and set up a
specialised company to handle trade clearing, the first local futures
exchange to do so, the report said.
The merger resulted from tighter control of the Chinese futures market
following a government investigation of more than 40 futures exchanges
in the middle of last year following fluctuations in prices.
Most of the exchanges were subsequently closed while 11 were allowed to
remain open as experimental exchanges, and some were ordered to merge.
The constituent exchanges of the SCE recorded a total turnover of 300
billion yuan (35.7 billion dollars) last year.
Liu Hongru, the chairman of the watchdog China Securities Regulatory
Commission, has called for efforts to standardise and regulate futures
trading to ensure the four-year-old market's healthy and stable
development.
News reports Monday quoted Liu as saying that the futures market, which
recorded a total turnover of two trillion yuan last year, had been
developing blindly at a high speed.
