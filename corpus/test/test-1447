Thailand says a sad goodbye to popular primate 
Hundreds of mourners have attended a Buddhist funeral ceremony to bid
farewell to Thailand's best-known orang-utan, reports said Sunday.
The orang-utan Mike, who along with his family became hugely popular at
Lop Buri zoo, 153 kilometres (95 miles) north of Bangkok, was given
bathing rites as Buddhist monks chanted prayers to traditional music,
the Bangkok Post said.
The popular primate died Thursday, aged 17, after battling pneumonia
for two weeks.
"Mike was a big celebrity here. He became a symbol of Lop Buri
province, with which he became synonymous," one woman attending the
funeral was quoted as saying.
One of Lop Buri province's major tourist attractions is its large
population of monkeys, who live right alongside residents.
Vice-chairman of Lop Buri's municipal council said the province had
lost its "most effective PR tool", the Post reported.
Visitors Saturday reportedly packed into the zoo, which was decorated
in black and white, to attend the funeral and give moral support to
Mike's surviving two mates and three offspring.
Zoo director Colonel Samorn Sithandorn told the Nation his staff had
prepared black outfits for Mike's family, which they will wear for
seven days.
Mike was expected to be buried under a statue of his likeness in a
ceremony at the zoo on Sunday, reports said.
