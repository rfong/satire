Rousseau to Challenge Ceron in London Marathon
Pre-race favourite Dionisio Ceron of Mexico will be bidding for an
unprecedented hat-trick of wins in the 1996 London Marathon on Sunday.
But the diminutive ace of the long distance will be under pressure from
one of the most competitive fields in the 16-year history of the race.
Only eight runners have run under 2 hrs 8 mins in 88 years and Belgian
Vincent Rousseau has done it twice.
Rousseau, who is the second fastest European ever to run the distance,
believes a world record is still possible on Sunday.
The Belgian is looking to break the eight-year mark of 2hrs 6mins
50secs belonging to Ethiopia's Belayneh Dinsamo.
"It's difficult to say how fast we will run because there are a lot of
things to consider, but a very fast time is possible," said Rousseau.
Ceron finished 24 seconds ahead of Ethiopia's Abebe Mekkonen in the
1994 marathon and last year out ran Australian Steve Moneghetti to
achieve his personal best time of 2 hours 8 minutes 30 seconds.
But amongst the record field of 27,000, Ceron will face strong
opposition from Rousseau and some of the world's top runners who are
competing for places at the Olympic games in Atlanta.
A 100,000 pounds prize (about 150,000 dollars) is on offer for a world
best, with 25,000 pounds for anyone beating the course record of 2:8:16
set by Welshman Steve Jones in 1985.
Rousseau, who will not compete in Atlanta because it will be too hot
and humid, will be happy with the weather forecast for Sunday which is
expected to be around 17 degrees centigrade at mid-day.
Rousseau is the joint favourite for Sunday's race with Ceron but the
pair are not likely to have things all their own way.
Mexico's German Silva, who has won the New York marathon for the last
two years, returns to London with the aim of improving on his third
place in 1994.
