Japanese city remembers deadly 1995 quake; victims suffer joblessness 
Kobe on Thursday marked the anniversary of the 1995 earthquake that
killed more than 6,000 people and flattened huge tracts of the Japanese
city that is home to 1.47 million residents.
"That day, our most precious things were taken away in the blink of an
eye, and we were plunged into deep sorrow," said Toshizo Ido, governor
of Hyogo Prefecture, of which Kobe is the capital, at a memorial
ceremony.
"But there were moments when we did not lose our kindness and helped
and encouraged one another."
"With the lessons learned after the earthquake ... we will continue to
do our utmost to build Hyogo as a safe place to live," Ido said.
In ceremonies around the city -- roughly 430 kilomtres (270 miles),
southwest of Tokyo -- and surrounding areas, survivors of the quake
offered prayers at 5:46 am (2046 GMT Wednesday), the exact time the
quake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale struck.
The buildings and structures which collapsed under the force of the
tremor and resulting fires killed 6,432 people.
Seven years on, with renovated infrastructure and commercial buildings,
the city appears on the surface to have risen anew from the flames and
devastation.
But a survey of earthquake victims published to mark the sombre
anniversary showed 17 percent of households affected by the quake still
reported having some members who are unemployed.
The survey by Kyodo News agency also found roughly one in three Kobe
households said some family members were currently jobless or
experienced unemployment after the quake struck.
"On causes for unemployment, 63.5 percent blamed the quake, greatly
surpassing the 27 percent of respondents who blamed the economic
slump," Kyodo said.
Even so a majority of those surveyed -- 56 percent -- felt the affected
areas had nearly or fully recovered, while 37.5 percent said they the
areas had either not recovered much or at all, Kyodo said.
