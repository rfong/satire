The/DT bill/NN ,/, which/WDT goes/VBZ to/TO the/DT Senate/NNP ,/, would/MD cut/VB current/JJ aid/NN by/IN 11/CD percent/NN and/CC is/VBZ 20/CD percent/NN below/IN President/NNP Clinton/NNP 's/POS request/NN ./.

Aid/NNP to/TO Israel/NNP and/CC Egypt/NNP ,/, which/WDT receive/VBP more/JJR than/IN 40/CD percent/NN of/IN all/DT aid/NN under/IN the/DT bill/NN ,/, remains/VBZ intact/JJ ,/, making/VBG cuts/NNS to/TO other/JJ countries/NNS and/CC programs/NNS even/RB deeper/JJR ./.

The/DT House/NNP voted/VBD 333-89/CD to/TO approve/VB the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN covering/VBG foreign/JJ operations/NNS and/CC export/VB financing/NN ./.

Passage/NNP followed/VBD nearly/RB 30/CD hours/NNS of/IN sometimes/RB bitter/JJ debate/NN that/WDT included/VBD an/DT all-night/JJ session/NN last/JJ month/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, 133/CD Democrats/NNS joined/VBD 199/CD Republicans/NNS in/IN voting/NN for/IN the/DT bill/NN ./.

The/DT legislation/NN also/RB includes/VBZ a/DT prohibition/NN of/IN funds/NNS for/IN groups/NNS that/WDT support/VBP abortions/NNS even/RB where/WRB they/PRP are/VBP legal/JJ ,/, raising/VBG concerns/NNS among/IN family/NN planning/NN organizations/NNS that/IN it/PRP would/MD end/VB U.S./NNP support/NN for/IN their/PRP$ efforts/NNS ./.

On/IN the/DT final/JJ day/NN of/IN debate/NN ,/, the/DT House/NNP quickly/RB approved/VBD an/DT amendment/NN that/WDT would/MD withhold/VB any/DT lifting/NN of/IN the/DT embargo/NN against/IN Serbia/NNP and/CC Montenegro/NNP until/IN excessive/JJ Serbian/JJ control/NN over/IN the/DT province/NN of/IN Kosova/NNP is/VBZ ended/VBN ./.

Ironically/RB ,/, the/DT Republican/JJ manager/NN of/IN the/DT bill/NN ,/, Rep./NNP Sonny/NNP Callahan/NNP ,/, opposed/VBD the/DT bill/NN on/IN Serbia/NNP on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS that/IN it/PRP would/MD hinder/VB the/DT Clinton/NNP administration/NN in/IN the/DT conduct/NN of/IN its/PRP$ foreign/JJ policy/NN _/VBG a/DT complaint/NN Clinton/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN about/IN other/JJ Republican/JJ congressional/JJ action/NN on/IN foreign/JJ affairs/NNS ./.

``/`` We/PRP have/VBP 435/VBN little/JJ undersecretaries/NNS of/IN state/NN traveling/VBG all/DT over/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

Callahan/NNP said/VBD he/PRP ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, did/VBD not/RB know/VB where/WRB Kosova/NNP is/VBZ except/IN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ part/NN of/IN former/JJ Yugoslavia/NNP ./.

Callahan/NNP said/VBD he/PRP had/VBD received/VBN a/DT call/NN from/IN the/DT State/NNP Department/NNP opposing/VBG the/DT amendment/NN on/IN Serbia/NNP because/IN it/PRP would/MD interfere/VB with/IN the/DT conduct/NN of/IN U.S./NNP foreign/JJ policy/NN in/IN the/DT Yugoslav/NNP conflict/NN ./.

The/DT House/NNP also/RB considered/VBD an/DT amendment/NN to/TO restrict/VB aid/NN to/TO Kenya/NNP ,/, but/CC after/IN several/JJ members/NNS praised/VBD human/JJ rights/NNS progress/NN in/IN Kenya/NNP and/CC raised/VBD objections/NNS to/TO the/DT provision/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD withdrawn/VBN ./.

The/DT only/RB new/JJ provision/NN in/IN the/DT bill/NN is/VBZ a/DT $/$ 484/CD million/CD fund/NN it/PRP creates/VBZ for/IN child/NN survival/NN programs/NNS around/IN the/DT world/NN _/NN a/DT Republican/JJ plan/NN made/VBN in/IN response/NN to/TO Democratic/JJ criticism/NN that/IN children/NNS would/MD suffer/VB from/IN the/DT aid/NN cuts/NNS ,/, particularly/RB in/IN Africa/NNP ./.

Before/IN giving/VBG more/JJR than/IN the/DT required/JJ two-thirds/NNS approval/NN of/IN most-favored-nation/JJ trading/NN status/NN for/IN the/DT two/CD former/JJ communist/JJ nations/NNS ,/, the/DT House/NNP lapsed/VBN into/IN lengthy/JJ roll-call/JJ votes/NNS demanded/VBD by/IN Democrats/NNPS objecting/VBG to/TO Republican/JJ control/NN over/IN the/DT foreign/JJ aid/NN debate/NN ./.

Democrats/NNPS resumed/VBD tactics/NNS that/WDT led/VBD to/TO an/DT all-night/JJ session/NN on/IN the/DT Foreign/NNP Operations/NNPS bill/NN prior/RB to/TO last/JJ week/NN 's/POS Independence/NNP Day/NNP recess/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT Republican/JJ majority/NN prevailed/VBD ,/, and/CC debate/NN on/IN remaining/VBG amendments/NNS concluded/VBD under/IN new/JJ rules/NNS that/WDT limited/VBD the/DT time/NN for/IN consideration/NN ./.
