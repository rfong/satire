Former Golf Journalist Leads Tournament 
Former golf writer Robert Willis made himself the story Saturday when
he took the third-round lead of the dlrs 150,000 Victorian Open
tournament.
Willis, a Sydney pro, fired a two-under-par 70 at Victoria Golf Club
for an eight-under total of 208, one shot clear of South Australian
state amateur champion Gary Simpson, who also had a 70.
The 32-year-old Willis produced just two birdies -- at the par-4 second
and par-5 18th holes, but it was enough to take control as overnight
leader Stuart Appleby of Australia fell away dramatically with a 77.
Pre-tournament favorite Robert Allenby remained a threat, tied for
third and three shots out of the lead after a roller-coaster 71 which
included five birdies and four bogeys. Patrick Burke of the United
States is also at 211 after a 68, the best round of the day Saturday.
Canadians Jack Kay and Stuart Hendley was among a group of three at
212, four back of Willis. Kay had a 69 Saturday, Hendley a 70.
Willis, who formerly wrote for an Australian golf magazine and only won
a tour card on his third attempt, is seeking his first tour win.
``I thought someone would shoot a low round so I'm a little
surprised,'' Willis said. ``I looked up on the leaderboard to see who
was around and who was coming. I hit a lot of greens, but I didn't make
as many putts as I should have.''
Simpson, 22, has had a prolific amateur career, winning three of the
past four South Australian titles as well as the Canadian amateur
championship last year.
