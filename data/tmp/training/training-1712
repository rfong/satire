Alan/NNP Greenspan/NNP :/: Back/RB On/IN The/DT Tightrope/NNP On/IN the/DT night/NN when/WRB everyone/NN who/WP 's/VBZ anyone/NN crowded/VBN into/IN the/DT chamber/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Representatives/NNPS for/IN Bill/NNP Clinton/NNP 's/POS State/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP address/VBP ,/, where/WRB was/VBD the/DT second/JJ most/RBS important/JJ man/NN in/IN America/NNP ?/.

Not/RB behind/IN him/PRP on/IN the/DT podium/NN ./.

Not/RB among/IN the/DT Senate/NNP grandees/NNS ,/, scowling/VBG an/DT ever-doleful/NN scowl/VBP ./.

And/CC not/RB in/IN the/DT balcony/NN above/IN ,/, squeezed/VBD uncomfortably/NN -LRB-/-LRB- in/IN every/DT sense/NN -RRB-/-RRB- between/IN the/DT first/JJ and/CC the/DT second/JJ ladies/NNS ,/, as/IN he/PRP was/VBD two/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./.

No/UH ,/, Alan/NNP Greenspan/NNP was/VBD at/IN home/NN ,/, nursing/VBG a/DT cup/NN of/IN yogurt/NN and/CC watching/VBG the/DT whole/JJ affair/NN on/IN TV/NN ./.

Normally/RB ,/, Greenspan/NNP 's/POS avoidance/NN of/IN the/DT spotlight/NN would/MD seem/VB in/IN character/NN ./.

The/DT chairman/NN of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP is/VBZ ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, a/DT man/NN who/WP has/VBZ always/RB seemed/VBN happiest/JJ when/WRB hidden/VBN in/IN his/PRP$ marble/NN sanctum/NN ./.

Yet/CC in/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ weeks/NNS ,/, Greenspan/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN playing/VBG an/DT uncharacteristically/RB public/JJ role/NN :/: volunteering/VBG a/DT plan/NN to/TO slice/VB the/DT federal/JJ deficit/NN by/IN cutting/VBG the/DT yearly/JJ inflation-adjustments/NNS paid/VBN to/TO pensioners/NNS ;/: lobbying/VBG Congress/NNP on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT administration/NN for/IN its/PRP$ Mexican/JJ bailout/NN ;/: and/CC warning/VBG the/DT new/JJ boys/NNS on/IN Capitol/NNP Hill/NNP not/RB to/TO fiddle/VB the/DT books/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ crazed/VBN quest/NN to/TO cut/VB taxes/NNS ./.

The/DT new/JJ visibility/NN is/VBZ not/RB so/RB surprising/JJ ./.

Greenspan/NNP is/VBZ a/DT Republican/NNP of/IN impeccable/JJ credentials/NNS :/: appointed/VBN by/IN Ronald/NNP Reagan/NNP ;/: a/DT former/JJ employee/NN of/IN Richard/NNP Nixon/NNP and/CC Gerald/NNP Ford/NNP ;/: and/CC ,/, as/IN one/CD Reagan/NNP aide/NN puts/VBZ it/PRP ,/, ``/`` a/DT key/JJ player/NN in/IN more/RBR Republican/JJ presidential/JJ campaigns/NNS ,/, platforms/NNS and/CC administrations/NNS than/IN any/DT other/JJ economist/NN in/IN the/DT country/NN ./. ''/''

With/IN his/PRP$ party/NN in/IN complete/JJ control/NN of/IN Congress/NNP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN in/IN 40/CD years/NNS ,/, Greenspan/NNP 's/POS influence/NN is/VBZ perhaps/RB greater/JJR now/RB than/IN it/PRP ever/RB has/VBZ been/VBN ./.

And/CC yet/RB ,/, by/IN an/DT irony/NN ,/, the/DT very/JJ realignment/NN that/WDT has/VBZ enhanced/VBN his/PRP$ power/NN may/MD also/RB turn/VB out/RP to/TO make/VB harder/RBR his/PRP$ main/JJ task/NN :/: guiding/VBG a/DT slowing/VBG economy/NN to/TO a/DT ``/`` soft/JJ landing/NN ''/'' rather/RB than/IN a/DT hard/JJ recession/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT economy/NN is/VBZ doing/VBG anything/NN but/CC slowing/VBG ./.

Last/JJ year/NN output/NN grew/VBD by/IN 4/CD percent/NN and/CC is/VBZ still/RB surging/VBG ahead/RB ./.

The/DT unemployment/NN rate/NN fell/VBD by/IN more/JJR than/IN a/DT full/JJ percentage/NN point/NN ,/, to/TO 5.5/CD percent/NN -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC to/TO nearly/RB 5/CD percent/NN outside/IN California/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Labor/NNP shortages/NNS are/VBP starting/VBG to/TO crop/VB up/RP ./.

So/RB ,/, too/RB ,/, are/VBP the/DT faint/JJ signs/NNS of/IN incipient/JJ inflation/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN rising/VBG commodity/NN prices/NNS ./.

And/CC so/RB when/WRB Greenspan/NNP convenes/VBZ the/DT meeting/NN of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Open-Market/NNP Committee/NNP on/IN Jan./NNP 31/CD ,/, the/DT chances/NNS are/VBP high/JJ that/IN it/PRP will/MD vote/VB to/TO put/VB up/RP short-term/JJ rates/NNS ./.

If/IN that/DT happens/VBZ ,/, as/IN looks/VBZ likely/JJ ,/, it/PRP will/MD be/VB the/DT seventh/JJ such/JJ rate/NN increase/NN in/IN less/JJR than/IN a/DT year/NN ./.

So/IN far/RB the/DT Clinton/NNP administration/NN has/VBZ greeted/VBN the/DT escalation/NN with/IN considerable/JJ stoicism/NN :/: a/DT sensible/JJ stance/NN ./.

Before/IN Greenspan/NNP began/VBD raising/VBG rates/NNS last/JJ February/NNP ,/, he/PRP had/VBD not/RB done/VBN so/RB for/IN five/CD years/NNS ./.

Had/VBD the/DT booming/JJ economy/NN remained/VBN unrestrained/JJ through/IN 1994/CD ,/, inflation/NN would/MD almost/RB certainly/RB have/VB arrived/VBN already/RB ./.

But/CC now/RB Greenspan/NNP faces/VBZ a/DT trickier/JJ task/NN ,/, both/DT economically/NN and/CC politically/RB ./.

Everyone/NN knows/VBZ last/JJ year/NN 's/POS rate/NN increases/NNS will/MD slow/VB the/DT economy/NN ./.

The/DT question/NN is/VBZ when/WRB ,/, and/CC by/IN how/WRB much/JJ ./.

Greenspan/NNP 's/POS own/JJ suspicions/NNS are/VBP not/RB much/RB more/RBR reliable/JJ than/IN anyone/NN else/RB 's/VBZ ./.

But/CC in/IN pursuit/NN of/IN a/DT soft/JJ landing/NN ,/, the/DT chairman/NN may/MD well/RB decide/VB that/IN rates/NNS need/VBP to/TO be/VB hiked/VBN several/JJ times/NNS over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ months/NNS ./.

David/NNP Hale/NNP of/IN Kemper/NNP Financial/NNP Services/NNPS is/VBZ not/RB alone/RB in/IN thinking/VBG that/IN ,/, to/TO slow/VB growth/NN to/TO around/RB 2.5/CD percent/NN ,/, the/DT Fed/NNP could/MD be/VB forced/VBN to/TO raise/VB short-term/JJ rates/NNS from/IN 5.5/CD percent/NN today/NN to/TO 8/CD percent/NN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN ./.

With/IN the/DT prospect/NN of/IN the/DT Fed/NNP 's/POS actions/NNS hitting/VBG home/RB as/IN the/DT 1996/CD primary/JJ season/NN gets/VBZ under/IN way/NN ,/, both/DT Democrats/NNPS and/CC Republicans/NNPS are/VBP getting/VBG ready/JJ for/IN a/DT downturn/NN ./.

Naturally/RB ,/, each/DT side/NN will/MD blame/VB the/DT other/JJ ./.

But/CC both/DT may/MD attack/VB the/DT Fed/NNP just/RB as/RB sharply/RB ./.

In/IN the/DT White/NNP House/NNP ,/, Clinton/NNP 's/POS tongue/NN was/VBD long/RB held/VBN by/IN Lloyd/NNP Bentsen/NNP ;/: now/RB the/DT new/JJ treasury/NN secretary/NN ,/, Robert/NNP Rubin/NNP ,/, has/VBZ that/DT slippery/JJ job/NN ./.

But/CC other/JJ members/NNS of/IN Clinton/NNP 's/POS economic/JJ team/NN ,/, and/CC several/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ political/JJ advisers/NNS ,/, are/VBP urging/VBG him/PRP to/TO squeal/VB if/IN the/DT Fed/NNP raises/VBZ rates/NNS again/RB ./.

Republicans/NNPS ,/, too/RB ,/, are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO attack/VB Greenspan/NNP ./.

Late/RB last/JJ year/NN Newt/NNP Gingrich/NNP said/VBD he/PRP thought/VBD rising/VBG interest/NN rates/NNS were/VBD ``/`` a/DT real/JJ problem/NN ''/'' and/CC then/RB backpedaled/VBD furiously/RB ./.

But/CC he/PRP also/RB suggested/VBD that/IN the/DT economy/NN could/MD grow/VB by/IN as/RB much/JJ as/IN 5/CD percent/NN without/IN sparking/VBG inflation/NN ./.

And/CC James/NNP Saxton/NNP ,/, a/DT House/NNP Republican/NNP who/WP is/VBZ the/DT new/JJ vice-chairman/NN of/IN the/DT joint/JJ economic/JJ committee/NN ,/, has/VBZ already/RB blamed/VBN the/DT Fed/NNP in/IN advance/NN for/IN the/DT recession/NN he/PRP sees/VBZ ahead/RB ./.

Greenspan/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN here/RB before/RB ,/, standing/VBG up/RP simultaneously/RB to/TO bullying/VB from/IN both/CC the/DT White/NNP House/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ fellow/JJ Republicans/NNS during/IN George/NNP Bush/NNP 's/POS tenure/NN ./.

But/CC this/DT time/NN something/NN is/VBZ different/JJ :/: both/DT parties/NNS are/VBP pursuing/VBG tax-cutting/JJ policies/NNS which/WDT are/VBP bound/VBN to/TO make/VB his/PRP$ job/NN more/RBR difficult/JJ ./.

For/IN whether/IN or/CC not/RB Republicans/NNS come/VBN up/RP on/IN paper/NN with/IN the/DT spending/NN cuts/VBZ to/TO offset/VB their/PRP$ tax-chopping/NN ,/, investors/NNS will/MD be/VB suspicious/JJ that/IN the/DT cuts/NNS are/VBP phony/JJ or/CC temporary/JJ ;/: that/IN the/DT tax/NN reductions/NNS will/MD prove/VB more/RBR costly/JJ than/IN expected/VBN ;/: and/CC that/IN the/DT deficit/NN will/MD therefore/RB balloon/VB ./.

Such/JJ is/VBZ the/DT stuff/NN that/WDT fuels/VBZ inflationary/JJ expectations/NNS --/: which/WDT Greenspan/NNP would/MD surely/RB feel/VB compelled/VBN to/TO stamp/VB down/RP ./.

The/DT chairman/NN will/MD no/DT doubt/NN be/VB hoping/VBG that/IN cooler/NN heads/VBZ prevail/VB --/: and/CC not/RB just/RB for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN ./.

With/IN his/PRP$ term/NN due/JJ to/TO run/VB out/RP in/IN early/JJ 1996/CD ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN angling/VBG for/IN reappointment/NN since/IN Clinton/NNP arrived/VBD ;/: cabinet/NN officials/NNS report/VBP being/VBG called/VBN repeatedly/RB for/IN breakfast/NN and/CC flattery/NN from/IN Greenspan/NNP ./.

The/DT Republican/JJ takeover/NN on/IN Capitol/NNP Hill/NNP seemed/VBD to/TO many/JJ within/IN the/DT administration/NN to/TO seal/VB the/DT deal/NN ./.

Who/WP else/RB would/MD so/RB easily/RB fly/VB through/IN confirmation/NN in/IN the/DT Senate/NNP ?/.

If/IN the/DT economy/NN crash-lands/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, so/RB too/RB may/MD Greenspan/NNP 's/POS hopes/NNS of/IN another/DT series/NN of/IN state/NN of/IN the/DT unions/NNS spent/VBN at/IN home/NN by/IN choice/NN ./.
