China/NNP Moves/NNP to/TO Tackle/NNP Ceramics/NNPS Oversupply/NNP China/NNP 's/POS sanitary/JJ ceramic/JJ ware/NN industry/NN is/VBZ facing/VBG structural/JJ supply/NN difficulties/NNS ./.

The/DT main/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN production/NN of/IN low-class/JJ sanitary/JJ ceramics/NNS exceeds/VBZ demand/NN while/IN the/DT industry/NN 's/POS enterprises/NNS are/VBP unable/JJ to/TO meet/VB demand/NN for/IN high-grade/JJ products/NNS ,/, said/VBD a/DT China/NNP Daily/NNP report/NN today/NN ./.

Industry/NN experts/NNS told/VBD the/DT newspaper/NN that/IN output/NN of/IN high-grade/JJ sanitary/JJ ceramics/NNS only/RB accounted/VBD for/IN between/IN ten/CD and/CC 15/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT total/NN ./.

Output/NN of/IN sanitary/JJ ceramics/NNS totaled/VBD 54/CD to/TO 55/CD million/CD items/NNS in/IN 1997/CD ,/, and/CC output/NN this/DT year/NN is/VBZ not/RB expected/VBN to/TO increase/VB much/RB ./.

Experts/NNS predict/VBP that/IN demand/NN for/IN sanitary/JJ ceramics/NNS will/MD rise/VB in/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ years/NNS as/IN the/DT Chinese/JJ Government/NN takes/VBZ measures/NNS to/TO stimulate/VB the/DT real/JJ estate/NN market/NN ./.

But/CC demand/NN this/DT year/NN will/MD not/RB grow/VB much/RB since/IN it/PRP will/MD take/VB some/DT time/NN for/IN the/DT economy/NN to/TO see/VB the/DT effects/NNS of/IN the/DT government/NN 's/POS action/NN ,/, especially/RB in/IN sectors/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT building/NN materials/NNS sector/NN ./.

The/DT oversupply/NN in/IN the/DT medium/NN -/: and/CC low-grade/JJ sanitary/JJ ceramics/NNS sector/NN has/VBZ contributed/VBN to/TO a/DT price/NN war/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ slashed/VBN profit/NN margins/NNS ./.

Some/DT sanitary/JJ ceramic/JJ manufacturers/NNS make/VBP inferior/JJ products/NNS to/TO try/VB to/TO balance/VB income/NN and/CC expenditure/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ hampered/VBN the/DT healthy/JJ progress/NN of/IN the/DT industry/NN ./.
