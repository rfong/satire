Candidate shuns hardliners' boycott call 
A candidate running in Palestinian elections despite a boycott call
from his hardline faction said Monday he wanted to join in building a
Palestinian state if elected.
Fawz Khalifa, a supporter of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, told an audience he is running in next Saturday's poll "out
of the belief that the opposition must participate in the building
effort."
The PFLP has called for a boycott of the Saturday election, saying they
are the result of self-rule agreements with Israel that fell short of
Palestinian demands for statehood.
"I personally disagreed with the position of the leadership of the PFLP
on the elections," Khalifa said. "I believe participating in the
elections is the right thing to do."
"We have one goal: building the independent state," he added.
Appearing with six other candidates, Khalifa faced persistent questions
about why he is not only running, but has also joined a list with
supporters of Yasser Arafat and the autonomy agreements with Israel.
Khalifa countered that coming together with Arafat supporters now did
not mean they would take the same positions in the future. As an
example, he said he opposes changing the PLO's Palestinian National
Charter calling for Israel's destruction.
"We cannot amend this until we achieve the right of (refugee) return
and self-determination," he said.
Khalifa said he had not received any criticism from PFLP headquarters
in Damascus about his campaign.
