Cheney Gets Seasick While Warning Iran from Aircraft Carrier
ON THE USS JOHN C. STENNIS (UPI) -- From an aircraft carrier in the
Persian Gulf, US Vice President Dick Cheney warned Iran on Friday that
the USA will "do anything" to ensure that Iran stops selling its oil in
Euros and thereby sending the US dollar down the toilet.
Cheney had fled Washington, DC since his name had appeared as one of
the top clients in the address book of an infamous prostitution agency
and needed something to divert the media.
"We'll keep the sea lanes open," the seasick Cheney said from the
hangar deck of the USS John C. Stennis as it floated within range of
Iranian supersonic cruise missiles which could sink the vessel.
"I am following the orders of my Zionist masters by threatening Iran
also," he said, then violently vomited on the deck. "Israel wants to
continue stealing Palestinian land in peace, and wants to keep its boot
on the neck of all Arab and Islamic countries. Israel also wants to
have the only nuclear bombs in the area. Not that Iran is enriching
uranium for that of course - Iran wants to use nuclear energy to
replace its dwindling oil supplies."
Standing in front of a dozen F-18 Super Hornet fighters and a huge
American flag on the humongous hangar deck, Cheney continued to throw
up.
"We want to complete the mission of grabbing Iraq's oil for US Big Oil
under long-term contracts, you know, really get it done right, and
return like dishonorable scumbags," he told the Stennis crew and
assorted butterball reporters.
"And you also know how I've enriched the coffers of sleazebag
Republican companies like Halliburton with giant multibillion dollar
contracts in the illegal, murderous and immoral Iraq war."
Some 4,000 of the carrier's 5,000 sailors and Marines stood in
sweltering heat of over 100 degrees to hear Cheney speak and watch him
finally faint.
"We'll go to any lengths to grab foreign oil for American SUVs and
monster homes with our extremism and strategic threats. We'll continue
to subjugate the poor and dispossessed throughout the planet," he
finally gasped upon regaining consciousness.
After returning from the carrier in an ambulance helicopter, Cheney had
dinner with United Arab Emirates Crown Prince Sheik Mohammed bin
Zayeddyzapperrapper Al Nahyanyanyannimanman, who asked for and received
further bribes to support further US warfare against Iraq and Iran.
On Saturday, Cheney made a fence-mending visit to the feudal, sleazy
kingdom of Saudi Arabia which has lately been giving Iraq and the USA
the cold shoulder. Cheney enjoyed a relaxing stay at several Saudi
harems run by the hundreds of super-rich Saudi princes.
Cheney then met with Saudi King Abdullah who has increasingly sent
signals that he thinks the US troop buildup in Baghdad "is a crazy
fucking idea, just like the idea of war against Iran."
Abdullah's recent snub of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, the
American puppet, was aimed at showing Saudi Arabia's concern that the
Iraqi government is a boot-licking bunch of monkeys toadying to US oil
imperialism, just like the governments of Aghanistan, Egypt, Israel,
Saudi Arabia itself, Jordan, Germany, Kuwait, France, Canada,
Australia, Poland and Britain.
Iraq, like Iran, is heavily Shiite, while Saudi Arabia has a mainly
impoverished Sunni Muslim population.
