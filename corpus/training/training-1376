New state "Serbia and Montenegro" to last at least three years 
Belgrade and Podgorica leaders have agreed to form the new union of
"Serbia and Montenegro" for three years, after which either could seek
independence, according to an EU-brokered accord they signed Thursday.
"Upon the expiration of a three-year period, the member states shall be
entitled to institute proceedings to change the status of the state,
that is, withdrawal from the state union," said the accord, signed in
Belgrade.
Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, Montenegrin President Milo
Djukanovic, Serbian and Montenegrin Prime Ministers Zoran Djindjic and
Filip Vujanovic and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana signed the
landmark accord.
