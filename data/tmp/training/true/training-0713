The/DT meeting/NN comes/VBZ as/IN a/DT UN-brokered/JJ cessation/NN of/IN hostilies/JJ accord/NN is/VBZ under/IN severe/JJ strain/NN ,/, with/IN both/DT warring/VBG armies/NNS having/VBG recently/RB advanced/VBD their/PRP$ frontlines/NNS in/IN two/CD different/JJ sectors/NNS of/IN the/DT war/NN ./.

Retaliatory/NNP Serb/NNP shelling/VBG into/IN Bihac/JJ town/NN last/JJ weekend/NN killed/VBD seven/CD people/NNS while/IN here/RB in/IN Sarajevo/NNP a/DT youth/NN was/VBD shot/VBN and/CC wounded/VBN Tuesday/NNP by/IN sniper/NN fire/NN ,/, which/WDT according/VBG to/TO the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS appeared/VBD to/TO come/VB from/IN Serb/NNP lines/NNS ./.

The/DT latter/JJ two/CD parties/NNS are/VBP not/RB signatories/JJ to/TO the/DT four-month/JJ truce/NN and/CC UN/NNP negotiators/NNS have/VBP made/VBN little/JJ headway/NN persuading/VBG them/PRP to/TO at/IN least/JJS respect/VB the/DT spirit/NN of/IN the/DT accord/NN ./.

Of/IN more/JJR immediate/JJ concern/NN to/TO the/DT people/NNS of/IN Sarajevo/NNP is/VBZ the/DT lingering/VBG conflict/NN over/IN the/DT type/NN of/IN humanitarian/JJ traffic/NN to/TO be/VB allowed/VBN on/IN roads/NNS running/VBG south/NN of/IN here/RB that/WDT link/VBP the/DT capital/NN to/TO the/DT outside/JJ world/NN ./.
