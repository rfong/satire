Worldwide PC Shipments Down in April-June Quarter 
Worldwide shipments of personal computers (PCs) stood at 30.43 million
units in the April-June quarter, down 1.9 percent from a year earlier,
the research firm Gartner Japan Ltd. said in a preliminary report on
Monday.
It is the first time since 1986 that the world PC market has had a
negative growth rate, a sign that a slowing U.S. economy is affecting
other countries and dealing a blow to the global PC market, the report
said.
The PC market is unlikely to achieve sustained high growth unless there
is a change in the industrial structure, the report noted, adding that
there is need for PC makers to devise value- added products.
By makers, shipments of Dell Computer Corp. of the United States came
to four million units in April-June, up 20.2 percent from a year
earlier, according to the report. Dell is the only major PC maker that
enjoyed a year-on-year increase in shipments.
Dell was followed by Compaq Computer Corp. with shipments of 3. 40
million units, down 14.4 percent, International Business Machines Corp.
with 2.13 million, down 6.9 percent, Hewlett- Packard Co. with 2.07
million, down 8.5 percent, and NEC Corp. with shipments of 1.26 million
units, down 8.5 percent.
