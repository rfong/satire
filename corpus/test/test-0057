Over 100 nominations submitted for 1996 Nobel Peace Prize by Pia Ohlin 
A total of 106 nominations have been submitted for the 1996 Nobel Peace
Prize, which will be announced in October, Nobel Institute director
Geir Lundestad said Monday.
Of these, he said 82 were individuals and 24 were organisations.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee never announces the names of the
candidates.
But press reports said the list includes imprisoned dissidents Wei
Jingsheng of China and Kurdish deputy Leyla Zana of Turkey, Israeli
scientist Mordechai Vanunu, as well as several people or groups often
mentioned as contenders for the prize such as former US president Jimmy
Carter and the Salvation Army.
The annual deadline for submitting nominations is February 1 although
nominations postmarked by that date will also be considered.
"There will probably be a few more, as we have received quite a few
letters in recent days," Lundestad told AFP.
"We expect the final number to be in the same range as in recent years,
that is, between 120 and 130 nominations," he said.
Nominations can be made -- and announced -- by government or national
assembly members around the world, as well as other groups or
individuals such as universities, former peace prize laureates, the
five-member Norwegian Nobel committee, and members of the World Court
in The Hague.
US diplomat Richard Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton peace accord
signed in Paris in December, was seen as a possible winner of the 1996
peace prize, along with East Timorese Catholic Bishop Carlos Felipe
Ximenes Belo of Dili, who was a candidate last year.
Others include a Cambodian monk who has led two walks for peace, Maha
Ghosananda, and Ibrahim Rugova, the president of Kosovo, an
Albanian-majority region of Serbia .
Among the organisations nominated are the Committee of Mothers of
Russian Soldiers, nominated for the first time, the aid group Medecins
sans frontieres (Doctors without Borders) and the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Last year, the prize was won by Britain's Joseph Rotblat and his
Pugwash movement for nuclear disarmament.
The Nobel peace prize is awarded in Oslo, in contrast to the other
Nobel prizes which are awarded in Stockholm.
The award's creator, Swedish scientist and discoverer Alfred Nobel,
wrote in his will in 1895 that Norway was to be included in his
initiative, as Norway was joined with Sweden in a union until 1905.
This year's peace prize laureate will receive the record sum of 7.4
million Swedish kronor (1.05 million dollars), up from last year's 7.2
million kronor (1.02 million dollars).
The winner will receive the prize in Oslo, as tradition dictates, on
December 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel in San Remo,
Italy, one hundred years ago in 1896.
