Raducan threatens to retire 
Romanian gymnast Andreea Raducan, who was stripped of an Olympic gold
medal in Sydney after taking medicine for a cold which contained a
banned substance, said Thursday she was considering retiring.
The 18-year-old said she was increasingly afraid she would be unable to
reproduce the form which has already brought her a host of medals.
"I want to retire, but I haven't made my final decision yet," she told
the Mediafax agency.
"If I fail at the European championships, everyone will get on my
back," she added.
Raducan is also suffering from pain in her back and knees and has been
unable to train since Tuesday, she said from the Olympic training
centre in Deva.
"The coach Octavian Belu has proposed a special programme with a single
training session a day, but I don't think that will resolve the
problem," she said.
"If I decide to stay, I'll only do so for my team-mates. But I think
I've already made enough compromises," she added.
Raducan, compared with the legendary Romanian Nadia Comaneci following
her brilliant all-round winning performance in Sydney, had her overall
gold revoked after testing positive for pseudoephedrine.
The drug was contained in a cold tablet given to her by Romania's team
physician Ioachin Oana, who was banned for four years by the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) who agreed Raducan had
unknowingly taken the drug.
The IOC allowed Raducan to keep her gold medal from the team combined
event and the silver she won in the vault.
Raducan won three golds at last year's world championships in Ghent.
