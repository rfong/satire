Born in an upper-crust family in the small town of Thamesville in
southwestern Ontario, Davies began writing at the age of 11. He also took
up theater and taught English at the University of Toronto's Massey College
up until 1982.
Davies studied at Oxford University where he developed an interest in
theater and starred in several performances at London's Old Vic
theater.
He returned to Canada during World War II and became a journalist,
following in his father's footsteps. He wrote several plays and
comedies that drew mixed reviews.
His first novel "Tempest Tost" was published in 1951.
