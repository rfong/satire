Italian boxer loses fight for life 
Italian boxer Fabrizio De Chiara was pronounced dead here early Monday,
after being in a coma since collapsing in the ring during a bout
Saturday night.
The 25-year-old was brain dead Sunday night, but under Italian law was
kept alive artificially until being pronounced dead at 1.30 am Monday.
De Chiara, the challenger in a national middleweight title bout, was
floored by a welter of blows to the face and body in the 12th and final
round from Vincenzo Imparato on Saturday night.
The referee declared Imparato the winner by a technical knockout, but
De Chiara collapsed as he made his way back to his corner.
Taken first to a local hospital at Carrara, the fighter was soon moved
to a neurological unit at Pisa and underwent a four-hour operation
overnight, but his condition continued to deteriorate throughout
Sunday.
