Just two months ago, the mountain villages were overflowing with
refugees fleeing the Russian bombing in the plains.
Now that the plains have been captured by the Russians and the bombing
has switched to the hills, the same villages are like ghost towns.
But there are still thousands of people left in rebel-held Chechnya,
living without electricity, running water, television, radios, or even
basic supplies such as cigarettes and clothing.
Those who have decided to stay, or have nowhere else to run, are
defiant and vow to fight a bitter rearguard action if the Russians push
up into the hills, where legendary Chechen leader Shamil fought the
Tsarist armies a century and a half ago.
"They know what's going to happpen to them if they come up here: It
will be the bloodiest fighting of the war," said Islam Gunayev, in the
tiny village of Khadzhi Yurt, named after a Chechen Moslem prophet.
"They will only take these hills over my dead body," said another
resident, who would not give his name, as he fingered his foot-long
Kinzhal, the traditional Chechen dagger.
During an air raid on Vedeno, a boy bleeding from light wounds to his
head, was brought into the bomb shelter. "Look at who these people are.
They're defending their homes, their free republic. Better to die here
than to surrender," said Nasir Asalayev, deputy commander of the Vedeno
district.
Given their all-out assault so far in the almost six-month war to
restore Moscow's rule over Chechnya, the Russians seem unlikely not to
try and take the mountains.
But the narrow, winding roads will be difficult territory for Russia's
tanks and infantry carriers, while the steep hills and thick woods give
the Chechens vital cover.
The Chechen guerrillas know their hills backwards and forwards. Jeeps
full of fighters armed with machine guns, rifles and rocket-propelled
grenades constantly race around the roads during breaks between air
raids.
In many villages, barely clothed children with shaved heads ran out
into the road to greet the guerrillas with clenched fists and the
Moslem cry of "Allakhu Akhbar," or "God is great."
Standing outside the ruins of a 19th Century Russian fort in Vedeno,
22-year-old fighter Aslambyek said he was ready to die defending the
last chunk of rebel-controlled Chechnya.
"Yes, the Russians had a fort up here then, but they had to pull out,"
he said. "Now we're going to stand to the end. For us, it's freedom or
death."
