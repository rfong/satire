Algeria conference seeks "framework" for political future 
The military-backed regime of President Liamine Zeroual and opposition
parties, including Islamic moderates, will meet here Saturday and
Sunday to try to agree on guiding principles to end violence and
restore democratic government
About 1,000 delegates, including personalities and non-political
professionals, are due to attend the conference which is billed as a
"platform for national entente" after four years of bloodshed.
However several opposition parties on the left have decided to boycott
the conference and the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) will not be
represented either.
The purpose of the conference is to come up with a text "ruling out
violence as a means of political action" and insisting on the need for
"respect for the constitution and the rule of law".
The regime contends that the violence plaguing the country has its
roots in the failure of both the FIS and the former regime of president
Chadli Bendjadid to respect these principles.
The FIS has rejected the Algiers conference, and its exiled leadership
in Bonn, called Wednesday for a boycott. It urged the government to
open "genuine negotiations" with the founding fathers of the FIS,
Abassi Madani, Ali Belhadj and Abdelkader Hachani, all of whom are
still in jail.
The parties which have agreed to take part are the formerly ruling
National Liberation Front, the Islamic Revival Movement (MRI-Ennahda -
a onetime FIS ally - and the Islamic Society Movement (MSI-Hamas). The
latter's participation was in doubt up to the last minute but it
finally announced Wednesday night that it would join in.
MSI-Hamas which holds two portfolios in the present government, wanted
FIS "elders" to be allowed to take part in the conference. The daily
newspaper Liberte said that in exchange for joining the conference, the
MSI-Hamas had won an assurance that Islamic parties would not be banned
when the constitution is revised.
The government has described the conference as "decisive for the future
of democracy" It is the crowning point of the policy of dialogue
launched by Zeroual after his triumph in the November 1995 presidential
election when he won 60.1 percent
It was not yet clear Thursday whether the conference would confine
itself to adopting the draft declaration or if it would set a date for
legislative elections due in the first half of next year following a
constitutional referendum expected before the end of this year.
Four parties are boycotting the parley, not all for the same reasons
The Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) of Said Sadi which defends
the rights of ethnic Berbers and the communist Ettahadi (challenge)
party, both fiercely oppose mixing religion with politics. They want a
secular society and a ban on Islamic parties which they say are a
"permanent threat" to democracy and the republic.
The Front of Socialist Forces (FFS) of Hocine Ait-Ahmed and the
Movement for Democracy in Algeria (MDA) for the country's first
post-independence leader Ahmed Ben Bella, believe the Islamic militants
must be part of any lasting settlement.
The FFS has accused Zeroual of using the conference as an "alibi" to
set up "a constitutional dictatorship".
The government claimed last month week to have virtually crushed the
Islamic insurgency launched after the FIS was cheated of victory in
legislative polls which were called off by the army at the beginning of
1992 before voting was complete.
