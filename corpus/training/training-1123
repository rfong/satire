"We have a different dialogue with the Tamil people and we have offered a
political package and extended a hand of friendship," said Kumaratunga, a
member of the majority Sinhalese community.
Shortly after coming to power last year on a pledge to restore peace,
Kumaratunga opened talks with the LTTE. In April this year the rebels
abruptly pulled out to resume their protracted campaign for an
independent homeland in the island's northeast.
Military officials said soldiers were still 2.5 kilometres (1.5 miles)
away from the Jaffna town centre after entering the municipal limits on
Monday.
The blockade of Jaffna came despite the LTTE's downing Wednesday of an
air force transport plane which was taking 60 security personnel to the
battle front. Three crew members also perished.
It was not immediately clear if the army would be able to sustain its
35,000 soldiers in the Jaffna peninsula without the vital air-bridge.
Monsoon rains have also prevented the navy from operating boats in
rough weather.
The only land route to the Jaffna peninsula is under rebel control.
