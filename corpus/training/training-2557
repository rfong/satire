Netanyahu Defends Shoot-out at Israeli Consulate 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday defended the
shoot-out at the Israeli consulate in Berlin, in which three Kurdish
protesters were shot dead by Israeli security guards.
Speaking to a news conference in Tel-Aviv, Netanyahu said that the
security guards had shot in self-defense.
He added that the guards were entitled to use necessary forces,
including opening fire, against any attempt to take consulate members
as hostages.
Over a dozen other protesters were also wounded during the clashes when
they tried to break into the consulate.
No Israelis were injured in the violence, the Israeli Foreign Ministry
said.
The Kurdish protesters stormed the consulate after a news report
claimed that Israel's spy agency Mossad had helped Turkey track and
capture the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
The arrest of Ocalan by Turkish agents on Tuesday has sparked Kurdish
riots and demonstrations throughout Europe.
At the news conference, Netanyahu denied again that Israel was involved
in Ocalan's capture at the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.
Meanwhile, Israel closed all its political missions in Europe on
Wednesday after the violence in Berlin.
Israel Radio also quoted Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who is
currently visiting the United States, as saying that the clashes in the
Berlin consulate were a serious matter.
Sharon stressed again the need to fight terrorism locally, regionally
and internationally. He said that there is no room for compromise with
terror.
