Priceless artifacts found in Egyptian prison 
A trove of priceless ancient artifacts was discovered in a cell block
housing hardcore murderers and thieves at one of Egypt's highest
security prisons, the daily Al-Ahram said.
The pieces from Egypt's pharaonic, Greco-Roman and Islamic eras had sat
for years at the entrance of cell block two in Liman al-Turah prison
until they were noticed by a prison inspector, the daily said.
Prisoners digging the foundations for a reception for the prison, south
of Cairo, unearthed them and, not realizing their value, set them aside
prison officials said, the paper reported in its early edition for
Tuesday.
Cell block two houses prisoners serving long terms for murder or theft,
the paper added.
The pieces included a trio of stone statues dating back to the
pharaonic Ancient Empire, the top of a Greek column, two Greek vases
carved with depictions of Greek myths and an undated statuette of a
nude woman.
Also among them was a stone bust of a Mamluk noble, most probably Ali
Bek al-Kabir, and a prayer podium, most probably from the Ibn Tulun
mosque, one of Cairo oldest mosques dating back to 879 AD.
The inspector, Sayed Abdel Halim, told the paper he recognized the
pieces might be valuable because he had once worked as in the
antiquities police.
The artifacts were handed over to the Supreme Antiquities Council for
examination, the paper said.
Liman al-Turah, which also holds prisoners involved in Moslem militant
violence, is built near Misr al-Qadima, the original site where Cairo
was built over a millenium ago.
