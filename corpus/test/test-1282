European observers declare Pakistan polls transparent 
A team of observers from the European Union said Tuesday the voting
process in Pakistan's elections was transparent and they found no
evidence of widespread electoral fraud.
"In general the results of the election expressed the wishes of the
Pakistani electorate and the process of voting was transparent in spite
of some shortcomings," the observers said in a statement here.
The observers group had deployed 41 teams throughout the four provinces
and in the northwestern tribal areas where people have been given the
right to vote for the first time in 50 years.
It said the shortcomings for the most part concernd the compilation of
electoral registers, the identification of voters and voting by women
and minorities.
But overall the election authorities did everything possible within
their powers to create the conditions for free and fair voting, the
statement said.
Although procedural and technical arrangement left room for
improvement, the observers found no evidence of widespread electoral
fraud.
