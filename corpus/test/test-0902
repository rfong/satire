OECD inflation slowed in November
Consumer prices in industrial countries grouped in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rose by 0.1 percent on average
last November for an increase of 2.4 percent over 12 months, the OECD said
Thursday.
This compared with month-to-month increases of 0.2 percent in October
and 0.3 percent in September, excluding high-inflation Turkey, the
organization said in its monthly survey of consumer price inflation.
It said underlying inflation -- as measured by the consumer price index
with the exception of food and energy prices -- fell to 2.4 percent,
0.5 percentage point down on the level recorded in November 1993.
Inflation remained steady in the United States and Britain, where
prices were up by 0.1 percent in November, and in Italy, which recorded
a monthly increase of 0.5 percent.
In Japan prices actually fell by 0.3 percent, against a 0.5 percent
rise in October, while France reported unchanged prices after a 0.3
ppercent October rise.
In Germany, prices increased by 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent rise in
October, while in Canada, they were up by 0.5 percent after a 0.2
percent fall in October.
