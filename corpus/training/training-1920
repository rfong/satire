More Fighting Casualties In Somalia And New Elder Mediation 
The Somali Abgal and Murusade sub-clans clashed again in Bermuda
District of South Mogadishu on Monday, leaving 6 dead and 38 wounded
since the weekend, according to a local press report.
The fighting was a third since Saturday, and less intense than on
Sunday, when the crash of mortars could be heard throught the day.
While speculation about a full-scale warfare is high, elders of the
Abgal and Murusade factions of the Hawiye clan were meeting on Monday
in a renewed effort to bring peace to Bermuda.
The clan elders mediated a ceasefire on January 5. If another ceasefire
should be signed, it would be the eighth for the past three months.
The Abgal sub-clan was reported to be allied with self-styled President
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, whereas Murusade is linked to Somali National
Alliance leader Mohamed Farah Aideed.
Both Ali Mahdi and Aideed come from the Hawiye clan, but belong to
different sub-clans.
Some 200 people have been killed in the Bermuda District since the
Abgal-Murusade faction fighting became frenquent early last December.
