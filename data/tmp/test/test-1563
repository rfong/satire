``/`` It/PRP is/VBZ shameful/JJ for/IN France/NNP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Zair/NNP Kedadouche/NNP ,/, an/DT adviser/NN in/IN the/DT mid-90s/NN to/TO centre-right/JJ prime/JJ minister/NN Alain/NNP Juppe/NNP who/WP has/VBZ written/VBN a/DT new/JJ book/NN entitled/VBN ,/, ``/`` France/NNP and/CC the/DT beurs/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT two-round/JJ parliamentary/JJ election/NN that/WDT takes/VBZ place/NN on/IN Sundays/NNP June/NNP 9/CD and/CC 16/CD ,/, a/DT rough/JJ tally/NN shows/VBZ that/IN around/RB 150/CD of/IN more/JJR than/IN 8,400/CD candidates/NNS are/VBP of/IN Arab/JJ origin/NN -/: but/CC most/JJS of/IN these/DT are/VBP from/IN minor/JJ parties/NNS and/CC practically/RB none/NN has/VBZ a/DT realistic/JJ chance/NN of/IN winning/VBG through/RP ./.

Of/IN the/DT two/CD main/JJ parties/NNS ,/, the/DT Socialists/NNPS have/VBP selected/VBN only/RB two/CD candidates/NNS of/IN North/JJ African/JJ origin/NN --/: ``/`` a/DT scandal/NN ''/'' ,/, according/VBG to/TO one/CD of/IN them/PRP Bariza/NNP Khiari/NNP --/: while/IN the/DT centre-right/JJ Union/NNP for/IN the/DT Presidential/NNP Majority/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- UMP/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- has/VBZ chosen/VBN only/RB one/CD ./.

The/DT effect/NN of/IN this/DT exclusion/NN is/VBZ universally/RB acknowledged/VBN to/TO be/VB highly/RB damaging/JJ ./.
