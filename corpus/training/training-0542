Media group attacks Croatia over press freedom 
A journalists' association Monday accused Croatia of ignoring
guidelines on press freedom drawn up by the Council of Europe, the
pan-European body which Croatia will formally join later this week.
Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters without Borders) said in a
communique published here that Zagreb had taken no account of the
recommendations.
Authorities "continue to control national radio and television with an
iron grip and to pursue the rare independent media," it said.
"Tomorrow, they will be able to boast of their membership of the
community of democratic European states while continuing to harrass
dissident or simply impertinent voices."
Croatia is to become the 40th member state of the Council of Europe at
a ceremony here on Wednesday.
In agreeing Zagreb's membership, the Council earlier said it had
complied with a series of conditions which included voting into law a
bill on freedom of the press.
However two journalists on a weekly paper in the port of Split are
still awaiting an appeal against their acquittal on charges of
libelling Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, Reporters Sans Frontieres
noted.
