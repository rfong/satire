British Airways meets with pilots' union over pay dispute 
British Airways and the pilots' union entered talks Tuesday amid rising
hopes of a deal to avert an indefinite walkout by pilots that would
cripple the airline's services at the height of the summmer season.
The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), which has come up with
a new set of proposals to settle a pay dispute with British Airways,
said that it was "hopeful that it can be resolved."
But the union, which counts more than 80 percent of the 3,500 BA pilots
among its members, underlined that an indefinite strike scheduled to
begin next Tuesday would go ahead if the negotiations broke down.
BA flight crews belonging to BALPA voted overwhelmingly last week to
launch industrial action over a management pay and pensions package.
