Individual Income Taxes Up 84 Percent in First Four Months 
China collected 3.3 billion yuan (about 389 million US dollars) in
individual income tax in the first four months of this year, 84.5
percent more than the figure in the same 1994 period, according to the
State Administration of Taxation (AST).
Tax collection increased in all provinces, municipalities, and
autonomous regions of the Chinese mainland except the Tibet Autonomous
Region, the AST said.
Twenty-four of them saw individual income tax revenues rising by more
than 40 percent between January and April, with that in ten of them
more than doubled, the AST said, adding that central China's Henan
Province registered the biggest increase of 269.2 percent in the
period.
The top five sources of individual income tax were south China's
Guangdong Province, Beijing, Shanghai, northeast China's Liaoning
Province, and southeast China's Fujian Province. Guangdong alone
provided some 619.2 million yuan (about 73 million US dollars),
accounting for 18.8 percent of the national total.
Last year China collected more than 7.2 billion yuan (about 852 million
US dollars) in individual income tax, which was an increase of 54.9
percent over the previous year.
In spite of this immense recent increase, AST officials say that
individual income tax evasion is still widespread, largely because of
lax law enforcement and lack of awareness of the need to pay the tax.
The tax was introduced in 1980 but was never really implemented until
last year when China revised its Individual Income Tax Law.
The new law has graduated tax rates from five to 45 percent, with
taxable rate starting at 800 yuan (about 95 US dollars) a month and
going up to earnings of 100,000 yuan (about 11,834 US dollars) or more
a month.
