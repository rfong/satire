Agri-giant ADM to pay 100 million dollars in price-fixing suits 
US agricultural giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) announced Monday
that it had agreed to plead guilty and pay a total of 100 million
dollars to settle two lawsuits over price-fixing charges.
ADM has been the target of a four-year federal probe of alleged
price-fixing in the sale of two corn byproducts: lysine, an amino acid
used by farmers to enhance the growth of swine and poultry, and citric
acid, which is used in soft drinks and detergents.
Under the agreement, ADM is to pay a fine of 70 million dollars in
connection with the lysine case and 30 million dollars in connection
with the citric acid case.
In a communique released from its headquarters in Decatur, central
Illinois, ADM said the deal with the Justice Department "will resolve
all pending criminal investigations of the company."
"This agreement constitutes a global resolution of all matters between
the Department of Justice and ADM and brings to a close all Department
of Justice investigations of alleged misconduct by ADM, including the
government's investigation of the high fructose corn syrup product
line," the 12 billion dollar grain processing giant added.
"With this mattter behind it, ADM will now be able to focus exclusively
on growing its business and maximizing shareholder value," the company
said.
