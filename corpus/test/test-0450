Rabid Bat Found In Surrey
A Bat found in an alley in Surrey has tested positive for rabies which
can effect both humans and animals. I was gobsmacked on account of
having seen the mother-in-law 2 days ago. I had no idea she could cover
this kind of space in such a short time. Her brooms behind the kitchen
door as well.....must be using a spare.
The animal is apparently carrying European Bat Lyssavirus which is
closely linked to the Classic Rabies Virus. I hate to be the only
dissenting voice but the only thing it's carrying is father-in-law's
cheque book and a razor-sharp tongue. Horrible!!
Father-in-law had the skeet club round one evening. As it took off and
pointed it's broom south, they fired a barage that would have brought
the Hindenburg down. Nothing...right miffed an' all we were I can tell
you. Mind you they did total that moggy at the back....but I
digress....
Anyhow, apparently a member of the public in Staines found the old bat
and it was tested in Weybridge Veterinary Clinic in Surrey. I can just
picture those daft vets trying to wrestle with Her Nibs : "Madam pull
yourself towards yourself...this won't hurt a bit.....feck it!!! It bit
me!!! NOW HEAR THIS!! If you don't keep still we're going to put you
down....do you hear me!!!"
In February scientists found that Bats posed only a minor threat of
passing rabies onto humans. These scientists will be able to inform
them that this old bat passes things far more sinister onto humans like
tons and tons of fecking emotional guilt trips the old sow.
I remember one friday refusing to take her cauldron outside. The
members of her coven like to pop in for a cook and a chinwag. Spent an
entire evening listening to her cast spells on me...old bat can't spell
at the best of time.... and what about those warts? Gordon Bennett she
looks like the invasion of the body snatchers all on her lonesome...and
she picks them...."..more custard dear?"
Mind you these scientists were Scottish...you know the lads who brought
you the 10 million squid parliament building with the 600 million squid
overrun? And from the geniuses that brought you Holyrood now meet Bats
R Us an' safe.
You can picture Hamish McGotitwrongagain lecturing to his colleauges :
"Och as ye can see the wee bat rests upon ma finger an' no
probleaaaaaaaaarrrggghhhh!!!!!!!" Then the rest of this class of
geniuses write to tell the world no rabies were passed. Of course they
forget to mention that wee Hamish died and their findings were done at
the post mortem.
"Och his liver is fine no infection...bladder seems okay...does anyone
know if the bat swallowed his finger or did we lose it on the floor?"
Another bunch of geniuses at DEFRA say we musn't handle a sick or
ailing bat but seek their advice. I'll just step lightly over it and
head home if that's no trouble.
Then they say anyone bitten or scratched should seek medical attention.
Yer!! Like me.....aaaaaaarrrrgh I've been bittennnnnn!!!! These fecking
things kill just by the way and no Scot with a doctors coat and sign
marked "VET" will tell me otherwise. Go finish your parliament or
something!
