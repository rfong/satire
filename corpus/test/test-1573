Floods Caused by Heavy Rains Maroon 100,000 People 
Torrential rains ended a five-month drought in Bangladesh, but also
flooded coastal areas and marooned 100,000 people, officials said
Tuesday.
The downpour, that began Monday, was spawned by a depression in the Bay
of Bengal which whipped up a five-foot tidal wave that flooded dozens
of villages along the southern coast.
At least 400 huts were washed away by the tidal surge that also
destroyed shrimps and salt farms in the area, an official at Cox's
Bazar contacted by phone said. Cox's Bazar is 296 kilometers (185
miles) south of Dhaka.
At least 10,000 people were trapped inside their homes in dozens of
flooded villages, the official at Cox's Bazar cyclone warning center
said. No casualties were immediately reported.
The rains, however, brought cheer because it ended a drought in the
low-lying delta nation. ``The rains will be good for the rice crops,
especially in the northern region,'' said Sajedur Rahman, deputy
director at Dhaka's Meteorological Department.
The government estimated that 1.7 million tons of rice crop would be
lost because of the drought. A heat wave has killed at two people.
