Chrysler doubles first quarter profits 
Chrysler Corp. on Tuesday reported first-quarter after-tax earnings of
1.005 billion dollars compared with 496 million dollars in the same
period last year.
Net earnings per share increased to 2.64 dollars from 1.33 dollars a
year earlier.
The third-largest US automaker said its net earnings and earnings per
share were the best first quarter results ever recorded.
Pre-tax earnings in the period of 1.67 billion dollars, an increase of
700 million dollars or 72 percent over the first quarter last year,
were the highest in the company's history.
"The year got off to a stronger start than we expected with
first-quarter industry sales in the US running at an annual rate of
15.7 million units," said Chrysler chairman Robert Eaton.
"The spring market looks very solid and we are increasing our US
industry sales forecast for the 1996 calendar year to 15.3 million
units -- up from 15.1 million previously.
"Despite all of the weather problems in the first quarter, our retail
sales still showed a healthy increase as compared to last year. Our
share of the US and Canadian new vehicle marketplace jumped from 15
percent in the first quarter of 1995 to 16.3 percent in the first
quarter of 1996."
The company also reported:
-- Total revenues were 15 billion dollars for first-quarter 1996, a new
first-quarter record and an increase of 1.4 billion dollars, or 10
percent, over first-quarter 1995 total revenues of 13.6 billion
dollars.
-- Net earnings as a percent of total revenues increased to 6.7 percent
in first-quarter 1996, compared with 3.6 percent a year earlier.
-- International retail sales in first-quarter were 53,243 vehicles, up
41 percent over first-quarter 1995 sales of 37,721 vehicles. In Europe,
Chrysler sold 24,302 vehicles, an increase of 38 percent over 17,590
vehicles in first-quarter 1995.
-- Chrysler repurchased 332 million dollars of its common stock in the
first quarter of 1996. The company planned a two billion dollar common
stock buyback for 1996, subject to market and general economic
conditions. Chrysler completed a one billion dollar common stock
repurchase in 1995.
