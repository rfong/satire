Montenegro's Party Coalitions Reach Accord on Independence Referendum 
Montenegro's pro-independence coalition "Victory Belongs to Montenegro"
led by President Milo Djukanovic Monday reached with the Liberal Party
an agreement on holding a referendum on Montenegro's independence.
Under the agreement, within 60 days of its formation, the Assembly
(parliament) of the Montenegro Republic would decide on the referendum,
which is to be held in six months when the decision is made.
In the April parliamentary election, the pro-independence " Victory
Belongs to Montenegro" coalition won 36 seats in the 77- seat assembly,
while the anti-independence party coalition " Together with Yugoslavia"
won 33. The Liberal Party picked up six seats and the two small ethnic
Albanian parties went away with one seat each.
However, the pro-independence coalition can neither form a cabinet on
its own, nor hold the referendum on independence because both require a
two-third parliamentary majority.
To break the impasse, Djukanovic's pro-independence movement offered to
give the position of assembly president to the Liberal Party in
exchange for the latter's support for its efforts to form a minority
cabinet.
This compromise was reached through repeated haggling between the two
sides when the negotiation on establishing a coalition government had
bogged down for more than a month.
Over the past years Montenegro's government led by Djukanovic has
threatened to break away with Yugoslavia amid increasingly acute
conflicts with the federal government.
