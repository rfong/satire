Gun battle follows start of US transfer of prisoners to Cuba
The US transfer of prisoners to Cuba from the Afghan campaign got off to a
dramatic start in an exchange of gunfire as Afghan authorities pushed ahead
with plans Friday to get weapons off the streets of Kabul.
The attack underlined the fragile post-war climate in the ravaged
nation as the interim government claimed success in reducing the number
of armed troops gathered in Kabul.
Unidentified attackers, on foot and under cover of darkness, penetrated
the perimeter of the base at Kandahar airport late Thursday and US
troops responded with machine gun and small arms fire, US officials
said.
The attack came eight minutes after a C-17 transport plane took off
from the southern city's airport, carrying the first group of about 20
prisoners to a US base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, military officials said
Friday. Officials earlier estimated a 20 minute gap between the plane's
take-off and the start of shooting.
US officers in Khandahar insisted the exchange of fire between Marines
based at the airport and "enemy forces" was not related to the despatch
of the prisoners.
"The contact started with some illumination flares that were launched
over the perimeter towards the runway where we had aircraft on the
ground," Captain Dan Greenwood told reporters at a briefing at the
base. He adding it was believed "probably eight to 14 enemy forces" had
been involved.
"Over the next 30 to 40 minutes it accelerated with small arms fire and
machine gun fire on the northwestern flank," Greenwood said.
The Marines did not suffer any casualties in the exchange of fire,
which began at 1600 GMT, and it was not known if there had been any
casualties among the attackers.
"The whole situation remained tense for about four hours," he added.
Amnesty International condemned reported plans for the prisoners to be
chained to their aircraft seats under the care of specially trained
guards armed with stun guns.
The human rights watchdog described as "worrying" reports that they
would be in manacles, possibly hooded and not allowed to leave their
seats for any reason during the 20-hour flight to Cuba.
The gunfight illustrated that Afghanistan remains volatile after the
defeat of the Taliban regime in December by the US-led coalition forces
and local Northern Alliance militias.
US forces are continuing their hunt for Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born
radical said to have masterminded the September 11 attacks on US
targets that left more than 3,000 dead, and any of his al-Qaeda
loyalists still at large in Afghanistan.
Also on the wanted list is Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar and
other senior regime figures, who gave shelter to al-Qaeda and refused
to hand bin Laden over to the United States after September 11.
In the capital Kabul, Afghan military units were withdrawing to
barracks after being ordered off the streets by the country's new
rulers.
Between 5,000 and 6,000 Northern Alliance soldiers have left Kabul over
the past three days, a senior interior ministry official said.
"Around five or six thousand soldiers have left Kabul. More will leave
Kabul in a week," General Din Mohammad Jurhat, the interior ministry's
senior security official in Kabul, told AFP.
"Another five or six thousand divided between the police and the
military will remain," he said.
Interior Minister Yunus Qanooni had Wednesday ordered the Afghan
military to quit Kabul within three days and leave security duties in
the capital to Afghan police and an international security force.
The first contingent of German troops joining the British-led
International Security Assistance Force arrived at Bagram air base on
Friday, German Lieutenant Colonel Robert Pelzl told AFP.
The troops, the first of a 70-strong German advance party expected in
coming days, arrived aboard a military C-130 Hercules aircraft at
Bagram, 50 kilometres (31 miles) north of Kabul, he said.
Some 30 Dutch soldiers were also reported to have arrived in the
country, but Pelzl was unable to confirm their presence.
The UN-mandated security force to be joined by troops from 18 nations
is already more than 1,000-strong and is expected to swell to 5,000 by
the middle of next month. Bulgaria is the latest nation to join the
force, which will provide security in Afghanistan over six months as
the nation tries to resume some degree of normalcy after more than two
decades of war.
