Zapatista leader Marcos vents frustration, warns war could heat up 
The leader of the Mexican Zapatista rebel movement said Tuesday that
peace talks with the government were at an impasse and warned
hostilities could resume in the south of the country.
In a statement, rebel leader Subcomandante Marcos said the dialogue
with government negotiators had been "exhausted" and said fighting
could "resume at any time."
But while Marcos said the dialogue had hit a wall, he did not state
explicitly that the rebels saw the peace process as broken off or over,
or if the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) would be
represented at the next round of peace talks set for September 5 in San
Andres Larrainzar.
The indigenous ethnic Maya-based EZLN rose up against the government
January 1, 1994 demanding better social and economic conditions in
Chiapas state, one of the country's poorest. The rebels later expanded
their demands to include nationwide democratic political reforms.
A truce generally has held since a few weeks after the original
uprising, and negotiations have been under way, at fits and starts, in
a new round since April.
"In the Mexican southeast there is a war," said Marcos, who grumbled
that the federal "government delegation was composed of the historical
heirs of the old conquistadors."
