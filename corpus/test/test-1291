Myanmar Reorganizes Industrial Development Committee 
Myanmar's Industry Development Committee (IDC) has been reorganized
with Minister for Science and Technology U Thaung designated as its
chairman.
The official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar said today that the IDC
was reconstituted following the formation of the State Peace and
Development Council (SPDC), Myanmar's governing body, last month.
The IDC chairmanship was previously held by former Minister for
Agriculture and Irrigation Myint Aung On.
At a coordination meeting here Thursday, SPDC Second Secretary Tin Oo
urged the IDC to accelerate its work and reorganize the working
committee to implement industrial projects.
Quoting SPDC Chairman Than Shwe, Tin Oo reiterated the country's five
industrial development objectives -- development of agro-based
industries, qualitative and quantitative improvement of industrial
products, production of new industrial products, manufacture of
industrial equipment and acquisition of good opportunities for the
nation's industrialization.
The Myanmar IDC was first formed in July 1995 to promote the
development of the country's industries.
According to official statistics, Myanmar's industrial growth reached
5.2 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year, the first fiscal of the
country's present five-year plan. Myanmar has set a target of
10.7-percent growth for the industrial sector in 1997-98, the second
fiscal year of the plan.
Statistics also show that the industrial sector accounts for only 9.2
percent of the gross domestic product while the agricultural sector
makes up the lion's share.
The government has called for greater efforts for promoting the private
sector's involvement in the industrial sector and for establishing
industrial zones throughout the country, especially in the capital of
Yangon, to attract foreign investments to the sector.
