Gordon Brown faces bankruptcy for Blair's IRA debts
UK prime Monster Gorgon Brown faces an imminent wipe out in a criminal
bankruptcy lawsuit for the settlement of over £250 billion of his
predecessor's IRA Piss Process debts.
Tony Blair's fetid deal with the assorted ragbag of disaffected
molesters who banded together under the IRA flagship of convenienece
has slowly fallen apart.
Treasury mandarins have calculated that the total asset base of
Monarchial Crown Estate-related asstets which Blair authorised to be
liquidated in his ten year Drowning Street garage boot sale exceeds the
entire market value of UK oil giant BP.
One third of the revenue raised came from straightforward Provisional
IRA deals connected to doshing up and empowering former child molester
inmates who served jail time with Blair in the early 1970s before
reinventing themslves as freedom fighters.
Another third of the revenue is sourced directly to Al-Qaeda type of
foreign terrorists who changed tack from sex crimes to grand larceny
after finding bribery of the British Government to be a relative sinch.
The remaining 33% relates to second and third generation of cold war
fascists who rapidly became self-invented Russian oligarchs after
getting the nod from their digusting C-in-C Boris Yeltsin.
"We give Gorgon Brown until mid week," a Serious & Disorganised Crime
Agency source promised, "and then Wham! it's straight in the slammer
with all the front benches."
Alistair Campbell is a sucker for punishment.
