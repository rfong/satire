Y2K Problem Resolved in Sea Ports, Shipping Businesses
A special inspection team of officials and experts from the ministries
of information industry and communications recently toured ports and
transport enterprises in east China's Shanghai and Ningbo cities and
the north China port city of Tianjin, saying that they are confident
the sea ports and ocean shipping enterprises will enter safely into the
year 2000.
Shanghai and Ningbo ports have resolved the Y2K problem in all large
computer systems and the effort has passed assessment. The China Ocean
Shipping Corporation (COSCO), the country's leading sea transport
enterprise, has tested and revised more than 5,200 computers and other
equipment vulnerable to Y2K.
Feng said that China's sea ports and ocean fleets have drawn up
emergency contingency plans to cope with Y2K accidents, and rehearsals
of the plans are continuing.
The Y2K millennium bug stems from the way that early computer
programmers used only the last two digits of the four-digit year number
in an effort to save memory. In this sense, computers may take the year
2000 as 1900, and disorders will occur.
