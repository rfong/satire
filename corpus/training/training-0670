Hostages pour out of Budennovsk hospital 
Hundreds of freed hostages poured out of the hospital in Budennovsk in
southern Russia on Monday after their Chechen captors left under a deal
worked out with the Russian government.
The hostages left the hospital, where they had been held since
Wednesday, as soon as the Chechen guerrillas, who were demanding an end
to the war in Chechnya, left for Chechnya with safety guarantees from
the government.
The guerrillas left in seven buses, accompanied by about 150 volunteers
and hostages guaranteeing their safety.
The guerrillas left for southern Chechnya, more than 300 kilometres
(190 miles) away at 4:02 p.m. (1202 GMT) in buses with drawn curtains
driving at about 45 kmh (28 mph).
The guerrillas agreed to free the hundreds of hostages they had held
since Wednesday after Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin promised to
guarantee the fighters' safe return to Chechnya, a ceasefire in the
six-month war in the Caucasus republic and negotiations with
independence fighters.
A ceasefire was ordered late Sunday by the commander of Russian troops
in Chechnya and negotiations began in the Russian-held capital of
Chechnya Grozny on Monday.
