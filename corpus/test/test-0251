At least 12 dead in huge bomb blast in northern Iraq 
At least 12 people were killed including two UN guards when a huge bomb
ripped through a petrol station in Kurdish-held northern Iraq on
Thursday, UN officials said.
Ten civilians and two guards, a Polish national and a Filipino (eds:
correct), died in the attack in the mountain town of Shaqlawa, said
Stafford Clarry, head of the UN Iraq Relief Coordination Unit.
"More bodies are believed to be in the wreckage and searches are
continuing," he said.
The UN sector commander for the main town of Arbil said a powerful
bomb, believed to be a remote-controlled device, exploded as two UN
vehicles were driving past the petrol station.
"The blast was so powerful that it lifted one of the vehicles
completely off the ground and totally destroyed both of them," said the
UN guard chief, who asked not to be named.
"We believe it was a remote-controlled device and that it was a
deliberate attack against the United Nations, but we are still
investigating."
Around 30 people, including a third UN guard, were injured and the
petrol station was flattened, he added.
UN guards have been posted in northern Iraq since Kurds took over the
region in defiance of Baghdad in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.
The two UN jeeps based in Arbil were driving through Shaqlawa, 50
kilometres (30 miles) away, on a regular patrol when the bomb exploded.
Clarry said the petrol station belonged to the Save the Children fund,
a British non-governmental organisation.
The Iraqi National Congress, a coalition of opposition groups, said
earlier that the blast happened when a UN tanker truck used to bring
petrol from Baghdad to a petrol station exploded in a fireball.
