Lebanon's Work Force Stages One-Day Warning Strike 
Tens of thousands of workers staged a one-day strike Tuesday demanding
higher pay, bringing much of the country to a standstill.
Schools, banks, businesses and an estimated 40 percent of shops were
closed in Beirut and its environs. The capital's busy port was closed
and airport staff called a one-hour symbolic stoppage, despite
government warnings.
Soaring inflation since the 1975-1990 civil war has made life much more
expensive for Lebanon's 4 million people, who are already grappling
with the mammoth task of rebuilding their country.
Although the walkout was less than paralyzing, it underlined the
discontent among many Lebanese at the government's failure to
rejuvenate the economy or even to restore basic amenities like
electricity and water.
The General Federation of Labor Trade Unions, which represents some
350,000 workers, wants Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's government to
deliver pay hikes to to counter the battering salaries took from
inflation.
The federation estimates inflation is running at a rate of 80 percent a
year. The government insists inflation has not exceeded 12 percent this
year.
The army and police set up scores of checkpoints at key intersections,
with squads patrolling the streets to prevent any trouble. None was
reported.
