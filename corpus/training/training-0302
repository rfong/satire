Khmer Rouge leader -- possibly Pol Pot -- said hospitalized in China 
One of the shadowy figures behind Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas,
possibly the notorious Pol Pot himself, is seriously ill in a Beijing
hospital, a Japanese daily reported Wednesday quoting diplomatic
sources.
The Sankei newspaper said that either Pol Pot -- the fanatical Maoist
blamed for the death of one million Cambodians during his rule in the
1970s -- or his deputy Nuon Chea was hospitalized in Beijing, quoting a
diplomatic source in Phnom Penh.
It also quoted a Western diplomat as saying that Pol Pot had been
hospitalized in Thailand, but that his illness was so serious that he
was transferred to Beijing.
Pol Pot was at the helm of the Khmer Rouge regime during its brutal
rule over Cambodia in 1975-1979 when more than one million people
perished.
Although Khieu Samphan is officially the head of the Khmer Rouge
faction, its paramount leader remains Pol Pot.
According to military sources in Bangkok, Pol Pot has been having heart
problems, the newspaper said.
The guerrilla leader is also believed to suffer from liver ailments
associated with malaria and other illness contracted from years of
jungle fighting.
