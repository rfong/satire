Whistleblower gives evidence in doping trial 
Sandro Donati, an official with the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI)
who has made outspoken comments about doping in sport, was the
principal witness Tuesday as the trial of alleged doping mastermind
Doctor Michele Ferrari resumed.
Donati told the court that in 1996 he had seen a prescription for
banned substances with Ferrari's stamp on it and giving the address to
the recipient of a pharmacist in Bologna.
He explained that the drugs administered were potentially hazardous to
an athlete's health. "They are a stimulant and on the illustrated
information that comes with (the drugs) it is written that they can
cause cardiac problems," Donati explained to the court.
Donati, who first denounced the doping he considers rife in Italian
sport in 1994, claims he has become a marked man since speaking out.
Two cyclists - Axel Merckx and Gianluca Bortolami - had been slated to
give evidence on Tuesday but did not. Merckng resumed on Tuesday the
prosecution had been boosted by a ruling by judge Maurizio Passarini
who ruled that they could use intercepted phone calls in evidence
despite attempts by the defence to have them declared inadmissible.
Documents submitted to the court say that in one call the Bologna
pharmacist is heard to say: "Ferrari came to visit and he has emptied
(the stock at) my pharmacy."
Ferrari, who numbers three-times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong
among his clients although the American rider is not named in any court
documents in this case, is contesting charges that he knowingly
administered illegal products to cyclists.
The case continues and will resume on February 12.
