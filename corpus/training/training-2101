Freed Polish Hostages Back Home 
Five Polish aid workers held hostage by Chechen kidnappers two months
ago flew home Thursday morning, a report of the Polish Press Agency
said.
When meeting the five workers, Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said
his government is always ready to help Poles abroad.
The five were abducted on December 17 while delivering humanitarian aid
materials to a village in the Northern Caucasus republic. They were
freed by Chechen security forces on Monday.
A report of the central television station said the Polish police
identified one of the five freed hostages as an economic crime suspect.
He probably will be taken into custody soon.
