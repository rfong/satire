OAPEC Organizes Gas Seminar in Qatar 
A seminar of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OAPEC) on developing natural gas industry was opened in the Qatari
capital Doha on Monday.
Around 50 Arab and foreign experts will discuss 17 working papers on
natural gas during the two-day seminar, the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
Abdul Aziz Al-Turki, secretary general of the Kuwait-based OAPEC, said
the participants will discuss the technology in liquidating and
exporting gas.
Turki said gas reserve of the Arab countries was estimated at 32.6
trillion cubic meters later last year, some 30 percent of global
reserve.
However, he said, Arab states were marketing only 226 billion cubic
meters of gas, or 10 percent of the total global marketing.
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry Abdullah Bin Hamad al-Attiya
said the seminar would play a leading role in developing gas industry.
He said that since exporting gas to the world major markets was costly,
gas industrialists have been focusing their attention in recent years
on reducing investment and operational costs.
