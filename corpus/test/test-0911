A King And His Compatriots: Creepy, Creepier And Creepiest
Halloween may still be weeks away, but the celebration of the scary
season has already begun in downtown Hartford. The old G. Fox
department store building on Main Street has been converted into
``Haunted Happenings,'' promisingly billed as Connecticut's largest
spook house.
And at the Hartford Stage Company on nearby Church Street, there's
another ghoulish divertissement, for those who prefer their gore and
goblins mixed with blank verse and medieval history. It is called
``Richard III.''
As conceived by Mark Lamos, the company's artistic director, this
production features the gifted Richard Thomas working hard to find the
Freddy Krueger in Shakespeare's meanest monarch.
This is no icy, insinuating Machiavelli of a king, in the manner of
Laurence Olivier or, more recently, Ian McKellen. No, Thomas wears his
psychosis very visibly on his back, which has as exaggeratedly convex a
hump as you're ever likely to see.
His choirboy face distorted with furry eyebrows and his hair abristle
in an electric-shock cut, Thomas is made up to frighten the horses.
Limping furiously through Christine Jones' futuristic rusting metal box
of a set, the actor scales up every dark element in Richard's tortured
soul, with black irony and sadistic sexuality writ very, very large.
This is an egomaniac who is all unleashed id, and the entire production
seems to take place on some nasty, frenzied plane of the unconscious.
The idea seems to have been to capitalize on Thomas' boundless energy
and pulsing stage presence, brilliantly used to create a refreshingly
nonpassive Richard II in Washington last year.
But to exaggerate Richard III's duplicity and demonic qualities as
Thomas does is simply to caricature caricature, and the construct
explodes early on.
He is so unhinged from the fabled opening monologue, in which he
italicizes every ``I'' with a rasping breath, that there's no room for
this Richard to unravel, which robs the play of its essential
trajectory.
And even the honeyed words he uses in his connivings to reach the
throne are pitched at the level of a rant. He dominates by sheer
brutality and intimidation, not political manipulation, and it's
impossible to believe that anyone would be deceived by him.
This may be Lamos' point. He has spoken about the innate corruption of
most of the play's characters and, on this level, Richard can be seen
as a grotesque manifestation of the bankrupt social currency they all
deal in. Accordingly, the world portrayed here is one big chamber of
horrors inhabited by singularly creepy denizens.
Queen Elizabeth (Gordana Rashovich) and Lady Anne (Orlagh Casidy) are
pale, spidery women in sinuous black dresses who wouldn't be out of
place waiting attendance on Bela Lugosi. (When the bereaved Elizabeth
beseeches the souls of her dead children to ``hover about me with your
airy wings,'' you expect to see bats.)
The doom-saying Margaret (Joan Copeland) appears as a ghoulish bag
lady, who pronounces her curses with spooky high-tech amplification.
The assassins (John Cayer and Peter Von Berg) hired by Richard to kill
his brother Clarence (played with crisply spoken dignity by Peter
Francis James) are cartoon thugs out of ``A Clockwork Orange,'' replete
with bowler hats and butcher aprons.
And Tyrrel (John Bolger), the murderer of the princes in the tower,
slithers around like Dracula's Renfield in search of edible insects.
The real problem is that most of these people remain abstract; they
play emotions (with a lot of tremolo in their voices), but they don't
really create specific characters. The exceptions, aside from Thomas,
are Ms. Copeland, who suggests the roots of dispossession behind
Margaret's rage, and John Michael Higgins (the Jeffrey of Paul
Rudnick's ``Jeffrey'') as Richard's ally, the ambitious Duke of
Buckingham.
Higgins brings an oddly detached flippancy to his part that makes you
expect him to say, ``Hi, I'm your waiter, Buckingham,'' but he can be
entertaining.
So, of course, can Thomas. His performance is game and brave, and in
the final scenes where he spurs his troops to battle, you get a sense
of the compelling will and energy of a warped man born to lead.
But most of the pleasures afforded by the performance and the
production are of a campier nature, with Thomas ringing some funny,
outlandishly perverse variations on the seduction of Lady Anne and the
scene in which the head of foolish Hastings ( Bolger) is delivered to
him (in this case, in a garbage bag).
In fact, this ``Richard III'' is less apt to chill than to titillate,
in the winking tradition of contemporary horror movies. When the
murderous king's corpse (clad in spiked leather armor that makes Thomas
look a bit like a Ninja turtle) lies center stage at the play's end,
the soldiers back away very carefully as if they expect it to spring to
life again, just like the killer demons of ``Halloween'' and ``Friday
the 13th.''
