AFP and WTN in media link-up 
Agence France-Presse  and the Worldwide Television News (WTN) of
the United States signed an agreement here Friday for closer
cooperation between the two news organisations.
Under the agreement, WTN will supply its still pictures, derived from
its world-wide news and entertainment coverage, for distribution within
the AFP international photo service.
AFP and WTN will also work for a closer cooperation in the field and
share a number of bureaux commencing with Beirut and Havana.
AFP will carry on its French news wires WTN's advisories, outlooks and
flashes for WTN subscribers.
"We are delighted to expand our cooperation with WTN. Our two
organisations are complementary," said AFP's Director General Jean
Miot.
"The WTN still images are of the highest quality and will be of real
value to our international picture service.
"We will continue to work closely to further our commercial, logistical
and editorial interests."
Kenneth Coyte, WTN's chairman commented: "I'm sure that our continued
cooperation will strengthen both our organisations.
"I am also confident that the technology we are using to produce
quality still images will enable WTN to become a major supplier to the
stills market."
The immediacy of television news enables WTN to produce still pictures
from its video within minutes of its delivery to London via satellite.
From the video still images are selected via traditional "video grab"
software and then put through an enhancement process to provide high
quality pictures.

countries.

German, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic) 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year, covering politics, economics, diplomacy, human interest and
