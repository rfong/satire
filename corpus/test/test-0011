San Diego Feeling Super About Outbreak Of Charger Fever
The two boys at Fulton Elementary School were taught a lesson recently.
They showed up for school wearing their San Francisco 49ers T-shirts
and were promptly sent to the principal's office.
Principal Janice Roudebush taped paper lightning bolts to the boys'
shirts, then had them listen to the disco-era San Diego Chargers' fight
song and learn the lyrics.
The good-natured prank backfired the next day when the school was
deluged with angry phone calls.
``Unfortunately, it was not seen as humorous,'' Roudebush said. ``It
was seen as discipline and children not having freedom of speech or
choice.''
The incident underscores the fine line San Diego has straddled between
enthusiasm and fanaticism since the Chargers defeated the Pittsburgh
Steelers two weeks ago and earned the right to face the 49ers in
today's Super Bowl XXIX in Miami.
And by nearly any objective measure, the city known more for its golf
courses and laid-back image has reached an unprecedented level of
can-you-top-this boosterism for the beloved Chargers.
Its overzealous Super Bowl-week behavior resembles what might be
expected from sports-mad towns like Cleveland or Pittsburgh, but
certainly not staid San Diego.
Many of the city's skyscrapers feature lightning bolts or banners
supporting the Chargers. None is gaudier than the Wells Fargo building
on Front Street. It features a flashing bolt that stretches diagonally
across the entire high rise.
If you try to locate B Street, good luck. It has been rechristened
``Bolt Street'' by the city, with lightning bolts covering street
signs.
It is impossible to avoid the omnipresent bolt, which has become the
symbol of the city.
Local TV anchors wear politically correct lightning bolt pins, in case
you forget which team they are rooting for. One station went so far as
to place a giant bolt in front of its anchor desk. All of the city's
fire-engine red trolleys sport yellow bolts.
The adobe-style Nordstrom at the upscale Horton Plaza shopping center
even fell victim with an out-of-character neon bolt above the entrance.
Local barbers will shave bolts into your head for $10. Homeless people
are selling Chargers bolt buttons for $3. Editorials endorse Chargers
coach Bobby Ross as Man of the Year.
And it's not just limited to the city. The suburb of Chula Vista held a
recent City Council meeting with a Chargers flag adorning the chambers.
No physical display is deemed too outlandish, as long as it supports
the Chargers. About 60,000 are expected at Jack Murphy Stadium to watch
the Super Bowl on large video screens. Tickets were free but are being
sold by scalpers for as much as $15.
``I've never seen anything like it,'' said Roudebush, who has lived in
San Diego since 1966. ``I've not seen this kind of support for an
athletic team. It has really pulled the community together.''
NBC announcer Charlie Jones, who has lived in nearby La Jolla for 28
years and called Chargers games when the team played at the old Balboa
Stadium, said the enthusiasm has ``caught everybody off guard.''
``It's just like a great big bear hug, and everyone in the city is
included in the hug,'' Jones said. ``We get no respect, and it's
manifested itself with this reaction.''
The last time the city acted, or overreacted, for a sports team was in
1984, when the Padres made the World Series, Jones said. He said the
Chargers haven't been this popular since they moved from Los Angeles in
1961.
``Now we're getting back to that feeling,'' Jones said.
There haven't been many opportunities. Most San Diego sports teams are
best known for their ineptness, including the Padres, San Diego State
and the Clippers, who continued their losing ways in Los Angeles.
Even the local minor-league hockey team, the Gulls, recently announced
it was leaving town for dreaded L.A.
``We've never really had a sports city,'' said Linda Stephens of the
Tierrasanta area, a few miles north of Jack Murphy Stadium. ``This
gives people one less thing to complain about.''
