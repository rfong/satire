Robert/NNP Frasure/NNP ,/, a/DT U.S./NNP deputy/JJ assistant/NN secretary/NN of/IN state/NN ,/, ended/VBD a/DT week/NN of/IN talks/NNS with/IN the/DT powerful/JJ Serbian/NNP president/NN on/IN a/DT plan/NN to/TO swap/VB recognition/NN of/IN Bosnia/NNP for/IN lifting/VBG of/IN economic/JJ sanctions/NNS on/IN Yugoslavia/NNP ./.

Recognition/NNP of/IN Bosnia/NNP would/MD be/VB a/DT blow/NN to/TO rebel/VB Serbs/NNS there/RB and/CC wreck/VB their/PRP$ dream/NN of/IN uniting/VBG all/DT Serbs/NNPS in/IN one/CD country/NN ./.

Milosevic/NNP armed/VBN and/CC financed/VBN the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNP before/IN becoming/VBG a/DT peacemaker/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB sanctions/NNS lifted/VBD ./.

Diplomats/NNS said/VBD the/DT talks/NNS deadlocked/VBN over/IN provisions/NNS for/IN possible/JJ reimposition/NN of/IN sanctions/NNS ./.

Milosevic/NNP wants/VBZ the/DT U.N./NNP Security/NNP Council/NNP to/TO have/VB the/DT final/JJ say/NN ,/, counting/VBG on/IN his/PRP$ ally/NN Russia/NNP 's/POS veto/NN ./.

Milosevic/NNP has/VBZ refused/VBN a/DT U.S./NNP proposal/NN that/IN an/DT independent/JJ group/NN of/IN experts/NNS decide/VBP ,/, if/IN needed/VBD ,/, whether/IN sanctions/NNS should/MD be/VB reintroduced/VBN ./.

In/IN Washington/NNP ,/, a/DT State/NNP Department/NNP spokeswoman/NN confirmed/VBD the/DT talks/NNS had/VBD reached/VBN an/DT impasse/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP certainly/RB Ambassador/NNP Frasure/NNP has/VBZ gotten/VBN as/RB far/RB he/PRP can/MD at/IN this/DT particular/JJ point/NN ,/, ''/'' Christine/NNP Shelley/NNP said/VBD Tuesday/NNP ./.

``/`` We/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB progress/NN to/TO report/VB at/IN this/DT time/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ certainly/RB unfortunate/JJ ./. ''/''

But/CC she/PRP held/VBD out/RP the/DT prospect/NN that/IN a/DT breakthrough/NN was/VBD still/RB possible/JJ ./.

``/`` I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB that/IN we/PRP feel/VBP that/IN the/DT prospect/NN of/IN being/VBG able/JJ to/TO reach/VB agreement/NN with/IN -LRB-/-LRB- Milosevic/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- at/IN some/DT point/NN has/VBZ disappeared/VBN ,/, ''/'' Shelley/NNP said/VBD ./.

Frasure/NNP was/VBD to/TO leave/VB for/IN Washington/NNP Wednesday/NNP and/CC brief/VB the/DT State/NNP Department/NNP about/IN the/DT deadlock/NN and/CC possible/JJ next/JJ moves/NNS ,/, the/DT diplomats/NNS said/VBD ./.

Milosevic/NNP apparently/RB thinks/VBZ that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ scored/VBN a/DT big/JJ negotiating/NN point/NN by/IN pressuring/VBG the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNP to/TO release/VB U.N./NNP hostages/NNS ,/, proving/VBG he/PRP can/MD still/RB influence/VB them/PRP ./.

He/PRP is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO stand/VB firm/NN on/IN his/PRP$ proposal/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD virtually/RB ensure/VB that/IN sanctions/NNS are/VBP never/RB reimposed/VBN ./.

Milosevic/NNP has/VBZ also/RB insisted/VBN on/IN the/DT right/NN of/IN Serb-dominated/JJ Yugoslavia/NNP _/NNP Serbia/NNP and/CC Montenegro/NNP _/NNP to/TO be/VB the/DT legal/JJ successor/NN of/IN the/DT old/JJ Yugoslav/NNP federation/NN which/WDT disintegrated/VBD in/IN war/NN ,/, sources/NNS familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT talks/NNS said/VBD ./.

Yugoslavia/NNP could/MD then/RB claim/VB all/PDT the/DT assets/NNS of/IN the/DT old/JJ six-republic/JJ federation/NN ./.

The/DT sources/NNS said/VBD Milosevic/NNP appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB willing/JJ to/TO drop/VB those/DT demands/NNS in/IN exchange/NN for/IN the/DT full/JJ lifting/NN of/IN a/DT U.N./NNP trade/NN embargo/NN imposed/VBN in/IN 1992/CD for/IN his/PRP$ support/NN of/IN rebel/JJ Serbs/NNS in/IN Bosnia/NNP ./.

Economic/NNP sanctions/NNS have/VBP contributed/VBN to/TO the/DT collapse/NN of/IN the/DT Yugoslav/NNP economy/NN ./.

About/RB half/PDT the/DT workforce/NN is/VBZ unemployed/JJ and/CC production/NN has/VBZ plummeted/VBN ./.

Many/JJ people/NNS live/VBP at/IN or/CC near/IN the/DT poverty/NN line/NN ./.

Serbia/NNP 's/POS ability/NN to/TO bankroll/VB Serb/NNP rebellions/NNS in/IN Bosnia/NNP and/CC Croatia/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN exhausted/VBN by/IN the/DT economic/JJ and/CC political/JJ sanctions/NNS imposed/VBN in/IN May/NNP 1992/CD ./.
