Spain Urges Cooperation Between EU, Mediterranean Nations 
Spain's Foreign Minister Javier Solana today appealed for cooperation
between the European Union (EU) and the countries on the southern
Mediterranean.
Speaking at the opening ceremony of a forum on the challenges EU faces
in the Mediterranean held in Barcelona, Solana said it is now necessary
to establish a new relationship between the two areas.
The forum is to make preparations for a conference of EU members and
the countries on the southern Mediterranean to be held in Barcelona in
fall.
The foreign minister added that the countries to be represented at the
conference should try to understand each other' religion and culture,
overcome their differences and reach an agreement which will last into
the next century and promote regular dialogue.
He also suggested that EU base its policy toward the south
Mediterranean countries on ensuring their political stability through
more economic assistance.
Speaking of the situation in Algeria, the minister believed that it
would not hamper the fall conference in Barcelona.
Instead, it would encourage people to solve terrorism and political and
economic problems in Algeria by political means and dialogue as called
for by the European Union.
