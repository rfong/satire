Britain, Iran to Exchange Ambassadors 
Britain and Iran announced on Tuesday that they had agreed to exchange
ambassadors.
"This step marks the end of years of dispute," British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement.
"It opens the way for us to rebuild a healthy and mutually beneficial
friendship with Iran and to work with Iran in its path of reform and
renewed openness to the outside world," Cook said.
"It fulfills the agreement we secured with the Iranian government in
New York in September 1998," added the Foreign Secretary.
The relationship between Britain and Iran plummeted in 1989 when Tehran
issued a death edict against British writer Salman Rushdie, who wrote
an novel by the name of "The Satanic Verses" which then Iranian leader
said blasphemed Islam.
Nick Browne, charge d'affaires in Tehran in 1989 will be Britain's
ambassador in Iran, a BBC report said.
The Iranian ambassador in London will be Gholamreza Ansari.
