ASEAN Foundation to Convene Workshop
The ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Foundation will hold
a workshop to formulate its plan of action and work program from
Tuesday to Wednesday in Jakarta, according to a press release published
by ASEAN Foundation here Monday.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas will deliver the keynote address
and open the two-day workshop.
"The workshop aims to gather information, discuss issues and problems
in ASEAN member countries in order to generate ideas, inputs and views
and additional proposed actions and suggestions for project activities
to serve as a basis in the formulation of the ASEAN Foundation's plan
of action and work program," the press release said.
The ASEAN governments together with the governments of China and Japan
provided initial funding of the ASEAN Foundation. Contributions from
other ASEAN Dialogue Partners and from the private sector, particularly
big businesses in the region, will hopefully comprise a significant
portion of funds in the foundation, the press release said.
According to diplomatic notes signed here in April by Chairman of the
Board of Trustees of the ASEAN Ridzwan Dzafir and Chinese Ambassador
Chen Shiqiu, China will donate 200,000 U.S. dollars to ASEAN
Foundation.
The ASEAN Foundation, which was established on December 15, 1997 at the
Second ASEAN Informal Summit in Kuala Lumpur, was an initiative of
ASEAN leaders and retains a relationship of close cooperation with the
ASEAN Standing Committee, the ASEAN Secretariat and other ASEAN bodies.
The aim of the foundation is to assist ASEAN in its mission of
fostering a life of peace and prosperity for all the people of ASEAN by
contributing to ASEAN's development strategy of close regional
cooperation.
