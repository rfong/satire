Ukraine launches bid to join 
Ukraine decided Thursday to formally launch a bid to join NATO, a
senior government official told Interfax.
Defense Council Secretary Yevhen Marchuk said a formal request to join
the defense alliance will be presented to NATO Secretary General George
Robertson when he visits the former Soviet republic on July 9.
He said the decision was reached during a defense council meeting
chaired by President Leonid Kuchma.
"The council agreed that a long-term strategy must be worked out that
would enable Ukraine to join the collective security system upon which
NATO is based," Marchuk said.
