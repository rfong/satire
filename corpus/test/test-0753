New York sheriff labors in obscurity
Like all counties in the United States, New York has its own sheriff,
complete with his own star-shaped badge, but the job of Lindsay Eason
and his colleagues is a far cry from the fabled showdowns between
sheriffs and bandits in the Wild West.
In a city with some 40,000 police officers, the white and orange cars
of the New York City Sheriff's department pass by virtually unnoticed,
and many New Yorkers readily admit they have no idea the agency even
existed.
"I've been in the NYPD for 15 years, and I knew nothing of the
sheriff's office before coming here," admits Oscar Odom, Eason's chief
deputy.
The office of Sheriff of New York is considered the oldest operating
law enforcement office in the country, according to "chief" Peter
Talamo.
It descends from Jan Lampo, named sheriff in 1626, when the city was
still the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam.
On May 17, 1792, the first member of the American police force killed
in action was Isaac Smith, a city sheriff's deputy.
Until the creation in 1845 of the New York Police Department, the tasks
of maintenance of law and order and application of court decisions fell
on the sheriffs of the five counties which then constituted the city.
"When the NYPD was established, they pretty much pre-empted the
sheriff's work in criminal law enforcement," said Jeffrey Grossel, the
department's lawyer.
The sheriff and his 150 men now are responsible for recovery of debts
and execution of the civil decisions of the courts, such as seizures
and alimony collections.
Eason, unlike most US sheriffs, was appointed instead of elected. The
police veteran previously worked as chief of security for Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's media company.
"We're the chief civil law enforcement agency for the City of New
York," said Eason, 49, noting that the agency's biggest program is to
tow vehicles parked in unauthorized spaces or parked next to expired
parking meters.
Deputies comb the city in teams of two searching for cars with fines of
more than 230 dollars for towing. If the fine is not paid, the car is
put up for auction.
Eason said the department also is called to action when parents are in
arrears for child support.
In those cases, he said, "we first serve a summons, but sometimes we
get arrest warrants from the courts."
The sheriff's department controlled the city jails until the 1960s,
when the police department took over.
Deputies wear their yellow stars on each shoulder of their blue
uniforms, but save their blue Stetson hats for ceremonies. Their bureau
is just a few hundred meters from Ground Zero.
"In case of an emergency, we're on the line like any cop," said Odom.
"We were very instrumental in assisting during and after 9/11. Everyone
was there," he said, adding: "We're lucky enough to be the only agency
that didn't lose anybody. Not a single member."
