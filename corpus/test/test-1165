2 Priests Sentenced to Death on Genocide Charges 
The court in Rwanda's Western Kibuye Prefecture handling genocide cases
Thursday sentenced to death two Roman Catholic priests, radio Rwanda
reported Friday night.
The two priests, father Jean Francois Kayiranga and father Edoaurd
Nkurikiye were found guilty of genocide crimes they committed at
Nyundo, 20 km east of Gisenyi town during the 1994 genocide.
They were also found guilty of slaughtering about 2,000 people in
Nyange parish. The two priests who had been involved in the killing of
over 60 Tutsis at Nyundo ordered the destruction of a church housing
refugees.
The driver of the caterpillar machine, Anastase Nkinamubanzi, who was
paid to destroy the church was sentenced to life imprisonment.
A Congolese national, Andrew Labo Kasongo, who was heading the road
construction works on behalf of the Italian company Astaldi was
acquitted.
This is the first condemnation of church leaders who were involved in
the genocide since the beginning of Rwanda's trials in late 1996.
