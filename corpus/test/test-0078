Afghans may seek end of US bombing, conflict looms in region
Afghanistan indicated Friday it could soon ask the United States to end
its bombing campaign as fears mounted of more conflict in the region --
this time between archrivals India and Pakistan.
The last pockets of al-Qaeda resistance will likely be crushed "in
three or four days," Afghan defense ministry spokesman Mohammad Habeel
said, after which the new interim government will see whether the
US-led campaign, now in its 12th week, is still necessary.
But he added: "The Americans should not stop their bombardment until we
have advised ... them to do so."
In Islamabad, a military spokesman warned that India's military buildup
on the Pakistani border was nearing a point of no return.
Indian troop deployments have attained a "certain momentum,"
demonstrating "a desire in the Indian government to attain a capability
of offensive action," said the spokesman, Major General Rashid Qureshi.
"It seems that the Indian government is putting itself into a corner
where I think it would be difficult for them now to back off," he told
a press conference.
Asked if the threat of war between the nuclear rivals was now greater,
Qureshi said: "Any deployment in excess of what is required on the
border ... will be seen as a threat by the other country."
"You have seen a progressive increase in the level of forces and the
types of forces," he said, including surface-to-surface missiles.
Qureshi said Pakistan had deployed only enough force to ensure its
defense and "continues to exercise maximum restraint."
"But the government will ensure that Pakistan retains the capability of
reciprocal action, depending on what the Indian armed forces or
government do," he said.
The crisis stemming from the December 13 attack on the parliament in
New Delhi deepened Thursday after India announced a ban on Pakistani
planes using its airspace and a 50 percent cut in embassy staff in both
countries.
Pakistan swiftly reciprocated with identical measures but was likely to
be the harder hit economically.
Pakistan International Airlines said Friday it was temporarily
suspending flights to Singapore and Bangkok, as a result of the
airspace ban, and rerouting Hong Kong-bound flights through China.
India said it was prepared to allow Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf
to use Indian airspace when he flies to Kathmandu for the January 4-6
summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
But the gesture apeared double-edged, as analysts said Delhi could use
the the forum to further tighten the diplomatic screws on Islamabad.
The next step for India would likely be to internationalize its
accusations against Pakistan as a sponsor of terrorism, said S.K.
Singh, a former Indian foreign secretary and high commissioner to
Islamabad.
"We can pursue the SAARC forum. We can use the United Nations forum. We
have to talk to the European Union, the G-8, the Russians ... There are
hundreds of things that have to be done," he said.
The troubling rise in tensions triggered concern from the international
community, with the United States informing both countries that their
standoff could detract Washington from its prime concern: the war on
terrorism.
"We have ... made the interests we have in this subject known to both
sides very carefully and with clarity," US Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld said.
He also said he was concerned the build-up of troops may force Pakistan
to redeploy its forces away from the border with Afghanistan -- and the
hunt for bin Laden.
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer called his Pakistani and Indian
counterparts to urge a peaceful settlement of the crisis, while the G-8
-- the seven leading industrial countries plus Russia -- expressed
"serious concern".
The Organisation of the Islamic Conference urged the two countries to
show restraint, warning of "human, economic and social tragedies of
colossal dimension."
But Indian Home Minister L.K. Advani made it clear Friday that India
would pursue its objectives with or without international approval.
"Let the world support us," Advani said. "If they do not support us,
then that is all right too. There is no need to worry."
India has accused Pakistani intelligence of backing the parliament
attack that left 14 dead, and demanded that Islamabad shut down two
Pakistan-based Kashmiri militant groups it says are responsible.
Pakistan was the last country to continue to recognize Afghanistan's
now-defeated Taliban regime, which offered safe haven to Osama bin
Laden and his al-Qaeda organization, even after the September 11
attacks.
In the latest videotaped message by bin Laden, aired Thursday by
Qatar's Al-Jazeera television, the Saudi-born militant cited Kashmir,
disputed by India and Pakistan, as among places where "continuous
injustice (is) being inflicted on our sons."
The White House derided the tape as "terrorist propaganda," while
Rumsfeld acknowledged that Washington has no idea where bin Laden is,
or even whether he is dead or alive.
Fears of bin Laden's global reach mounted with the arrest last week of
a Briton who allegedly tried to blow up a US airliner with explosives
packed in his shoes.
US media said Richard Reid, 28, who was overpowered by passengers and
crew on an American Airlines Paris-Miami flight, had been trained in
bin Laden's Afghan camps.
Reid, who claims to have acted alone, faces a hearing in Boston later
Friday.
The worldwide hunt for bin Laden followers continued, with Philippine
officials announcing the arrest of a Jordanian believed to be an
al-Qaeda militant.
Hadji Yousef Alghoul, 35, arrested Thursday after three months of
surveillance, had bomb making material in his flat, as well as a
"Taliban poem" declaring war against the US, police said.
In Turkey, an official said the assets of a man identified only as a
"foreign national" were frozen as part of a probe into sponsors of
terrorism.
Turkish media identified him as Saudi businessman Yasin El Kadi, an
alleged bin Laden supporter.
After Rumsfeld's announcement Thursday that prisoners of the Afghan war
would be held at the US military base at Guantanamo, Cuba, Pentagon
lawyers have laid down the ground rules for the military trial of
non-US terror suspects, US newspapers reported Friday.
Their draft foresees unanimous verdicts for death sentences and the
right of appeal, with suspects presumed innocent until proven guilty
beyond reasonable doubt, The New York Times and Washington Post said.
The defendants could either have a military lawyer named to their
defense or hire a civilian lawyer; they would be allowed to see the
evidence against them, cross-examine prosecution witnesses and present
their own witnesses, the newspapers said.
But in a possibly controversial decision, the courts would allow
hearsay and other evidence excluded from civilian trials, the papers
said, adding that the military courts would probably meet outside the
United States -- possibly at Guantanamo.
Rumsfeld, describing Guantanamo as the "least worst" choice, said
Thursday there were no plans to hold military trials there.
Near London, military leaders from countries involved in the
International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan were holding a
third meeting to decide the composition of the force.
The Ministry of Defense would not say which countries were represented
at the meeting to discuss the "nuts and bolts" of the force, a source
said, for which "there are too many volunteers."
