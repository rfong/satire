US Responds Cautiously to Yeltsin's Pledge on Nukes 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen today responded cautiously to
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's offer not to aim nuclear weapons at
the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
At a signing ceremony for the Founding Act between NATO and Russia in
Paris Tuesday, Yeltsin told 16 NATO leaders that Russia will remove all
the nuclear warheads of the weapons which are aimed at NATO countries.
"It remains unclear to me, based on the reports that I've seen, exactly
what President Yeltsin had in mind," Cohen told a press conference at
the U.S. Strategic Command Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska.
"It may be simply a reaffirmation of the policy that was announced
previously that Russia would no longer target American either cities or
facilities," Cohen added.
"I think we have to be very cautious here. I think it's important that
we establish as good as a relationship as possible with our Russian
counterparts," he stressed.
After Yeltsin made the pledge, U.S. President Bill Clinton reportedly
favored some type of reciprocal gesture.
But Cohen said the U.S. will not take any immediate action. "I don't
think we should see any immediate reaction or take precipitous action."
"I would urge caution here, that we not make grand gestures before we
know what the facts are," Cohen stressed.
