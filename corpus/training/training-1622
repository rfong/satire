Egyptian FM to Attend U.N. Millennium Summit in Place of Mubarak 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will lead his country's delegation
to the United Nations millennium summit in New York, Egypt's official
Middle East News Agency reported on Friday.
Moussa, who will be in place of President Hosni Mubarak, will fly to
New York on Tuesday for the summit, due to be held on September 6-8,
the news agency quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry official as saying.
The Egyptian foreign minister will deliver a speech to the summit,
which will focus on Egypt's vision of the 21st century and the role
that the U.N. can play in the new era, the official said.
Due to busy schedules at home, the Egyptian president has canceled a
plan to take part in the millennium summit along with leaders of more
than 100 countries, reports have said.
Moussa is also expected to address the U.N. General Assembly on
September 13.
