SKorean reactor only choice for NKorea
The sole reactor on offer to North Korea, under the five-month-old
agreement to eliminate Pyongyang's nuclear threat, will be a standard South
Korean model, Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said Monday.
The nuclear Hobson's choice has been spelled out in a draft accord to
set up the consortium that will supply the reactor, the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO), Kono told the upper
house budget committee.
North Korea has baulked at accepting a South Korean type. Moscow,
Pyongyang's former Cold War ally, has meanwhile offered its own model.
Kono said the draft accord stipulated that KEDO's goal wass to provide
North Korea with two light-water nuclear reactors of the standard South
Korean type, with a capacity of about one million kilowatts, as well as
transitional energy supplies.
The agreement has been drawn up by KEDO's three core members -- the
United States, South Korea and Japan -- and is expected to be approved
by the cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama on Tuesday, Japanese
officials said.
They said the accord would be formally signed by the three countries in
New York on Thursday with some 20 countries expected to take part in
talks on ways to help finance the project.
In a deal with the United States to calm a nuclear standoff, North
Korea agreed in October to freeze its nuclear program, suspected of
developing atomic bombs, in exchange for light-water nuclear reactors
supplied by an international consortium.
The light-water types will substitute North Korea's graphite-moderated
reactors, which are abundant producers of weapons-grade plutonium.
But the draft accord on the consortium reaffirms that KEDO will take
"appropriate" steps if North Korea fails to observe arrangements under
the nuclear deal, the officials said.
