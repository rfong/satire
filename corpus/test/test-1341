Church Leader Lies in Makeshift Grave After Violent Funeral
The day after his funeral erupted into a riot, the leader of the
Ukrainian Orthodox Church lay in a makeshift sidewalk grave Wednesday
as church and government leaders debated his final resting place.
Authorities said 51 people were hospitalized after police used
truncheons on about 1,000 mourners who tried to break through a police
cordon near the funeral service for Patriarch Vololdymyr on Tuesday.
The patriarch's followers demand that he be buried at St. Sofia's
Cathedral, the city's holiest Orthodox shrine. But the government
rejected the church's request, and the patriarch was taken to be buried
at a nearby cemetery.
But later Tuesday, a group of determined followers, including
nationalist lawmakers and priests, used metal rods to smash the asphalt
on the sidewalk outside St. Sofia's and create a makeshift grave. They
then moved the coffin into the new burial place.
About 200 riot police used tear gas and nightsticks in two separate
attempts to restrain the protesting mourners. Some followers hurled the
cover of the opened coffin at policemen blocking their path, while
others threw chunks of broken concrete or hit them with nationalist
flags.
Many followers said the police action stemmed from opposition to the
independent Orthodox Church, which split from the Moscow-based Orthodox
Church in 1993.
Thirty-four police officers and 17 mourners were hospitalized after the
clashes, police said Wednesday. They said 33 mourners were detained
overnight. Eight members of the ultra right-wing Ukrainian National
Assembly were arrested.
The Ukrainian Interior Ministry and the government prosecutor's office
launched criminal investigations into the incident.
Meanwhile, a government commission were negotiating with the Holy Synod
of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church on Wednesday to decide where to put
the body.
Until a decision is made, the coffin will remain in its half-covered
grave in front of the cathedral, surrounded by barricades and police
and decorated with bouquets of flowers.
Deputy Prime Minister Roman Shpek said the new grave ``contradicted
both Ukrainian and international norms.''
Shpek also said the church leaders approached the government only at
the last minute with their request for burial at St. Sofia's, the
historical burial ground of all Ukrainian Orthodox patriarchs.
But Metropolitan Filaret, second-in-command of the Ukrainian Orthodox
Church, said they had informed the government and had been flatly
refused.
``I was told that if we didn't agree (with the government), we would
have a big problem on our hands,'' he told The Associated Press on
Wednesday.
``The current leadership has always ignored us,'' he said. ``We
understand what the goal is here _ to ruin the Kiev-led church and put
us all under the control of Moscow.''
