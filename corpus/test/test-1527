Germany's Greens Open Congress With Attack on EU
The German Greens Party opened a three-day congress Friday evening with
the promise of some lively debates to come about party structure and
policy reforms.
Co-leader Gunda Roestel started the ball rolling by launching an attack
on the European Union (EU). The EU should not be concentrating
exclusively on economic issues, she said.
That was "no longer enough. Europe must take more seriously its
political responsibilities as one of the largest, most powerful and
richest regions on this earth," she said.
She described the war in Kosovo as an "abysmal example of political
impotence" which showed that Europe was still a long way removed from
common policies. She also called for a strengthening of the European
Parliament and of citizens rights.
Although the green's party is in coalition with the Social Democrats
(SPD) in the federal government, its popularity has been falling and it
has descended into a renewed factional struggle between the pragmatic
"realos" and the fundamentalist "fundis" in a battle which was thought
to have been a thing of the past.
Part of the fundamentalist wing oppose the security policies of the
government and are thus by definition also opposed to German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer, a co-leader of the Greens.
The issue of security is scheduled to be debated Saturday.
The party's share of the vote has been falling consistently, with the
party's electoral backbone, young people, apparently turning away from
it.
In the election in the state of Hesse in February, the party polled 7.2
percent, down from 11.2 percent in 1995.
Some members of the "realo" wing believe that the party needs to
concentrate more strongly on education and jobs rather than the
environment and on vague exhortations such as "fighting U.S.
imperialism."
The congress is due to discuss the European Parliament elections in
June and decide on candidates.
