SADC Countries Urged to Enhance Trade 
A Zambian export firm has urged member states of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to encourage fair competition between
domestic products and imports from member states.
Bravetes International, the Zambian Export Company based in Namibia,
has implored SADC countries to enhance trade relationship in the
textile industry to attract regional investment.
The local press today quoted the company's Managing Director, Owen
Kasonso, as saying, ''there is need to enhance inter trade between SADC
member states especially in the textile industry to attract major
investment.''
Kasonso said in Ndola in Copper Belt Province on monday that SADC
member states should not close markets to imports from within the
region but instead put in a systematic information delivery mechanism
to improve trade relations.
He chellanged some SADC member states to open their doors and reduce
duty rates to encourage fair competition between domestic products and
imports from member states, and put measures in place to counter unfair
competition from heavily subsidized imports from outside the region to
sustain operations of the local industries.
However, Kasonso expressed the regret that the current situation is not
very conducive for fair trade as some SADC members are still protective
and cannot allow goods from within the region. enditem =09101227
