Gontchar Wins Fifth Stage in Tour of Switzerland 
Sergei Gontchar of Ukraine sprinted ahead in a photo finish to win the
fifth stage of the Tour of Switzerland in Piez on Saturday.
Gontchar denied German Jan Ullrich his second consecutive stage win by
taking the individual time trial.
Both clocked the same time of 39 minutes 30 seconds around the 31.5-km
circuit with Gontchar winning by 27 hundredths of a second.
Oscar Camenzind of Switzerland, winner of Tuesday's prologue, clocked
the third best time with 19 seconds behind.
Frenchman Christophe Agnolutto managed only 23rd place but held on to
his overall lead by 4:01, ahead of second-placer Valentino Fois of
Italy.
Ullrich, runner-up in last year's Tour de France, was third a further
2:23 behind.
