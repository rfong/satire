S. African Workers Calls for World Summit Against Terrorism 
The Workers Party of South Africa on Sunday called on world leaders to
convene a world summit Against war and terrorism.
The continuing deaths and destruction of property do not bode well for
the future of all nations, the party's leader Thulani Hlatshwayo said
in a statement in Johannesburg.
Hlatshwayo's comments came in the wake of the recent terror attacks on
the United States on September 11.
Hlatshwayo said his party viewed the "unfolding events with
consternation and dismay".
"In that context, we urge all world leaders, organizations, civil
leaders, military leaders and society to... arrange an urgent world
conference against war and terrorism within seven months," he said.
