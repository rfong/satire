Vietnam Has 10 Percent Elderly Population 
The number of the elderly in Vietnam has increased from 4.6 million or
7.2 percent of the country's population in 1989 to 7.8 million in 1998,
which is 10 percent of the population in some provinces.
The figures were announced at a two-day conference held here Tuesday
and Wednesday to discuss issues concerning the elderly and make
recommendations for policies concerning these people, Vietnam News
Agency reported.
The social and economic consequences of an aging population were the
focus of the first-ever national conference organized by the National
Assembly Committee for Social Affairs.
Participants were informed that by next year, the world's elderly
people will increase to 416 million or around 7 percent of the global
population.
By 2050, there will be 1.4 billion elderly people in the world, or 15
percent of the total population.
The Vietnamese government provides free health care and a very modest
pension for 25-30 percent of the elderly people, but over 70 percent of
them live in rural areas and have to depend on their children or work
to earn a living, said a Vietnamese official.
Eighteen reports were presented at the conference on the elderly people
in Vietnam, Vietnam's policies and laws for the elderly, health care
for the elderly, activities of the Association of the Elderly and
experiences of member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations in making policies for the elderly.
The conference aimed to help Vietnamese law makers build a more
appropriate system of laws and policies for the elderly in Vietnam.
