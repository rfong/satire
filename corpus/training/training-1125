Chinese, Indian FMs Pledge to Strengthen Cooperation 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his Indian counterpart I. K.
Gujral today agreed that the two countries should strengthen
cooperation in maintaining peace and stability in the region.
During his meeting with Gujral here, Qian said though there has been
changes of governments in India in recent years, the Sino-Indian
relations have developed steadily as the bilateral cooperation in
various fields has expanded.
The bilateral trade between the two countries in 1995 recorded 1.1
billion US dollars and is expected to increase this year, said Qian,
who is also Chinese Vice Premier.
On the border negotiations between the two countries, Qian said there
has been progress in this connection. He hoped that the 9th round of
talks on the border issues between the two sides to be held in Beijing
this year would bring about more positive results.
Gujral said both countries should make greater efforts and take actions
for making greater progress in negotiations on the border issues.
He also said the present Indian government will continue to observe a
policy of developing friendly relations with China.
The two ministers are attending the Third ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
and meetings between ASEAN and its Dialogue Partners. China and India
just became ASEAN's Dialogue Partners last week.
