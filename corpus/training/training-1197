Two Offenders Receive Prison Terms for Train Derailment Attempts 
Dou Zhenyang, was sentenced to life imprisonment Sunday, by the
Intermediate People's Court of Fushun City in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, for sabotaging communications devices and other
crimes, and Wang Hongjun was sentenced 13 years imprisonment for the
same crimes.
Court investigations indicated that the two offenders made a telephone
call to the Mayor's Hot line of Fushun City, asking for immediate
release of detained Falun Gong practitioners who attended illegal
gatherings.
They claimed that if those people were not released, they would "derail
passenger trains between Fushun and Beijing."
After their threats failed, the two offenders placed two specially made
roadblocks on the railway on the night of January 19.
The driver of a passenger train from Jilin to Tianjin saw the
roadblocks and urgently applied the brakes. The train slowed down and
collided with the roadblocks. Some parts of the train were damaged and
railway traffic was suspended for 12 minutes.
Four days later, the two offenders placed roadblocks on the railway
again and this time, a train was damaged in parts and the normal
operation of the railway was stopped for one hour.
The two criminals were also involved in printing and spreading Falun
Gong leaflets.
