CPPCC Leader Meets with Slovak National Council Chairman 
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), met here today with Ivan Gashparovic,
chairman of the Slovak National Council.
Relations between China and Slovakia have developed rapidly though the
two countries forged diplomatic ties only a short time ago, and they
share many common or similar views on major international issues, Li
said.
During the meeting, he expressed his appreciation for the Slovak
government's adherence to the "one-China" policy.
The CPPCC National Committee and the Slovak National Council enjoy a
very sound relationship, Li said, adding that he believes Gashparovic's
visit to China will deepen mutual understanding and friendship, and
expand bilateral exchanges and cooperation.
Li said the Chinese government very much appreciates the Slovak
government's adherence to the "one-China" policy and the position that
Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory.
The Chinese people will never forget that the Slovak government has
always taken a clear stand in supporting China on some major issues
concerning state sovereignty and national dignity, Li said.
When briefing the guest on China's domestic situation, Li said that,
while marked achievements have been made during the process of moving
to a socialist market economy, China still faces some difficulties,
which the government is facing squarely instead of dodging them, and
the government is exploring positive ways of overcoming these
difficulties.
Gashparovic said China was one of the first countries that recognized
and established diplomatic ties with Slovakia, which shows that
relations between the two countries have a traditionally good base.
Slovakia is a small country, and China a big one, but they can still
help each other, he said, and Slovakia will continue to support China
in international organizations.
Gashparovic said that he hopes that exchanges and cooperation between
the two countries will grow stronger.
