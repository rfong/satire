India Poised to Win Cricket Test Against The West Indies 
India on Monday was set to win the first cricket test against the West
Indies whose top batsmen failed in both the innings.
Chasing a victory target of 343 runs on a slow turning wicket, the
Caribbeans were 252 for eight wickets, after being five down for 82
runs at one stage.
A 162-run sixth partnership between J. C. Adams and J.R. Murray saw a
spectacular fight back by the visitors.
A worried Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin shuffled his bowlers and
succeeded in breaking the partnership 20 minutes before the close of
play on the fourth day.
The West Indies had a fighting chance to wrest the test from India's
grip as long as Murray and Adams were on the crease. But they got out
in quick succession after scoring 85 and 81 runs respectively.
The West Indies slumped to 252 for the loss of eight wickets and an
Indian victory now looks a certainty when the play resumes on Tuesday.
India's pace bowler Manoj Prabhakar struck a major blow when he removed
opener P.V. Simmons and Brian Lara in the very first over. Both were
out without scoring.
At lunch, the West Indies were 48 for the loss of three wickets.
The Indian tail wagged merrily in the morning as it added 46 runs to
the overnight total of 287 for eight wicket. India's opening bowler J.
Srinath scored the first half century of his test career.
