Dollar gets over the 101-yen mark 
The dollar climbed up over the 101-yen mark Tuesday afternoon on the
London foreign exchange market, encouraged by an earlier rise on Asian
markets and by technical factors, dealers said in late afternoon.
The dollar was trading at 101.05 yen against 99.75 Monday evening,
after having spent hours at around 100.95 yen preparing for the final
push up over the 101-yen barrier.
The greenback was not so dynamic against the mark, trading at 1.4725
marks in late afternoon after a session's peak of 2.576 and 1.4710
marks Monday evening.
Forex dealers said the dollar was primarily influence on Tuesday by
technical factors, some of them saying one of them was the Swiss
franc's level against the mark and the yen in the wake of a statement
by Swiss National Bank chief Markus Lusser.
The greenback was also helped by comments by chief White House
economist Laura Tyson, who said there were no "significant" signs of US
inflationary pressure.
Paul Hammett, an expert at Paribas Capital Markets, said the latest
dollar rise was not due to central bank intervention. But many
operators had expected concerted intervention in the dollar's behalf.
James Capel analyst Robert Prior had said earlier that once the dollar
gets up through the level of 101 yen, it might quickly move much
higher.
The peseta suffered against the mark, falling as far as 85.6 to the
mark after the Catalan nationalists expressed no confidence in the
Gonzalez government, now in the minority in parliament.
The French franc slipped against the mark to 3.4573 to the mark,
weakened by the announcement of higher taxes on some financial
investments in connection with the new French budget.
At 1600 GMT, the dollar was trading at 1.4725 marks (against 1.4710
Monday evening), 101.05 yen (99.75), 1.2040 Swiss francs (1.2065), and
5.0912 French francs (5.0763).
Sterling stood at 1.5530 dollars (1.5485), 2.2868 marks (2.2778),
156.93 yen (unchanged), 1.8698 Swiss francs (1.8683), and 7.9067 French
francs (7.8606).
Gold rose to 383.10 dollars an ounce against 382.10 on Monday.
The three-month interdollar was off to 5.75 percent against 5.8125,
while the British three-month interbank rate was unchanged at 6.6875
percent.
