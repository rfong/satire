Contact group begins meeting on Bosnia crisis
The five-country "contact group" on Bosnia huddled in a crisis meeting
Monday to discuss its next step in the republic as Serb forces
humiliate the United Nations by holding nearly 400 peacekeepers
hostage.
None of the principals at the meeting had any comment going in, but
David Owen, the mediator for the European Community, told reporters
that the "situation is very grim."
"We need to get back into a framework of negociations," he said.
The meeting was expected to last two hours and to be followed by a
press conference.
Before the meeting began, US officials said Washington hoped to
convince its partners in the group to boost UN might on the ground in
Bosnia while continuing talks with Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic.
Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity, Russia said Foreign Minister
Andrei Kozyrev would announce during the meeting that Moscow was
opposed to a UN pullout from Bosnia.
And the European Union meanwhile demanded the immediate release of the
UN hostages in Bosnia and said peacekeeping troops must be reinforced
so that they could stay long enough to achieve a diplomatic
breakthrough that would lead to peace.
"Things cannot stay as they are. Things have to change substantially
very quickly," French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said in
Brussels after EU foreign ministers held their own crisis talks on the
deteriorating situation in Bosnia.
The contact group is composed of Britain, France, Germany, Russia and
the United States.
A senior US official said the United States sees the "need for UNPROFOR
to be beefed up, to make it more capable of performing its mission and
to take measures to reduce the risk of hostage taking."
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, made the remarks
aboard a plane bringing US Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the
talks.
The session was being held on the sidelines of a meeting of NATO
foreign ministers in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, to decide the
alliance's next move in response to the crisis caused by 374 UN
peacekeepers being held hostage by the Serbs in retaliation for NATO
airstrikes last week.
"We are thinking largely about offering equipment and possibly
logistical assistance," the official said.
The UN peacekeepers' rules of engagement should be applied more
strictly to strengthen their capacity for self-defence, he said, adding
that France had proposed "some very good ideas" along these lines to
its contact group partners.
"They may need better equipment, some reinforcement, some redeployment,
so that they are not spread thin and become sitting ducks for Serb
attacks."
On the diplomatic front, the US maintains that last week's talks in
Belgrade between US special envoy Robert Frasure and Milosevic on
Serbia's recognition of Bosnia-Hercegovina in exchange for a suspension
of economic sanctions against Belgrade yielded a package which was 80
to 85 percent complete.
But the main obstacle is Milosevic's insistence on a total lifting of
sanctions, a US official said.
Asked about Russia's position, the official said: "We haven't had much
serious discussion with the Russians in the last couple of days."
Another State Department official said the Russian stance was
unpredictable, but noted that Moscow agreed with Washington on the need
to reinforce UN troops.
