Islamic conference organiser refutes terrorism accusations 
The organiser of an Islamic conference due to be held here on September
8 attempted Thursday to minimise the significance of the event, which
has provoked accusations that Britain is hosting a conference for
terrorists.
"I don't understand what all the fuss is about over this conference. No
terrorists will be present," said Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed, leader of
the al-Muhajiroun party and organiser of the conference.
On Wednesday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak criticised Britain for
hosting an Islamic conference which he said would be attended by
militants wanted in Cairo in connection with a four-year-old
anti-government campaign.
Algeria has also condemned the conference. An Algerian foreign ministry
spokesman said the meeting "will be attended by the paymasters, the
ideologists, the financiers and the zealots of international
terrorism".
Bakri told AFP that he was "surprised by the reaction of the president
of a country like Egypt against a small conference being held in
London".
According to the British press, some 14,000 people are expected to
attend the gathering, the third of its kind to be held in Britain.
"That figure is exaggerated," said Bakri. "We have sold only 4,600
tickets so far and we expect 7,000 in total," he said.
He denied that a video message would be broadcast from Omar
Abdul-Rahman, the spiritual leader of the Egyptian Islamic militants,
who is serving a life term in the United States.
"We have only received a four-line letter from him that will be read to
those present," Bakri said.
