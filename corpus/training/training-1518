Meningitis claims 29 lives in Ivory Coast 
A cerebro-spinal meningitis epidemic has killed 29 people in Ivory
Coast, regional health director Rose Zouzouko declared on Thursday.
Nineteen people died in the northwestern Odienne region, three near
Touba, 140 kilometres (85 miles) south of Odienne, and seven at
Seguela, 115 kilometres (70 miles) to the east.
On Wednesday, Zouzouko had declared the epidemic "very worrying", with
hundreds of cases reported and many other people not seeking medical
attention through ignorance.
"The disease is getting out of control," she told AFP.
Her authority has sent 30,000 vaccine doses to the region.
Outbreaks of meningitis are common in Ivory Coast between November and
February, when the hot dusty wind known as the "harmattan" spreads the
bacterium that causes it. Last year, 23 people died in the north.
