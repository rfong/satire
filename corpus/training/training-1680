Shanghai To Promote Cooperative Economy 
Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, is making an effort to
develop a co-operative economy based on public ownership.
Vice-mayor Chen Liangyu, speaking at a recent meeting on economic
affairs, cited the Shanghai Huasheng Chemical Company as an example of
this. He pointed out that it started with three jars, nine workers and
2,000 yuan in 1982, but now has 1.5 billion yuan in annual sales and is
the country's largest paint producer, with a 4,000-fold increase in
profits and a 3,000-fold increase in annual sales.
The company's general manager Li Longming attributes this to the
co-operative system, in which the State takes no responsibility for the
enterprise, and the enterprise offers no lifetime guarantee for its
employees, and everything is done according to market practices.
The company has the right to decide its internal arrangements, to raise
money on its own, and to follow its own path in market competition.
The vice-mayor said that other businesses should learn from Huasheng in
improving the state sector and collective enterprises, and traditional
management systems.
