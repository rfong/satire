Iranians Jubilant Over 4-2 Victory over China 
Hundreds of shopkeepers who watched their TV screens at downtown rose
to scream and jump in the air as Iranian soccer team scored its last
goal in a 4-2 victory over China in a World Cup Asian zone qualifier in
the Chinese port city of Dalian today.
"We are very happy. This will surely pave the way for our team to
advance to the 1998 World Cup finals in France," said a textile shop
owner named Mostafa Dadkhah.
He told about 20 other shopkeepers to be his guest, and ordered ice
cream and soda to celebrate Iran's come-from-behind victory over China.
Iran, who played the away game in group a, trailed 1-0 in the first
half and conceded the second goal one minute after the break. But the
Iranians soared back devastatingly, blasting four goals in a row to
seal a brilliant victory.
Aside from celebration and the jubilant mood, most Iranians believed
that despite a passive first half, the Iranian team was able to turn
the tide in the second.
"In the first half we thought that our team was not in good form, but
by the end of the game, when we saw how tired the Chinese were, we
realized that our strategy was to make the Chinese tired first, so we
could create chances to beat them in the second half," a university
student Ja'far Baqeri said.
Another Iranian sport fan said that although before this game he did
not think high of the Iranian head coach Mohammad Mayelee Kohan, but
now he believes that the man can lead Iran to gain bigger victories.
Rahim Rezabeik, a construction engineer, said:"Mr. Kohan showed that he
was an excellent coach. He sent up Ali Modier-Rousta to the field at
the right time, and his decision of pulling out Khodadad Azizi in the
second half proved a wise move."
Most Iranians interviewed after the game said that the Chinese made
mistakes by just following Iran's star strikers such as Ali Dayee,
Azizi and Karim Baqeri, but forgetting other players.
