Discord as international arms watchdog holds first full meeting 
An international watchdog set up in July to monitor arms exports began
its first plenary session here behind closed doors, but talks were
proving difficult, diplomatic sources said.
The 33 countries which have joined the so-called Wassenaar Arrangement,
reportedly still disagree on the role of the organisation which was
launched after two years of tough negotiations.
Another difficult issue is the nomination of a secretary general, which
has been the subject of heated debate for more than six months.
This latest two-day meeting, attended by some 150 senior civil
servants, according to diplomatic sources, is not expected to resolve
the problem.
Other items on the agenda include the practical details of exchanging
information on arms exports and equipment with possible military as
well as civilian use, the schedule for future meetings, the 1997
budget, and Latvia's demand for membership.
The Wassenaar Arrangement, which groups the European Union, Japan,
Russia, the United States and 15 other industrialised countries, takes
its name from a suburb of The Hague, where a preliminary framework
agreement for the organisation was signed in December last year.
The body, which aims to prevent the shipment of arms to countries
deemed a threat to peace, is the successor to COCOM -- the
Co-Ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls -- a committee
of western countries which controlled the export of sensitive
technology to communist states during the Cold War.
