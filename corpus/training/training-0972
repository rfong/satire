Volkswagen Contributes to Beijing International Music Festival 
The opera "Nabucco," sponsored by the Volkswagen (VW) Sound Foundation,
attracted a sizable audience during the ongoing Beijing International
Music Festival.
The opera was to commemorate Verdi, the famous composer of the work,
who passed away 100 years ago.
This was the fourth time for the Volkswagen foundation to sponsor
Beijing's popular music festival.
"We hope to introduce the well-known musicians to Chinese people, in
order to cultivate more good taste for music," said Michael Wilkes,
senior manager of marketing and public relations with VW China
Investment Company Limited.
The VW Sound Foundation has arranged free piano lessons for adults and
students since its establishment in July this year.
