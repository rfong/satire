S. Korean Maritime Affairs, Fisheries Minister Sacked 
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung fired his maritime and fisheries
minister on Tuesday in a partial cabinet reshuffle, amid angry protests
against a fisheries agreement with Japan.
Kim Sun-kil had been under fire since the government signed an
agreement which South Korean fishermen claimed gave Japan several
fertile fishing grounds.
The accord, put into effect in January, restricts fishing in each
other's exclusive economic zones, but South Korean fishermen claim it
was unfairly negotiated and overtly disadvantageous to them.
Kim Sun-kil, 64, was replaced by Chung Sang-chun, a two-term lawmaker,
former mayor of Seoul and vice-president of the United Liberal
Democrats (ULD) since 1996.
The ministerial change was made shortly before representatives of
several fishermen's groups filed a petition with the Constitutional
Court in a bid to get the agreement revoked.
The Seoul government was forced to renegotiate the treaty with Japan
this month after certain South Korean fishing boats were found to have
been excluded from the original treaty.
In Tuesday's partial reshuffle, President Kim Dae-jung appointed Seo
Jung-uck, former president of SK Telecom and a career engineer to
replace his science and technology minister Kang Chang-hee.
Kang has resigned to concentrate on campaigning for a seat in next
year's National Assembly elections.
