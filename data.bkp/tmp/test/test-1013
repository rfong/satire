Japanese/JJ Politics/NNS In/IN Turmoil/NNP The/DT political/JJ earthquake/NN last/JJ year/NN that/WDT ended/VBD nearly/RB four/CD decades/NNS of/IN one-party/JJ rule/NN here/RB had/VBD settled/VBN in/IN recent/JJ months/NNS into/IN quiet/JJ maneuvering/NN over/IN who/WP would/MD control/VB the/DT slow/JJ reconstruction/NN of/IN Japan/NNP 's/POS political/JJ order/NN and/CC how/WRB much/JJ the/DT economy/NN would/MD be/VB opened/VBN ./.

But/CC the/DT apparent/JJ calm/NN has/VBZ suddenly/RB been/VBN broken/VBN ,/, with/IN the/DT conservative/JJ rebels/NNS who/WP brought/VBD down/RP the/DT old/JJ system/NN voting/NN to/TO dissolve/VB their/PRP$ new/JJ parties/NNS in/IN a/DT kind/NN of/IN parliamentary/JJ free-for-all/NN and/CC the/DT Socialists/NNPS ,/, led/VBN by/IN Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Tomiichi/NNP Murayama/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT verge/NN of/IN splitting/NN because/RB of/IN a/DT deep/JJ ideological/JJ rift/NN ./.

At/IN a/DT big/JJ rally/NN Saturday/NNP ,/, a/DT group/NN of/IN several/JJ dozen/NN Socialists/NNS ,/, led/VBN by/IN the/DT party/NN 's/POS secretary/NN general/NN ,/, Wataru/NNP Kubo/NNP ,/, openly/RB called/VBD for/IN the/DT dissolution/NN of/IN the/DT party/NN and/CC the/DT formation/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ centrist/JJ one/NN that/WDT would/MD include/VB more/JJR middle-of-the-road/JJ Socialists/NNS and/CC other/JJ liberals/NNS ./.

Across/IN town/NN ,/, Murayama/NNP ,/, who/WP represents/VBZ the/DT traditional/JJ left/JJ wing/NN ,/, rejected/VBD disbanding/VBG his/PRP$ party/NN ./.

But/CC it/PRP was/VBD clear/JJ that/IN his/PRP$ power/NN was/VBD ebbing/VBG and/CC that/IN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN since/IN his/PRP$ coalition/NN government/NN took/VBD office/NN in/IN June/NNP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD facing/VBG the/DT prospect/NN of/IN being/VBG unseated/JJ ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT turmoil/NN ,/, the/DT world/NN 's/POS second-largest/JJ economy/NN is/VBZ heading/VBG toward/IN deepening/VBG political/JJ turmoil/NN ./.

Adding/VBG to/TO the/DT sense/NN of/IN confusion/NN is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ introduced/VBN a/DT new/JJ election/NN system/NN that/WDT is/VBZ bound/VBN to/TO change/VB the/DT character/NN of/IN the/DT legislature/NN ./.

In/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS potent/JJ symbols/NNS of/IN the/DT reordering/NN ,/, the/DT Japan/NNP New/NNP Party/NNP of/IN former/JJ Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Morihiro/NNP Hosokawa/NNP ,/, whose/WP$ formation/NNS prefigured/VBD the/DT extraordinary/JJ realignment/NN of/IN Japanese/JJ politics/NNS ,/, has/VBZ voted/VBN to/TO disband/VB ./.

And/CC the/DT remaining/VBG conservative/NN and/CC centrist/JJ opposition/NN parties/NNS said/VBD they/PRP would/MD dissolve/VB by/IN early/JJ next/JJ month/NN ,/, bringing/VBG to/TO a/DT close/NN the/DT brief/JJ period/NN when/WRB this/DT group/NN of/IN renegades/NNS broke/VBD the/DT old/JJ political/JJ mold/NN ./.

In/IN June/NNP 1993/CD a/DT group/NN of/IN nearly/RB 50/CD members/NNS of/IN the/DT conservative/JJ Liberal/NNP Democratic/NNP Party/NNP defected/VBD and/CC formed/VBD several/JJ of/IN these/DT new/JJ parties/NNS ,/, ending/VBG 38/CD years/NNS of/IN one-party/JJ rule/NN by/IN the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS ./.

If/IN they/PRP did/VBD not/RB change/VB things/NNS permanently/RB ,/, they/PRP did/VBD create/VB the/DT opportunity/NN for/IN real/JJ change/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN since/IN the/DT early/JJ days/NNS of/IN the/DT cold/JJ war/NN ./.

``/`` What/WP we/PRP did/VBD had/VBD great/JJ significance/NN ,/, because/IN we/PRP proved/VBD there/EX can/MD be/VB a/DT change/NN of/IN government/NN in/IN Japan/NNP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Tsutomu/NNP Hata/NNP ,/, the/DT leader/NN of/IN the/DT Japan/NNP Renewal/NNP Party/NNP ,/, who/WP was/VBD Prime/NNP Minister/NNP for/IN a/DT turbulent/JJ period/NN last/JJ spring/NN ./.

The/DT opposition/NN groups/NNS said/VBD they/PRP would/MD form/VB a/DT loosely/RB knit/VBN party/NN ,/, to/TO be/VB called/VBN the/DT New/NNP Frontier/NNP Party/NNP ./.

They/PRP vowed/VBD to/TO unite/VB to/TO bring/VB down/RP the/DT governing/VBG coalition/NN ,/, consisting/VBG of/IN the/DT Socialists/NNPS and/CC the/DT Liberal/NNP Democratic/NNP Party/NNP ./.

But/CC a/DT number/NN of/IN leaders/NNS of/IN the/DT opposition/NN group/NN said/VBD it/PRP would/MD probably/RB disband/VB soon/RB ,/, perhaps/RB right/RB after/IN the/DT next/JJ election/NN ./.

``/`` In/IN a/DT way/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT transitional/JJ step/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Kazuo/NNP Aichi/NNP ,/, a/DT former/JJ defense/NN minister/NN and/CC a/DT leader/NN of/IN the/DT nascent/JJ party/NN ./.

``/`` This/DT group/NN has/VBZ not/RB exactly/RB agreed/VBN on/IN a/DT platform/NN ./.

``/`` Murayama/NNP ,/, who/WP led/VBD the/DT Socialists/NNPS in/IN abandoning/VBG their/PRP$ entire/JJ platform/NN of/IN leftist/JJ policies/NNS ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN struggling/VBG to/TO halt/VB a/DT movement/NN to/TO disband/VB and/CC recreate/VB the/DT party/NN as/IN a/DT centrist/JJ alternative/NN ./.

The/DT fear/NN is/VBZ that/IN such/PDT a/DT move/NN could/MD force/VB the/DT government/NN to/TO collapse/VB by/IN alienating/VBG the/DT party/NN 's/POS old/JJ left/NN wing/NN ./.

The/DT Socialist/JJ rebels/NNS have/VBP suggested/VBN that/IN they/PRP might/MD compromise/VB by/IN voting/VBG on/IN dissolution/NN soon/RB but/CC waiting/VBG until/IN mid-1995/NN to/TO disband/VB ./.

Ikuo/NNP Kabashima/NNP ,/, a/DT political/JJ scientist/NN at/IN Tsukuba/NNP University/NNP who/WP polls/VBD voters/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ attitudes/NNS ,/, said/VBD the/DT Japanese/NNPS had/VBD shown/VBN a/DT growing/VBG disillusionment/NN with/IN all/DT parties/NNS ./.
