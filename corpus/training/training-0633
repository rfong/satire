Exxon to give away a SUV with each fill up
Top Exxon executives announced today that they have come up with a plan
that will give a SUV with each fill up, a move that top brass says is
their way to give back to the American people.
Thomas Engleberg Director of Customer Incentives said "Americans are
obsessed with their large Suv's, this is a way to get customers who may
shy away from $5.00 a gallon for gas or remember when gas cost $1.09 a
gallon to get to know the new Exxon."
When asked if they would fill their tanks up most people said only if
they could choose the color of the SUV.
Economist predict that this move by Exxon will bring in somewhere in
the neighborhood of 10 billion dollars in revenue, and cost most
Americans their ability to go to Starbucks every morning.
