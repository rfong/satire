Berlusconi ally summonsed over Mafia links 
Former premier Silvio Berlusconi's closest ally, the conservative
deputy Marcello Dell'Utri, has been summonsed to answer questions over
alleged Mafia links, legal sources here said Friday.
He is due to appear before anti-Mafia judge Guido Lo Forte on Wednesday
to respond to allegations against him made by a number of Mafia
informers.
One of those was Calogero Ganci, who was close to jailed supreme Mafia
boss Toto Riina.
Dell'Utri told journalists in reaction to the summons that "those who
know me well know that my life has been consecrated entirely to work
and family."
The politician, a founding member of the Forza Italia party which
propelled Berlusconi to power for most of 1994.
He was suspected of Mafia links after a spate of arson attacks in 1991
on a chain of stores owned by Berlusconi's Fininvest empire suddenly
stopped. Mafia informer Maurizio Avola said Dell'Utri cut a deal with
Sicilian Mafia leaders, a charge Fininvest has denied.
Dell'Utri, who masterminded Berlusconi's entry into politics from
business in 1993, became a Forza Italia deputy himself in elections on
April 21. He is considered a key figure in Fininvest.
However, he already faces three sets of allegations centred on fraud,
false accounting, using funds from a Fininvest subsidiary to launch
Forza Italia and setting up a multi-million dollar slush fund.
