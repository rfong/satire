Settler remanded over killing of Palestinian 
A Jewish settler suspected of shooting dead a Palestinian was remanded
in custody for a further 10 days by a Jerusalem court on Tuesday.
Zeev Liebskind, 40, was arrested after newspapers published photographs
of him firing his M16 assault rifle in the direction of Palestinians
during a protest over land rights.
Israelis from the West Bank settlement of Beit El opened fire on August
13 after Palestinians demolished a building under construction and set
fire to flags and religious books on a disputed hill-top.
Police say the bullet extracted from Liebskind's rifle killed
23-year-old Khaeir Abdel Hafiz from the neighbouring village of Dura al
Qar.
Liebskind's lawyer Yair Golan said his client fired in the air and did
not aim at anyone will therefore plead not guilty. He has also accused
the Palestinians of carrying out a "pogrom," although not a single
Israeli was hurt.
Settlers took over the hill-top as part of a campaign against the
spread of PLO autonomy over the West Bank.
