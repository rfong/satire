Taihu Lake Threatened by Flood 
East China's Taihu Lake is under the threat of flood because of
prolonged downpours during the rainy-season.
The water level in the lake, in southern Jiangsu Province, has
surpassed the warning level, according to local officials.
The rain has been caused by cold and warm air currents above the middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, due to a sub-tropical
high-pressure belt moving north.
According to meteorological departments in Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou
-- three major cities around the lake, the rainfall has averaged about
70 mm since July 10. Since the beginning of the rainy season in early
June, the rainfall in southern Jiangsu has surpassed 400 mm, doubling
the amount in a normal year.
By yesterday morning, the average water level in the lake had reached
4.18 meters, nearing the danger level of 4.2 m. Sluices have been
opened to release a flow of 200 cubic meters a second.
Because there is no end in sight over the coming days to the rain,
officials say, the situation for the lake is increasingly severe.
The three cities have sent patrols to monitor the dams around the
clock.
