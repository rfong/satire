Sharp Profit Fall at Bank of Julius Baer in Switzerland 
The Julius Baer banking group in Zurich, Switzerland Friday announced a
significant fall in profit for the first six months of this year. Net
profit was 138 million Swiss Francs (81.32 million US dollars), a drop
of some 45 percent from the comparable period last year.
The group said the result was attributable mainly to a decline in
transaction-related earnings, as well as to a rise in operating
expenses. Assets under management at mid-year 2001 totaled 141 billion
Swiss Francs.
Net income from trading dropped by 42 percent in the first half of 2001
to 64 million Swiss Francs, compared with 110 million Swiss Francs in
the same period last year, the group said.
Results for foreign exchange trading were up 13 percent at 61 million
Swiss Francs, while securities trading activities posted a positive
result of 22 million Swiss Francs.
Operating costs at the bank were up by seven percent at 504 million
Swiss Francs.
The group said that in view of recent developments, it had taken
various steps to cut costs. These include a freeze on new recruitment
and a 12-month period during which staff expenditure and other
operating expenses would be cut back by 35 million Swiss Francs.
It added that savings of roughly 60 million Swiss Francs per year could
be expected. Together with other measures, the savings should reduce
operating expenses by at least 80 million Swiss Francs a year.
The Julius Baer Group is one of Switzerland's leading banking
institutions and manages substantial assets for private and
institutional clients all over the world.
The group's services consist mainly of asset management and investment
counseling, investment funds for private and institutional investors,
institutional brokerage and securities and foreign exchange trading.
