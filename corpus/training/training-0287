Explosions Rock Political Parties' Office Buildings 
Two explosions rocked office buildings of two major political parties
of the Philippines in Manila Saturday, the last day of the three-month
election campaign period, but no one was hurt.
Police said that a motorcycle-riding man lobbed a grenade which ripped
through the windows of an office building of Laban ng Makabayang Masang
Pilipino (LAMMP) (Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) in Makati, Metro
Manila, at 01:15.
LAMMP is the country's largest opposition party headed by Vice
President Joseph Estrada, a front runner in Monday's presidential
election.
The suspect immediately escaped, police said.
The second explosive planted by an unknown suspect went off at an
office building of the ruling Lakas-National Union of Christian
Democrats (Lakas-NUCD) in Pasig, Metro Manila, at 03:00, police said.
No body was hurt in the two incidents.
Since January, at least 33 people have been killed in election-related
violence in the country.
However, the campaign period for this election was relatively peaceful
compared with the previous ones. In the 1992 elections, more than 100
people were killed in election-related violence.
To prevent more violence in Monday's Election, the government has
deployed thousands of policemen and soldiers at hundreds of "hot
spots," or violence-prone areas, in the capital city of Manila and
other regions.
The voters Monday will elect a new president, as well as a new vice
president, 12 out of 24 senators, all 250 members of the House of
Representatives, and 79 provincial governors and 1,600 mayors.
Speaker Jose de Venecia, the ruling party's presidential candidate, is
considered as the main rival of Vice President Estrada in the race.
