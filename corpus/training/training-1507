Crew evacuated from blazing ship 
All 27 crew of a cargo ship that caught fire early Friday 20 miles (32
kilometres) off the Devon coast in southwest England, have been safely
evacuated, LLoyd's casualty reporting service said here.
The crew of the Cyprus-registered CSAV Tolten were on board two fishing
vessels which were taking them to nearby ports. All are reported to be
unhurt except for one who has a minor burn on one hand.
A Royal Navy rescue helicopter helped with the evacuation of the ship,
but the fire has not been brought under control.
