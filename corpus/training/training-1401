LG Develops New DVD Chip 
South Korean LG Electronics (LG) has developed a new chip for digital
versatile disc (DVD), the LG company announced Friday.
The new product, integrating digital signal processing and servo
control into one unit, is suitable for small and portable DVDs and can
help cut down electricity consumption by more than 50 percent from 1.2W
to 500mW.
It also adopts an electrical shock proof function, said the company.
LG will mass-produce the new chips in September, which will help reduce
production cost by 10 million U.S. dollars a year, the company said.
