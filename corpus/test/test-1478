Qantas axes India service, postpones new planes
Qantas is axing its service to India and postponing delivery of three new
Airbus jets as part of a major review of its operations, the Australian
flag carrier announced Wednesday.
The decision follows the reduction of flights to Rome, Johannesburg,
Bangkok, Manila and Buenos Aires in a streamlining of its international
network in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks in the
United States.
The withdrawal of the five weekly return flights from Sydney to the
Indian west coast port of Bombay allows the carrier to transfer some of
its Boeing 767 fleet from international to domestic operations.
The service, routed via Singapore, was launched five years ago.
Its cancellation meant the airline could postpone delivery of three
Airbus A330 aircraft scheduled for mid-2003, Qantas Airways Ltd. chief
financial officer Peter Gregg said in a statement.
"We continually scrutinise every route in the Qantas network to ensure
we are managing our operations efficiently," Gregg said.
"This process has been particularly important following the terrorist
attacks of 11 September 2001 and the consequent action in Afghanistan."
Gregg said the first four Airbus A330s would be delivered as planned
between November and early next year.
"Qantas has a comprehensive and flexible long-term fleet strategy and
is continuing to modernise its fleet," Gregg said.
The first of the airline's new generation Boeing 737-800 aircraft
entered commercial service last week and a total of 15 will join the
fleet this year.
Qantas also plans to introduce six Boeing 747-400ER aircraft, which
have a longer range than conventional 747 aircraft later this year
after retiring two Boeing 747-SP aircraft and four Boeing 747-200s.
