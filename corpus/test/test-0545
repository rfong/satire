vigilant against the Ebola epidemic, a senior official of the ministry
said here on Friday.

Disease Control Alex Opio said the government has appropriated enough
funds for the fight against the disease, adding public education and
social mobilization are still going on in the country,
From Tuesday to Friday, two more people died of Ebola, bringing the
