Khatami Calls for Averting US Military Strike 
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami Wednesday called on the
international community and regional countries to spare no efforts to
prevent the United States from launching military strike on Iraq.
"As chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), I
called on all Muslim nations and governments, and all international
bodies and freedom lovers of the world to spare no efforts to avoid a
big human calamity in Iraq and a serious threat to the regional
security," he told a crowd at a ceremony here to mark the 19th
anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Khatami said that any act of aggression against Iraq would aggravate
the sufferings and pains of the oppressed Iraqi people.
"We condemn any aggression against the oppressed Iraqi people while
urging Iraq to respect all international laws and resolutions and avoid
providing a pretext for aggression of foreign powers," he said.
With an increasingly possible U.S. military attack on Iraq, Iranian
leaders expressed great concern, particularly over the possible
impacts, such as an Iraqi disintegration, a change of power in Baghdad
and a permanent presence of foreign military forces in the region.
Khatami said the Persian Gulf has become a place for maneuvers of
foreign fleets, and urged all regional nations to join hands in order
to establish security in the region by themselves.
He stressed that Iran stands for justice and freedom not only for the
people of Iran but for people throughout the world. "Our message to the
world...is that we want peace for all, a true peace, a peace under
which all are respected and rights of all the oppressed are
recognized," he said.
He deplored war, fratricide and massacres in Muslim countries, in
Afghanistan, Algeria in particular, calling for joint efforts to solve
the problems.
On Tuesday evening, Khatami also urged the United States to drop its
planned military strike on Iraq and conform to call of the world
against military actions.
