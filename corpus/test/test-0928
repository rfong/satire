Belgian, Dutch police en route for Haiti 
Thirty Belgian and 15 Dutch military police assigned to the
multinational peace force in Haiti left Belgium Tuesday en route for
the United States and the Caribbean, officials said.
The two-nation detachement will undergo three days of special training
in Puerto Rico prior to being deployed in Haiti with around 450
colleagues from other countries in the US-led Operation Restore
Democracy to consolidate the return to power of President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide.
The Belgian police are due to spend four months in Haiti, and their
Dutch counterparts six months.
