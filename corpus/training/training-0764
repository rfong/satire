Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks Resume in Cairo 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators resumed talks Tuesday on the
formation of a Palestinian autonomy council.
Before the meeting, Yoel Singer, head of the Israeli delegation, told
reporters that a problem remained over the size of the council. The
Palestinians want it to have 100 members, while the Israelis view it
more as a cabinet with about 25 members.
He noted an agreement in principle had been reached on having
international observers oversee elections to the council -- a longtime
Palestinian demand -- but details were still to be worked out.
The present round of talks is scheduled to end Wednesday.
Negotiations on Palestinian elections have made little progress. But
PLO chief Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres have
agreed to a deadline of July as a way to push along the talks.
The most important issue -- the withdrawal of Israeli troops from West
Bank towns to make way for elections -- remains a major obstacle.
The withdrawal and elections were called for in the Israel-PLO pact
that established the Gaza Strip and Jericho in the West Bank as
Palestinian self-rule zones.
That agreement called for broadening the autonomy into other areas of
the West Bank, which would come under control of an elected Palestinian
council. The present Palestinian National Authority, headed by Arafat,
is an appointed body.
