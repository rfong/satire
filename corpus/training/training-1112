Drab Sarajevo markets fill with flowers on Women's Day
The usually drab markets of Sarajevo were filled with flowers Wednesday
-- both fresh and paper ones -- as men and children rushed to buy
bouquets on International Women's Day.
"I got small presents from my daughters -- flowers and rouge, but my
husband still hasn't given me anything," said Sadeta Pocic, a
40-year-old housewife.
"He'll probably buy some flowers and some awful perfume at the last
minute like he has always done for Women's Day," she added.
Nine-year-old Ivan Potocki was out with his mother, Mira, to buy
flowers at the Markale market, where 68 people were killed a year ago.
"I got a few things from my four kids -- eye-shadow, rouge and perfume
and I don't expect anything else from anybody," the 44-year-old
waitress said.
Her husband was killed by a shell in 1992.
"This is the day when we should be more considerate with women, show a
little bit of tenderness. They deserve it because they are the strength
that stands behind us," said Amer, a 24-year-old soldier.
"Business is going very well," said Dino Dizdar, a 53-year-old vendor.
"But it's not like before the war when I could sell 10,000 individual
flowers on this day," he added.
Prices were high for a city where the average wage is no more than five
German marks a month.
Carnations sold for two marks a piece, roses for four. Nail polish cost
five marks.
