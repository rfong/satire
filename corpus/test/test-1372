Contemplating NATO role, Finnish leader travels to US
Finnish President Tarja Halonen travels to the United States this week
for talks with President George W. Bush expected to center on the small
Nordic state's delicate links with NATO and other security issues,
officials said.
"The topics they will discuss are the situation in the Middle East,
Afghanistan and security matters including NATO," Halonen's
spokesperson Maria Romantschuk said.
Halonen arrives in Washington Sunday and was scheduled to hold talks
with Bush Tuesday. The Finnish leader was also to meet with other US
administration officials and members of Congress during her three-day
official visit starting Monday.
Her trip to the United States comes amid a growing debate in Finland on
whether the country, historically neutral and with deep but ambivalent
ties with nearby Russia, should join the US-led North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
Long thought unthinkable, Finnish membership in NATO is now a subject
of open political discussion fueled by the alliance's favorable stance
on admission for the Baltic states and by Finland's participation in
NATO-led operations in recent years.
Halonen, a former trade union lawyer and gay and pacifist activist, has
strong influence in Finnish public opinion but is "struggling" with the
NATO issue, explained Tomas Ries, senior researcher at Finland's
Defense College.
"It appears that in her heart she is skeptical of NATO, but her
intellect -- she is intelligent and pragmatic -- is debating with her
instincts, making her reconsider," Ries said.
In a recent poll, 74 percent of Finns said they were against NATO
membership, a figure consistent with similar surveys conducted over the
past decade.
But while the country's leading political parties are quietly staking
out their positions on the issue, there has been general agreement not
to bring it to the fore of public discourse until after elections next
year.
Attitudes "might change quickly" when and if the country's leading
political voices make NATO membership an election issue, Ries said.
On a visit to Moscow earlier this year, Finnish Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen promised Russian President Vladimir Putin that Finland would
remain neutral for at least two more years.
NATO's eastward expansion however could leave Finland regionally
isolated on security matters -- Sweden, too, is examining whether or
not to join the alliance -- and will also affect Finnish views on the
issue, according to Communications Minister Kimmo Sasi.
"My forecast is that if our foreign policy position at that time will
be that we have to equate ourselves with Albania and Armenia, it is
quite possible that the government will then draw the conclusion that
NATO membership is in the Finnish national interest," Sasi said
recently on a television program.
Defense Minister Jan-Erik Enestam agreed with that view.
"We should ask ourselves the question: would it be more preferable for
Finland to sit at the table where the real decisions are made or not?"
he asked.
