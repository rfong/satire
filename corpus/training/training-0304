Graf arrives in Tokyo
World number one Steffi Graf ignored reporters on arrival at Narita Airport
Saturday, following the sentencing of her father to over three years jail
for tax evasion.
On Friday , her father, Peter Graf, was sentenced in a Mannheim court
to three years nine months in prison, but the German star whisked
through the airport here, oblivious to questions hurled by the press.
Graf, 58, was charged with evading tax of over 19 million marks (about
12 million dollars) by failing to declare earnings of some 42 million
marks (26 million dollars) which was disguised through front companies.
Graf has already spent 15 months in custody awaiting trial.
Steffi Graf will spearhead a star-studded field of the 926,250-dollar
Toray Pan Pacific Open tennis tournament here, one of the biggest
events other than the Grand Slam series, vying for the title she won in
1986, 1990 and 1994.
The six-day competition also includes Swiss teenager Martina Hingis,
who was to play for her first Grand Slam title later Saturday in
Melbourne, and defending champion Iva Majoli of Croatia.
Graf had been recovering from injury and illness after her shock
fourth-round defeat to South African Amanda Coetzer a week ago in the
Australian Open in oppressive heat. It was her earliest exit since her
early years on the tour in 1983-1984.
She was advised to rest at her Melbourne appartment to recuperate from
an infected toe and a heat-related illness.
