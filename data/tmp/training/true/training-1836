Dini/NNP ,/, who/WP had/VBD been/VBN treasury/NN minister/NN in/IN the/DT outgoing/JJ government/NN ,/, avoided/VBD mentioning/VBG any/DT date/NN ,/, noting/VBG that/IN only/RB Scalfero/NNP has/VBZ the/DT constitutional/JJ authority/NN to/TO call/VB an/DT election/NN ./.

But/CC he/PRP said/VBD he/PRP would/MD hand/VB in/IN his/PRP$ mandate/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN his/PRP$ government/NN accomplished/VBN its/PRP$ objectives/NNS ,/, which/WDT he/PRP said/VBD could/MD be/VB a/DT matter/NN of/IN ``/`` a/DT few/JJ months/NNS ./. ''/''
