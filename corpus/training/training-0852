Indian PM writes to Bush, Putin, Blair on Pakistan tensions
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has written letters to the US,
Russian and British leaders on the current tensions with Pakistan, an
official said Friday.
Indian foreign ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said Vajpayee wrote
the letters to President George W. Bush, President Vladimir Putin and
Prime Minister Tony Blair earlier this week.
"They were on the current situation," she said.
Military tensions between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan have peaked
following a murderous assault on a bus and an Indian army camp in
Kashmir on May 14 by Muslim militants which left 35 people, mostly
women and children, dead.
Rao said the letters mailed to Bush, Blair and Putin stressed India's
demand that Pakistan must curb cross-border attacks against India.
"The central substance is the argument that we have exercised restraint
all these months and that Pakistan have to recognise that it cannot
indulge in cross-border terrorism on one side and claim to be part of a
global coalition against terror," she said.
The Indian prime minister's letter also argued that Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf must abide by his pledge to crack down on religious
extremism.
Officials, meanwhile, said US Secretary of State Colin Powell was
expected to telephone Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh for talks
on the situation.
