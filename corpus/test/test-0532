Dole leads pack in New Hampshire: survey 
Senate majority leader Robert Dole has added to his lead over the field
of Republicans in the New Hampshire primary election, according to a
poll published Wednesday.
The CNN-USA Today survey conducted by the Gallup organization found
Dole was favored by 32 percent of voters in New Hampshire surveyed
February 12, five percentage points higher than in a similar survey
taken two days earlier.
In second place in the poll was conservative commentator Pat Buchanan,
with 22 percent, one point higher than in the earlier survey.
Dole and Buchanan were the top two candidates in the Iowa caucuses held
last week.
Milliionaire publisher Steve Forbes remained in third place in the
survey, but his support was eroding: 18 percent said they supported
him, compared with 25 percent in the previous poll.
Forbes was in fourth place in Iowa with 10 percent of the vote.
Former Tennesee governor Lamar Alexander was pegged as the fourth place
finisher in New Hampshire with 12 percent of the vote. He received 18
percent in Iowa and was third.
The poll anticipated the withdrawal of Texas Senator Phil Gramm, who
announced his decision Wednesday to end his candidacy.
The New Hampshire primary wil be held February 20.
