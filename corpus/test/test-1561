Japan's Lima embassy received bomb threat during hostage crisis: report 
The Japanese embassy in Lima received a bomb threat in January,
apparently from a member of the Peruvian rebel group that was then
holding the Japanese ambassador's residence, a press report said
Monday.
In response to the telephone warning the embassy suspended visa-issuing
and imposed tight security, Jiji Press quoted informed sources in Lima
as saying. The visa service is still closed but is handling urgent
cases, the news agency said.
A Spanish-speaking man, who purported to be a member of the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), warned the embassy staff in the call:
"We will detonate explosives" and "We will plant a bomb."
The embassy informed the Peruvian authorities of the threat and said
there was a possibility the call was a hoax, Jiji quoted the sources as
saying.
Visa-issuing had only just resumed after it was suspended when the
rebels took over the ambassador's residence, taking 72 hostages.
The ambassador's residence, separated from the embassy compound, was
stormed by 14 MRTA rebels during a gala party on December 17.
A team of 140 crack Peruvian troops raided the compound and rescued all
but one of the hostages last Tuesday, ending the 127-day standoff.
