Turkey Calls for Dialogue with Greece on Aegean 
Visiting Turkish foreign minister Deniz Baykal today called for direct
negotiations with Greece to settle territorial disputes between the two
countries.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with British foreign secretary
Malcolm Rifkind, Baykal said Turkey now hoped "to start a new era, a
new phase in which we will be able to negotiate the difficulties we are
having".
In his remarks, Rifkind urged the two countries to look not at the
distrust and hostility that have scarred relations in the past but at
the opportunities in the eastern Mediterranean that cooperation and
friendship could open up.
"We have seen in many other international issues the huge progress that
has been made in the last few years as a result of dialogue... and
therefore we believe that with two responsible governments in Turkey
and Greece it is important that direct contact be made with each
other," he said.
Greek and Turkish warships headed last month towards a tiny islet in
the eastern Aegean, with both sides claiming the barren rocks as their
national territory.
They pulled out their ships and aircraft after the United States
intervened to head off a military clash between the two NATO allies.
Baykal is in London on the first leg of his tour of European capitals
to seek European Union neutrality on the issue.
