Indian Banks Employees to Stage Two-day Strike 
About 700,000 bank employees will begin a strike for two days from
today as talks over the reconstruction of wages between the unions and
the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) failed here Monday.
This will be their second strike within a month over the issue of wage
revision. Leaders of the four central unions said in a statement that
since the IBA had rejected their proposals they had no option but to go
on strike. The Unions of Bank Employees had proposed to call off the
strike if the IBA gave in writing that it would reconstruct the
workmen's pay scales so that they would get parity in wages with class
one officers.
The government said that the strike would be in violation of the
Industrial Disputes Act and the Settlement signed by the unions in
February this year. Chief Labor Commissioner (Central) Surendra Nath
said that those responsible for the strike would be prosecuted under
the Industrial Disputes Act, in the event the strike materializes.
The union leaders of bank employees in their statement charged the bank
management and the government for resorting to threats.
