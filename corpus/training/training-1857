Hungary Welcomes Macedonian Disarmament Accord 
Hungary on Tuesday welcomed the Macedonian disarmament accord signed by
Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski and the leaders of the four
largest Macedonian parties a day earlier, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Horvath Gabor.
Under the agreement, the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army (NLA)
would hand over their weapons to NATO troops after an amnesty granted
by the Macedonian government.
The agreement would pave the way for bringing an end to the six- month
crisis and the bloody conflict in the Balkan country with the help of
the international community.
As it has always been doing, Hungary is looking forward to a successful
Macedonian peace process and would like to help promote the
implementation of all measures designed to safeguard Macedonia 's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, Horvath Gabor said.
Hungary has signaled that it would participate in the NATO mission and
offer material support to help Macedonia heal the wound inflicted by
the humanitarian calamity, the spokesman said.
