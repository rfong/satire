Western Chinese Oil And Gas Exploration Accelerated 
Western China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is entering a peak oil
and gas production period, with annual crude output capacity of 15
million tons in the region's three basins.
According to Dai Mingzi, head of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration,
some 40 oil and gasfields have been discovered in the Tarim, Junggar,
and Turpan-Hami basins with proven reserves equal to 2 billion tons of
oil.
He said that of 23 key oilwells being drilled in the Tarim Basin, rich
oil-bearing layers have been found in 13, and a large oilfield with 45
million tons and a large gas field with 20 billion cubic meters of gas
have been discovered in the Caidong Desert and Hutubi County.
In addition, a rich oil-bearing structure with proven reserves of more
than 50 million tons was discovered in the Turpan-Hami Basin recently.
The Junggar Oilfield has started tapping its Xiaoguai Oilfield, which
has proven reserves of 59 million tons.
The official said that because of the sharp increase in the amount of
proven oil and gas reserves, total crude oil production capacity in the
Tarim, Junggar, and Turpan-Hami basins is expected to go up from 15
million tons to 17 million tons by the end of this year.
The three great basins are expected to have 1.5 billion tons of proven
oil reserves and annual crude output of 24 million tons by the year
2000.
