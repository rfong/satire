Iraq Oil Exports to Reach Authorized Level by November 
Iraq's oil exports totaled 4.56 billion U.S. dollars in the current
180-day phase ending November 21, the United Nations Office of the Iraq
Program reported Tuesday.
With current prices and the current rate of export, Iraq will be able
to export 7.17 billion dollars worth of oil in Phase VI beginning May
25, well above the 5.25 billion dollars authorized by U.N. resolution
1242 (1999).
The resolution also indicates the Security Council's intentions to
review that ceiling if the need arises.
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of
Kuwait. Security Council Resolution 1153 adopted in February 1998
allows Iraq to export oil worth 5.25 billion dollars, raising the
previous ceiling of 2 billion dollars.
In Phase IV and V, Iraq was unable to meet the export ceiling because
of insufficient oil equipment and contracts held by some members of the
U.N. sanction committee.
