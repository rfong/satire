Thai opposition seek to avoid a tearful scene at censure debate 
Thai opposition MPs will try not to cause too much distress to the
premier's daughter during an upcoming censure debate, for fear that the
lady MP might burst into tears, The Nation reported Friday.
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa faces a grilling from the opposition
later this month, during which his daughter Kanchana is also expected
to come under scrutiny for her part in a land deal involving the
Banharn family and the central bank.
"We are not afraid of counter-attacks by the government, but what will
we do if Kanchana breaks down on the Parliament floor?" Pinij
Jarusombat, secretary-general of the opposition Seritham party told The
Nation.
Elected in 1995 as an MP for Banharn's own Chart Thai party, Kanchana
recently admitted her disenchantment with politics, which she said was
bad for her father's health.
In a much-publicised scene last month, father Banharn dragged his
daughter by the arm away from the TV cameras as she poured her heart
out to journalists.
Opposition MPs have reportedly agreed to avoid targeting Kanchana
directly when they attempt to move a no-confidence motion against the
premier on September 18-19.
"A crying Kanchana can create the impression that she is being
harassed," Pinij said.
