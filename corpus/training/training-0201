African Countries Urged to Avoid Massacres 
The challenge facing the international community regarding peace in
Africa is to ensure that mass killings like what happened in Rwanda in
1994 will not recur in the continent, a senior official of the
Tanzanian ruling party has said.
Phillip Mangulla, General Secretary of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi
(CCM), said Friday that African countries should establish means which
will enable them to solve their conflicts through negotiations.
Speaking to Rwandese ambassador to Tanzania, Joy Mukanyange, he said
ethnical, political and religious problems should be solved peacefully
so as to avoid bloodshed.
During the talks, which were also attended by CCM Deputy Secretary
General Hassan Ngwilizi, Mukanyange invited Mangulla to attend the
solemn ceremony to commemorate the the 1994 massacre.
Mangulla, who accepted the invitation, said CCM will send
representatives to the ceremony, to be held next Tuesday in the Kibuye
Province of Rwanda.
Meanwhile, Rwandese living in Tanzania will also commemorate the
genocide on Sunday afternoon in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
During the Rwanda genocide in April of 1994, 500,000 Tutsis and
moderate Hutus were reportedly killed.
