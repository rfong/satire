Official Says No Proof on Marcos Gold Hoard in U.S. 
The Philippine government said Monday that it has yet to come up with
concrete proof on reports about the presence of gold allegedly stashed
away by the late President Ferdinand Marcos in the United States.
In an interview here Monday morning, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora
said reports on the alleged Marcos gold hoard in the United States have
been "coming out every two years or so for the last 12 years."
"We have been looking into that long ago, but we have not come up with
anything solid so far," he said.
Zamora was reacting to a claim over the weekend by a prominent
businessman that there is some 35 billion U.S. dollars worth of Marcos
gold in the U.S. treasury.
He said the U.S. Embassy has been checking the claim, but has so far
turned up nothing.
Zamora also said the government is still waiting for the Marcos family
to appoint a single representative from their side before the
government reopens talks on the recovery of their assets.
