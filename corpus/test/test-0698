Barbie enters the next frontier: National Air and Space Museum
First there was stewardess Barbie, now there is Barbie the astronaut.
Through the years, the famous fashion doll has been an airline pilot, a
fighter pilot and, finally, a space shuttle pilot.
Barbie will star in a new exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum
in Washington tracing the evolution of women's career opportunities in
aviation and space.
Fifteen Barbies and 19 other women dolls, together with their numerous
outfits and accessories, are to go on display June 9 at the world's
most-visited museum, a part of the prestigious Smithsonian Institution.
Barbie, the long-reigning glamour queen of US dolls, began her aviation
career in 1961, a time when many little American girls dreamed of
becoming an airline hostess.
Wearing a tight uniform in American Airlines midnight blue over her
notorious anatomically unrealistic curves, Barbie served aboard an
imaginary jetliner alongside her "fiance," Ken, dressed as the pilot.
In a later version, Barbie's maker Mattel Inc. put her in the uniform
of the once high-flying but now defunct Pan Am Airways.
The target audience of the National Air and Space Museum exhibit is
children, curator Mary Henderson told AFP.
"You can see reflected in the chronology of the costumes some of the
changing roles of women in aviation and space flight," she said.
"Through the '60s and '70s, the female dolls were always stewardesses
and Ken was the pilot or military officer," she said.
"One big exception" to Mattel's early marketing strategy was the first
Barbie astronaut, introduced in 1965 at "the height of the space race
enthusiasm for the moon launches," she said.
Eighteen years before Sally Ride became the first US woman in space,
there was Barbie, encased in a metallic gray spacesuit and sporting a
space helmet.
"There had been some thought in the early '60s about letting women
participate in the astronaut program, but by 1965, women were not even
being considered for the astronaut program" when astronaut Barbie
appeared, Henderson said.
The second astronaut Barbie appeared in the 1980s and looked out of
this world, a creature beamed down from the science-fiction world of
"Star Trek."
Her accessories were extraterrestrial companions outfitted with long
chrome legs and day-glo costumes.
For the 1990s, Barbie the astronaut is more down to Earth. She is
dressed like a crew member of space shuttles Endeavour or Discovery,
and carries a moon rock in a small bag.
Never content to sit around just looking pretty, or miss another
marketing opportunity, Barbie also has jumped into other careers once
thought to be strictly a man's job.
In the 1990s she donned the "Desert Storm" combat gear of the 101st
Airborne Division in the Gulf War, as well as the uniform of a field
doctor. And she sacrificed her abundant blond or brown tresses for a
cropped hairdo, in strict compliance with US army regulations.
"We try to have Barbie reflect whatever is interesting in the world,
and so you can see Barbie's careers changing even in her flight
careers, as societal changes happen," said Mattel marketing manager
Lisa McKendall.
In response to growing ethnic sensibilities and changing US
demographics, Barbie is now available as an African-American and
Hispanic.
"Barbie has become one of the icons of American culture," Henderson
said. "I hope that this display will delight children, particularly
young female visitors, and make them more aware of the many aviation
and space careers now available to women."
