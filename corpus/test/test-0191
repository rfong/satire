Some 100,000 protestors take to streets again in Belgrade 
Some 100,000 anti-government demonstrators took the the streets of
Belgrade Wednesday to protest the regime of President Slobodan
Milosevic, the day after almost 60 people were hurt in clashes between
rival marches.
Braving snow and freezing temperatures protestors gathered for the 37th
straight day of demonstrations against the cancellation of sweeping
opposition victories in November 17 local elections.
The polls handed the opposition Together coalition control of 15 of
Serbia's largest cities, including the capital Belgrade, but they were
overturned on appeal by Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party.
Demonstrators threw snowballs at the hated state television building,
tightly controlled by Milosevic and which continues to pump out
official propaganda hostile to the opposition.
The demonstration came a day after 58 people were injured, including
five seriously, in clashes between anti-government protestors and
Milosevic supporters.
An estimated 200,000 opposition sympathisers joined Tuesday's rally,
compared to around 80,000 for Milosevic, despite a nationwide
mobilisation by the former communist Socialists to bus in supporters to
Belgrade.
A source close to the ruling party who asked not to be named said the
poor turnout -- well below the 400,000 people organisers said they had
expected -- was a blow to the Milosevic regime.
