For California Politicians, Fire Is The Perfect Photo Op
The sudden appearance of the men in suits and women in pantyhose
outside the Highway 41 fire head quarters was a tipoff that some thing
unusual was about to hap pen.
So were the clean shirts quickly donned by top brass inside the
building.
In this milieu of weary, grimy men and women, the nattily attired
visitors looked as out of place as Martians. But their function soon
became clear.
They were a political entourage -- actually two blended entourages --
awaiting the arrival of their bosses: Senate candidate Michael
Huffington and gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown, who is
challenging Gov. Pete Wilson.
Twenty-four hours later, Wilson arrived. California's biggest fire had
become an irresistible magnet for state politicians in search of the
perfect photo op.
``This is very common in an election year,'' said Jim McFadden, fire
chief of the city and county of San Luis Obispo and a veteran of forest
fires around the state.
Tuesday, McFadden and other fire officials briefed Huffington and Brown
on efforts to contain the blaze while, outside, the candidate's cadres
worked the press. A Huffington aide handed out copies of a letter the
congressman had written to President Clinton telling how bad the fire
was.
Meanwhile, Huffington's wife, Arianna, visited fire victims. She had
arrived with a load of sparkling water to deliver to firefighters.
Wilson appeared Wednesday morning, his entourage more appropriately
clothed in jeans and baseball caps. He was whisked from a local airport
to a devastated region off U.S. 101 between San Luis Obispo and
Atascadero, where 25 homes had been destroyed.
Wilson's aides scurried to find grief-stricken homeowners whom the
governor could console while the cameras rolled. One, Polly Cooper,
declined her opportunity to be comforted by the state's chief
executive.
``I don't particularly like Gov. Wilson,'' said Cooper, a solar
architect.
Wilson held a press conference in front of a sad forest of charred
trees. His assistants made sure nobody stood near enough to the
governor to block the TV cameras' views of the devastation behind him.
Wilson glared at a reporter who asked him about the political value of
appearances at disaster areas.
``Political value?'' he said. ``Anybody who finds any value in this is
sick.''
Hosting politicians in fire zones is nothing new to McFadden. He had
met Wilson before, when the San Diego Republican was running for
governor and a massive fire was threatening Santa Barbara. Then-Gov.
George Deukmejian came to that fire, too.
``They show up,'' McFadden said. ``We just try to take care of them
when they do.''
John Foy, a public information officer at fire headquarters, said the
visits served to make politicians aware of what was needed, in terms of
funding, to protect Californians from fires.
``It helps us to explain our needs,'' Foy said.
