Key Events in the Russian Hostage Crisis With BC-Russia-Politics
Key events in the Russian hostage crisis:
Late May _ The last Chechen strongholds begin to fall to Russia forces.
The Russians bomb the village of Vedeno, hitting the ancestral home of
Shamil Basayev, the top Chechen field commander. His mother, two
children, a brother, a sister and six other relatives are killed.
June 14 _ Dozens of rebels under Basayev's command launch a surprise
attack on the city of Budyonnovsk in southern Russia. They set houses
and cars on fire, storm police headquarters, gun down civilians and
seize hundreds of hostages. About 100 people die in one of the worst
terrorist attacks in Russian history. The rebels demand an end to the
war in Chechnya.
June 15 _ Russian security forces ring Budyonnovsk as the terrorists
hole up in the city hospital with about 2,000 hostages. Sporadic
fighting continues. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin hastily returns
from vacation at the Black Sea resort of Sochi. A handful of ailing
hostages are released. Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev says he did not
order the attack. In Moscow, 16,000 extra troops and police officers
are deployed amid fears of more terrorist strikes.
June 16 _ Despite parliament's bitter protest, President Boris Yeltsin
flies to Canada for a Group of Seven summit. In Budyonnovsk, a mass
funeral for 36 victims takes place. The rebels reject an offer of safe
passage.
June 17 _ Russian troops backed by helicopter gunships and armored
vehicles storm the Budyonnovsk hospital. Some hostages are freed in a
hail of fire from rockets, machine guns, grenades, but scores more die.
Hostages waving white flags beg the Russians not to shoot. The Chechens
release some women and children during a brief lull. In Halifax, a
bellicose, gesticulating Yeltsin calls Chechnya the ``center of world
terrorism'' and says he authorized the storming of the hospital.
June 18 _ Chernomyrdin begins an extraordinary series of televised
hostage negotiations with Basayev. After Chernomyrdin agrees to peace
talks, a temporary cease-fire in Chechnya and safe passage home for the
gunmen, Basayev frees about 400 hostages.
June 19 _ Yeltsin returns from Canada into a firestorm of criticism
over his behavior and his government's handling of the crisis. The
Chechens free their remaining 1,500 hostages as more than 100
volunteers _ doctors, nurses, members of parliament, local officials _
take their place as voluntary captives. A convoy of seven buses and a
refrigerator truck carrying the Chechen dead leaves Budyonnovsk. Peace
talks in Chechnya continue; so does sporadic fighting in the
countryside.
June 20 _ More than 10,000 people line the road near the Chechen border
to greet the rebels as they head home. At dusk, after a 30-hour
journey, the gunmen release their 123 volunteer hostages and escape
into the mountains. In Grozny, an agreement on a three-day cease-fire
is reached.
Wednesday, June 21 _ Russian parliament approves a motion of
no-confidence in the Yeltsin government over its handling of the
hostage crisis. In Chechnya, peace talks continue.
