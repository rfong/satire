Forest Parks Become Xinjiang's New Tourist Attraction 
Forest parks have sprung up in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in recent years, providing recreation for both local
holidaymakers and travelers from afar.
Last year five forest resorts started operation in Xinjiang, bringing
the total number to 27 in this largest ethnic-minority autonomous
region in the country, according to local government officials in
charge of tourism.
These new parks are located in the suburbs of cities, with herdsmen
renting out their tents as hotels and restaurants.
In 1996, some 820,000 tourists visited the parks, 200,000 more than the
figure of the previous year. They predicted a yearly growth of 10
percent in future, according to the officials.
To govern the activities of tourists, local forestry authorities have
issued a series of regulationsso as to prevent the breakout of fires
and the accumulation of waste.
The completion of a 520 km highway running across the desert will
benefit the development of the forest parks as it links up many such
parks. Moreover, this desert-borne highway has itself become a tourist
attraction, according to the officials.
