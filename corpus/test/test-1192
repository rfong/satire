Hong Kong exports fall 11.3 percent in November 
Hong Kong's total exports in November fell 11.3 percent year-on-year to
120.2 billion dollars (15.43 billion US) as the fallout of the terror
attacks in the US continued to affect the territory, the Census and
Statistics Department said Thursday.
The value of re-exports dropped 10.3 percent to 108.7 billion dollars
while domestic exports plunged 20.4 percent to 11.5 billion dollars.
Imports were down 11.5 percent in November to 123.4 billion dollars
after a fall of 14.9 percent in October to leave a trade deficit of 3.2
billion dollars.
A government spokesman said the negative impact of the September 11
terrorist attacks in the United States had continued to adversely
impact Hong Kong's trade performance.
He added there was an across-the-board setback in exports to most major
markets, particularly the US and Europe, while exports to China and
other Asian markets had also continued to decline.
For the 11 months to November, total exports were down 5.4 percent
year-on-year, re-exports fell 4.1 percent and domestic exports fell
15.7 percent.
Over the same 11-month period, imports declined 4.6 percent.
