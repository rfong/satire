Australia leave it late against spirited Wales
CARDIFF, Dec 1  - Australia overcame a ferocious Welsh fightback
to give wing David Campese a triumphant send-off in his final
international as the Wallabies preserved their unbeaten tour record
with a 28-19 win here on Sunday.
A late penalty try sealed Australia's 11th win in succession on their
European tour and Campese bowed out after 101 games and a world record
try count of 64.
But Wales rocked the Wallabies with a 90-metre breakaway try from
centre Gareth Thomas and 14 points from Jonathan Davies on his
international comeback putting them ahead 19-18.
Australia, who scored two first half tries through Matt Burke and
Michael Brial, recovered to regain the lead with a penalty before
clinching victory in the final seconds with a penalty try.
