Asian Games Theme Song 
Following are the lyrics for the Asian Games theme song - Fly:
Fly... I'm flying flying high
Far...how far that I can fly
If we don't give up now, we can
reach the dream somehow
One day, will be our day
Fly...to where we want to be.
Fly...to let our soul go free
And the pride be surely ours
We'll reach the goal that found,
and become a star one day
Chorus
Asian Games, built up the will to fight
Give it all you have with pride
Full of hope and full of dreams...
Asian Games, we give it for the team
To make it through for all we know
Wish come true so fly away...
Make a better day tommorow.
Yesterday is gone away
Reach for the star, to the way
for all you are
And then, your heart's
going to shine
Smile and love will never end.
Even tears are falling down
All the joy that you have found,
and the games are ours now
All the stars are in your heart.
