Cuba to Have 4 Billion Dollars in Foreign Investment 
Cuba has received since its opening to foreign capital foreign
investment pledges for four billion dollars, part of which has entered
the country and the rest is in process, said Friday Cuban Foreign
Investment Minister Martha Lomas.
Lomas said during the meeting of U.S. businessmen with Cuban
authorities in the tourist city of Cancun, in the southeastern Mexican
state of Quintana Roo, that the investments arrived Cuba in difficult
times but now they are ripening.
She said that Cuba's economy is not going through a process of
privatization, but it is rather seeking a complement in important
sectors like tourism, oil, and communications, to continue its
development, despite strong United States pressures.
The minister highlighted the importance of Mexico as one of Cuba's main
partners, especially in relation to commerce activity, and mentioned as
an example the participation of a firm of Mexican capital that offers
cell telephony services.
The Cuban minister said that the United States is obsessed with
changing Cuba in a radical way, and that it is very possible that it
will get in the future other ideas, such as the emerging of a list in
which there are firms that allegedly make illegal business in the
island.
It would be also possible that it would think up another law, similar
to the Helms-Burton, or the Torricelli, to hamper the development of
the country, said Lomas.
She mentioned that the Sherryl International firm, related to the
nickel and oil industries, and the BN firm, were sanctioned by the
United States, but despite that, they continue in Cuba making
investments, which is respected and valued by Cuba.
The minister told all the businessmen attending the meeting and those
who will learn in the future about this meeting, that all of them are
welcomed in Cuba, and much more the big business entrepreneurs, who
support the country with their capitals and at the same time all
Cubans.
