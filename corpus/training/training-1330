State Council Passes Draft Law on National Defense Education 
The draft law for education on the national defense of the People's
Republic of China was passed Wednesday at the 34th executive meeting of
the State Council.
The State Council also passed a draft amendment on the regulations for
active service officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).
Education on national defense forms the basis of building and
consolidating the country's national defense, and is also important in
enhancing people's awareness of national defense and unity of the
Chinese nation, it was pointed out at the meeting.
The State Council was also noted that the regulations for PLA officers
on active service, which were first enforced in 1988, have played an
important role in improving the overall quality of officers and
ensuring that they carry out their duties in accordance with law.
However, certain parts of the regulations no longer suit the needs of
the current situation as the country is deepening the reform of its
political and economic systems and further developing its military
forces, said the State Council.
The State Council decided that the draft law and the draft amendment
will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress for deliberation.
Premier Zhu Rongji presided over the meeting.
