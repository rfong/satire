Heavy/JJ weapons/NNS were/VBD banned/VBN from/IN around/IN the/DT capital/NN last/JJ year/NN under/IN threat/NN of/IN NATO/NNP airstrikes/NNS ,/, but/CC raids/NNS on/IN the/DT U.N./NNP depots/NNS where/WRB they/PRP were/VBD stored/VBN have/VBP grown/VBN as/IN the/DT threat/NN of/IN NATO/NNP retaliation/NN has/VBZ faded/VBN ./.

The/DT Serbs/NNPS detained/VBD hundreds/NNS of/IN peacekeepers/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS has/VBZ been/VBN reluctant/JJ to/TO call/VB in/IN airstrikes/NNS since/IN then/RB ./.

But/CC Wednesday/NNP 's/POS ultimatum/NN apparently/RB reflected/VBD U.N./NNP frustration/NN over/IN signs/NNS that/IN the/DT two/CD sides/NNS were/VBD intent/JJ on/IN settling/VBG their/PRP$ differences/NNS on/IN the/DT battlefield/NN rather/RB than/IN seeking/VBG a/DT negotiated/VBN peace/NN ./.

Wednesday/NNP 's/POS explosion/NN of/IN fighting/VBG also/RB seemed/VBD linked/VBN to/TO the/DT failure/NN of/IN a/DT U.S./NNP effort/NN to/TO drive/VB a/DT new/JJ wedge/NN between/IN the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNPS and/CC their/PRP$ former/JJ mentor/NN ,/, Serbian/NNP President/NNP Slobodan/NNP Milosevic/NNP ./.
