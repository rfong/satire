UN envoy fails to reach ceasefire accord
UN special envoy to Afghanistan Norbert Holl failed to broker a
ceasefire agreement Wednesday and said "there is no guarantee of
success."
Holl met here for three hours with northern warlord Abdul Rashid Dostam
and Pakistani mediator Naseerullah Babar and said they held "tough and
very intensive discussions on the issue of a ceasefire."
But the talks failed, he said, and "for the time being, to be honest,
there is no guarantee of success."
