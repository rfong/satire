World Economy Growth to Pick Up Modestly in 1997 
The World economic growth is expected to pick up this year and continue
to strengthen over the next few years, a group of economists said
today.
More than 70 economists from all over the world were attending a
three-day meeting of the Ad Hoc Expert Group on the Short- and
Medium-term Prospects of the World Economy.
According to their forecast, the continuing expansion of the world
economy is led by the developing countries, where aggregate output is
seen as increasing by 6 per cent in 1997 and at a slightly faster pace
in 1998. All main developing country areas are forecast to share in
this expansion, with a particularly rapid rate of increase in Asia.
An acceleration in growth is also expected in the more industrialized
groups of developed market economies, although the average rate of
expansion in these countries is likely to remain slower than in the
1980s.
They said that this positive outlook for world economic growth is also
reflected in the sustained buoyancy of world trade. While world trade
slowed down in 1996 following two years of extremely high growth, world
trade volumes are now expected to rise rapidly during 1997 with the
recovery of continental Europe.
