Law On Drink Driving Comes Into Effect in Hong Kong
An ordinance to tackle drink driving offenses came into effect in Hong
Kong today.
Under the new law, drivers are guilty of an offense if they are tested
for having 80 mg alcohol in every 100 ml of blood when driving.
The so-called .08 level is set after the standard adopted in most
European Union countries and many U.S. states.
The law says that drivers are obligated to provide samples of blood,
urine or breath for testing in certain specified circumstances.
Drivers can be asked to provide a breath sample if they are involved in
an accident, having committed a moving offense or their behavior
provides reasonable grounds for suspicion that they are affected by
alcohol.
More than 80 traffic officers have been trained to use the drink-drive
screening devices and learn procedures for requesting a breath sample.
Figures available showed that alcohol was a factor in at least 8
percent of fatal driver accidents in the territory. There were no
statistics for non-fatal or non-injury accidents.
Police sources say that the new law would give Police a much clearer
picture of the extent of drink-driving in Hong Kong.
A drink driving offender would be fined 25,000 HK dollars (3,200 US
dollars) at most, plus three-year imprisonment and suspense from
driving for no less than two years.
