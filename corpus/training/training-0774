The funeral of Solomou was originally planned for Saturday in the presence
of Simitis, but was moved to a less volatile time on Friday evening before
the Greek premier's visit.
The UN representative in Cyprus, Gustave Feissel, held urgent meetings
with both Clerides and Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on Thursday
warning them that there could be no repetition of the violence.
In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said the Cyprus
question can only be resolved by simultaneous admission of the divided
island and Turkey in the European Union.
"A spontaneous and lasting settlement will be brought to the Cyprus
problem if Cyprus and Turkey are admitted to the EU at the same time,"
she said.
Ciller visited northern Cyprus on Thursday and reiterated that Turkey
would "not tolerate border violations."
The EU has already started a mechanism for Cyprus' EU membership with
the internationally recognised Greek-Cypriot government in Nicosia.
The Turkish Cypriots oppose the deal arguing that the Greek-Cypriot
government cannot decide on their behalf.
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey occupied the northern
third of the island following a right-wing coup in Nicosia inspired by
the junta then ruling in Greece.
The Turkish Cypriots created their own state in 1983, but this
breakaway country is recognised only by Ankara.
