China Raises Public Awareness About Disabled 
On the occasion of the sixth Help-the-Handicapped Day, nearly 10,000
people from all walks of life of the Chinese capital took to the
streets here today to raise people's concern about the disabled.
They publicized handicap prevention and China's undertakings for the
disabled by means of pictures, bulletins, slogans, broadcasts, books
and consultation.
He Luli, vice-chairperson of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, and Deng Pufang,
president of the China Association for the Handicapped, participated in
the activities today.
The national Help-the-Handicapped Day falls on the third Sunday of May.
The theme of this year's Help-the-Handicapped Day was "handicap
prevention and health improvement".
Similar activities have been held in places across the country over the
past few days.
