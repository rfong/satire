Crop-wrecking bacterium unmasked by DNA sleuths
A devastating bacterium that causes millions of dollars in crops losses
every year has been unmasked by genetic scientists.
Researchers led by Christian Boucher of France's National Institute for
Agronomic Research (INRA) will report on Thursday that they have
unravelled the genetic sequence of Ralstonia solanacearum.
The bug inflicts a disease called southern wilt, whose targets include
more than 200 species of plants, from potatoes, tomatoes, bananas,
tobacco to mulberry trees and flowers.
It lurks in the soil in warm and tropical climates, attacking the
leaves of the plant, turning them yellow, and then destroys the stem,
turning it brown and rotten.
There is no treatment for the disease, and temperate countries,
terrified that the bacterium can be imported in roots or leaves,
usually impose tough controls on imports from places where there has
been an outbreak.
Writing in the British science weekly Nature, the researchers say
Ralstonia is an unexpectedly large bacterium with two chromosomes that
control more than 5,000 proteins.
About a hundred of these are so-called "effector" proteins which
stealthily make their way into the plant's cells and then engineer
metabolic changes that enable the bacteria's toxins to spread like
wildfire through the host.
"A better understanding of the effector proteins and the impact they
have on their target is of prime importance for devising new weapons"
against southern wilt, Boucher told AFP by phone from his lab in
Toulouse.
One avenue of exploration would be to identify genetic characteristics
in some plant species that make them resistant to the bacteria.
Cross-breeding could transfer those genes to crops, making them
hardier.
The researchers note that one of southern wilt's victims is thale cress
(Arabidopsis thaliana), a small, much-studied weed that has already
been genetically sequenced in its entirety.
That should make it a lot easier to understand the mechanisms by which
the bacterium infiltrates plants and the ways in which it can be
fought.
