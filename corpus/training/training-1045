Technology Stressed In Increasing Cotton Output 
China should turn to technology to increase cotton output, said State
Councilor Chen Junsheng at a working meeting on cotton production,
which ended today.
Chen, also director of the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative,
noticed that the cotton planting areas should no longer be decreased,
and great efforts should be made to increase cotton production.
Noting that the price of cotton has been hiked over the past years, he
said, it was impossible to use pricing to give scope to the initiative
of farmers for planting more cotton.
"Technologies, especially key technologies in breeding, planting,
management, the control of cotton diseases, and elimination of pests,
can significantly increase the per-unit yield and thus should be the
very thing we should depend upon," he said.
The price of cotton will remain stable this year, and all cotton will
be purchased by the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Chen
said. The involvement of any units or individuals is not permitted.
