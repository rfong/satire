Bonner's Star Isn't Always Under A Bushel
The New York Knicks had just captured their 11th victory in the last 12
games, beating the Dallas Mavericks, 106-93. Reporters were gathered
around Pat Riley, Patrick Ewing, John Starks and Derek Harper.
Meanwhile, Anthony Bonner dressed quietly in front of his locker Friday
night, drawing little attention, but not the least bit bothered.
Bonner is often overlooked, but among his teammates and coaches his
work is appreciated. It is no coincidence that the Knicks are 9-1 since
Bonner returned to action after the death of his father last month. It
is no coincidence that the Knicks won 15 consecutive games last season
when Bonner was the starting small forward.
Every team needs players who play defense, who rebound, who hustle, and
who sacrifice personal recognition for the good of the team. Bonner
fulfills that role, and does it without complaint. He knows he will
never be a star in the National Basketball Association, but Bonner
doesn't care. He would rather be a winner. And since he arrived in New
York last season, Bonner has helped the Knicks win.
``There's nothing glamorous about it, but I have a certain job that I
have to do for this team,'' said Bonner as the Knicks (23-13) prepared
to end their three-game road trip Sunday night against the Miami Heat.
``That's the way it has always been for me from Day 1 since I started
playing basketball. When I came here, it was only natural to wonder
where my minutes were going to come from. But Coach Riley demands hard
work, and that's my game. I feel confident that if I do what I'm
capable of doing, there's going to be an opportunity for me to play.''
When the Knicks signed Bonner as a free agent from the Sacramento Kings
before last season, many people asked, ``Why?'' The Knicks were already
deep at forward with Charles Oakley, Charles Smith, Anthony Mason and
Tony Campbell. Where would Bonner fit in?
Yet from the first day of training camp, Bonner proved he was a Knick
-- tough, competitive and aggressive. Campbell was eventually traded to
Dallas, and Bonner became a mainstay in New York's rotation as a backup
at both small forward and power forward, helping the Knicks win 57
games and reach the National Basketball Association finals.
Last year's finals remain a painful subject for Bonner. Though he was
hampered by a badly pulled muscle in his abdomen, Bonner felt he could
have helped the Knicks beat the Houston Rockets. Instead, Riley relied
on a six-man rotation and Bonner played just 11 minutes during the
finals, watching from the bench as the Knicks lost in Game 7 to the
Rockets.
That was one reason why New York's 93-77 victory over Houston on
Thursday gave Bonner a special feeling. He played his best game of the
season, with 9 points, 8 rebounds, 2 steals and 2 assists.
And Bonner made the hustle play of the game in the third quarter, when
he beat Hakeem Olajuwon and Robert Horry to a loose ball. Bonner dived
head first onto the floor to knock the ball ahead to one of his
teammates, while Olajuwon and Horry banged heads, tripping over the
fallen Bonner. New York's bench erupted.
``I mean, that ball was on the floor and there were three men diving
for it, but Bonner came up with it,'' Riley said. ``That's what we have
to have. He was the real key, the biggest key.''
Bonner believes he would have made a difference in the finals last
season, too.
``The Houston game was special for me,'' Bonner said. ``It won't change
the fact that we lost the championship, but it made it special because
sitting over there last year, I knew I could've had an affect on a
Robert Horry, a Carl Herrera, or whoever.
``There are so many things that run through your mind. I was hurt and
it's hard to say how effective I would've been, because I wasn't given
the opportunity. But my mind wanted me to play. And if the mind is
willing, the body is usually able to. But not having that opportunity
will probably make me work that much harder this year to get back.''
Bonner has already overcome many obstacles this season. When the Knicks
drafted Monty Williams, the competition for playing time became even
more intense. In November, Bonner spent three weeks on the injured list
after arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. Then on Dec. 19, his
father, Isaac Bonner, died of a stroke.
But through it all, Bonner persevered. A career 58.5 percent free-throw
shooter, Bonner has improved this season to 74 percent from the line,
another example of his hard work. And his consistent play off the bench
has helped lessen the impact of injuries to Oakley (toe surgery) and
Herb Williams (fractured finger).
Bonner will be an unrestricted free agent after the season, and he
doesn't know whether he will return to the Knicks.
``None, not a clue,'' Bonner said. ``I don't even think about it. I
don't worry about what I can't control. I can only hope that the little
things I do on this team aren't overshadowed by the big numbers some
players put up. There has always got to be work in this league for
someone who brings the intangibles.
``I know what it takes to win. It's not like signing a rookie who
doesn't know how to sacrifice some of the glamour that players in this
league so desperately want. I don't care about that. I just want to
play and I want to win. If I do that, everything else will take care of
itself.''
REBOUNDS
-- Miami (12-25) has struggled this season, but the Heat beat the
Knicks at Madison Square Garden, 122-111, on Dec. 12. ANTHONY MASON
