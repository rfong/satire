French Businessman Defends Cash Gifts to Israeli President 
Cash gifts to Israeli President Ezer Weizman were merely an act of
friendship and beyond reproach, a lawyer for the French millionaire at
the heart of the financial scandal said Saturday.
Lawyer Pinhas Rubin said his client Edouard Seroussi had merely given
cash gifts to a "friend with money troubles."
"We are talking about friends that are very, very close and very
intimate," Rubin told the Israel Radio.
"He lent a shoulder in a totally natural, totally regular, totally
friendly way, on a totally personal basis and suddenly this personal
basis is the subject of rumors," Rubin said.
This was the first statement issued on behalf of Seroussi over the
money scandal which was exposed by an Israeli reporter two weeks ago.
Rubin did not mention how much money Seroussi gave to Weizman, but
local media put the figure at about 450,000 U.S. dollars.
As asked by Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein and State Attorney Edna
Arbel, an Israeli police team was formed to help examine the case.
The police is scheduled to start its investigation on Sunday under the
supervision of Arbel and police chief Yehuda Wilk.
Both Rubinstein and Arbel said Thursday that the police involvement is
part of their examination of the case, not a criminal investigation
against the president.
After going over the material evidence for several days, they said they
have reached the conclusion that the material requires additional
clarification, for which they do not have the tools.
On learning the decision, Weizman issued a statement saying he welcomes
the decision to hand over the investigation to the police.
In keeping with what Weizman has reiterated over the past few days, the
statement reiterated that Weizman has no intention of stepping down at
this juncture.
Israeli reporter Yoav Yitzhak broke the story at the end of 1999 that
Weizman received a total of 453,000 U.S. dollars from Seroussi and
Weizman used this money from 1988 to 1995 when he was member of the
Knesset (parliament), minister and president.
Weizman said he used the money for medical treatment of his son, Shaul,
who was badly wounded in the 1970 War of Attrition and died in a car
accident in 1991.
