Vicar sees red over giant pink condom 
A plan to promote safe sex by hoisting a 13-meter (42-feet) bright pink
condom over an obelisk in Potsdam has enraged the vicar at the nearby
church of Saint Nicholas.
"I think it's shameful," complained Dietmar Beuchel, who is attempting
to stop the unrolling of the jumbo-size contraceptive over the
historical monument on Sunday at the start of a week-long AIDS
awareness campaign in this eastern German city.
Beuchel, who is charged with discussing AIDS-related matters with the
young people in his parish, denied his protest stemmed from excessive
prudishness.
He said he was objecting to accompanying publicity by the initiative's
sponsors, the Italian clothing firm Benetton, which has previously used
shock advertising campaigns on social issues to promote its goods.
