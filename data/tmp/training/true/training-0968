Pressure/NN mounts/VBZ on/IN Mark/NNP Taylor/NNP by/IN John/NNP Yarwood/NNP For/IN a/DT man/NN with/IN the/DT guillotine/NN hovering/VBG perilously/RB over/IN his/PRP$ neck/NN as/IN he/PRP focuses/VBZ on/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP ,/, Mark/NNP Taylor/NNP remains/VBZ remarkably/RB relaxed/JJ ./.

The/DT Australian/JJ captain/NN was/VBD still/RB able/JJ to/TO smile/VB broadly/RB Tuesday/NNP as/IN he/PRP analyzed/VBD his/PRP$ nightmare/NN run/NN with/IN the/DT bat/NN in/IN the/DT Test/NNP series/NN against/IN the/DT West/NNP Indies/NNP ./.

The/DT series/NN ended/VBD here/RB Monday/NNP with/IN a/DT runaway/JJ 10-wicket/JJ win/NN for/IN Courtney/NNP Walsh/NNP 's/POS side/NN ,/, though/IN Australia/NNP won/VBD the/DT series/NN 3-2/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP am/VBP out/RB of/IN form/NN --/: there/EX is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN about/IN that/DT ,/, ''/'' he/PRP conceded/VBD ,/, with/IN characteristic/JJ candor/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP am/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO kid/VB myself/PRP to/TO say/VB I/PRP am/VBP hitting/VBG them/PRP well/RB and/CC I/PRP am/VBP just/RB getting/VBG out/RP ./.

That/DT would/MD be/VB foolhardy/JJ ./.

``/`` I/PRP have/VBP to/TO play/VB better/RBR ./.

Taylor/NNP faces/VBZ a/DT problem/NN approaching/VBG crisis/NN proportions/NNS ,/, compounded/VBN by/IN Australia/NNP 's/POS imminent/JJ departure/NN for/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP ,/, where/WRB the/DT tourists/NNS will/MD rely/VB heavily/RB on/IN solid/JJ starts/NNS by/IN their/PRP$ opening/VBG batsmen/NN --/: Taylor/NNP ,/, Matthew/NNP Hayden/NNP and/CC Matthew/NNP Elliott/NNP --/: against/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP 's/POS menacing/JJ pace/NN ./.

The/DT Australians/NNPS fly/VB to/TO South/NNP Africa/NNP later/RBR this/DT week/NN and/CC play/VB in/IN three/CD Tests/NNS which/WDT ,/, arguably/RB ,/, will/MD decide/VB the/DT unofficial/JJ world/NN Test/NN championship/NN ./.

The/DT left-handed/JJ Taylor/NNP had/VBD a/DT Test/NNP average/NN of/IN almost/RB 46/CD before/IN this/DT summer/NN ,/, yet/CC in/IN nine/CD innings/NNS in/IN the/DT five/CD Tests/NNS against/IN the/DT West/NNP Indies/NNP he/PRP has/VBZ struggled/VBN to/TO make/VB 153/CD runs/NNS at/IN a/DT meager/JJ average/NN of/IN 17/CD ./.

He/PRP has/VBZ only/RB one/CD half/NN century/NN to/TO his/PRP$ name/NN in/IN his/PRP$ past/JJ 25/CD first-class/JJ knocks/NNS ./.

His/PRP$ form/NN in/IN one-day/JJ internationals/NNS this/DT summer/NN was/VBD equally/RB poor/JJ ,/, with/IN eight/CD knocks/NNS yielding/VBG 143/JJ runs/NNS for/IN an/DT average/NN of/IN 17.87/CD ./.

During/IN a/DT period/NN in/IN which/WDT Australia/NNP 's/POS selectors/NNS have/VBP been/VBN notoriously/RB unsympathetic/JJ to/TO failure/NN ,/, 32-year-old/NNP Taylor/NNP --/: a/DT veteran/NN of/IN 77/CD Tests/NNS in/IN which/WDT he/PRP has/VBZ notched/VBD up/RP 14/CD centuries/NNS --/: has/VBZ survived/VBN because/RB of/IN his/PRP$ outstanding/JJ captaincy/JJ flair/NN ./.

The/DT Australian/JJ psyche/NN is/VBZ intolerant/NN of/IN consistently/RB non-producing/JJ captains/NNS ,/, however/RB special/JJ their/PRP$ strategic/JJ talents/NNS ,/, and/CC Taylor/NNP must/MD now/RB be/VB desperately/RB close/JJ to/TO the/DT brink/NN after/IN his/PRP$ recent/JJ loss/NN of/IN form/NN ./.

``/`` A/DT lot/NN of/IN it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT mind/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP can/MD overcome/VB that/DT by/IN getting/VBG other/JJ things/NNS moving/VBG ,/, ''/'' Taylor/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` If/IN you/PRP work/VBP on/IN the/DT physical/JJ side/NN ,/, the/DT mental/JJ side/NN comes/VBZ with/IN it/PRP ./. ''/''

Taylor/NNP said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD looking/VBG forward/RB to/TO arriving/VBG in/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP ,/, where/WRB he/PRP could/MD escape/VB from/IN the/DT extra/JJ pressures/NNS of/IN being/VBG a/DT captain/NN in/IN a/DT home/NN series/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP hope/VBP to/TO spend/VB the/DT first/JJ three/CD weeks/NNS of/IN the/DT tour/NN working/VBG on/IN just/RB Mark/NNP Taylor/NNP for/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, and/CC hopefully/RB I/PRP can/MD turn/VB it/PRP around/RB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ amazing/JJ how/WRB when/WRB you/PRP are/VBP out/RB of/IN form/NN ,/, you/PRP get/VB good/JJ balls/NNS ,/, you/PRP get/VBP run/VBN out/RP --/: these/DT things/NNS happen/VB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` And/CC when/WRB you/PRP are/VBP in/IN form/NN ,/, you/PRP play/VBP and/CC miss/VBP --/: blokes/NNS throw/VBP to/TO the/DT wrong/JJ end/NN when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO run/VB you/PRP out/RP ./. ''/''

Asked/VBN bluntly/RB how/WRB many/JJ more/RBR low/JJ scores/NNS he/PRP could/MD afford/VB before/IN he/PRP got/VBD the/DT axe/NN ,/, Taylor/NNP replied/VBD curtly/RB :/: ``/`` Ask/VB the/DT selectors/NNS ,/, mate/NN ./.

Taylor/NNP can/MD gain/VB little/JJ comfort/NN from/IN his/PRP$ last/JJ visit/NN to/TO South/NNP Africa/NNP three/CD years/NNS ago/RB when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD vice-captain/JJ to/TO Allan/NNP Border/NNP for/IN the/DT three-Test/JJ series/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD drawn/VBN 1-1/CD ./.
