Mormon church gets new leader 
The 84-year-old grandson of Mormon pioneers has succeeded the late
leader of the Church of Latter-day saints.
Gordon Hinckley was ordained Sunday as the 15th president of the
Mormons, whose numbers have been doubling every 15 years since the
1950s, taking over from Howard Hunter who died at 87 on March 3.
A lifelong member of the church, Hinckley was the senior apostle in the
succession of the all-male hierarchy of the Mormons who have some
50,000 full-time missionaries around the world.
Hinckley's grandfather was an associate of church founder Joseph Smith
and followed patriarch Brigham Young west to Utah in the middle of last
century.
