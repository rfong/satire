Indian MPs call for military strikes against guerillas: report 
Indian members of parliament have called for military strikes against
guerilla bases in Bhutan, Bangladesh and Burma, The Times of India
newspaper reported Saturday.
A panel of MPs from the home ministry told parliament it was worried
about reports of insurgency groups building bases along the Indian
border.
"A viable strategy, including diplomatic efforts, has to be devised to
strengthen the borders with these countries," the report said, adding
escape routes used by the guerrillas should be sealed.
"If these diplomatic efforts do not yield results, as a last resort the
doctrine of hot pursuit should be adopted."
The panel blamed Indian intelligence agencies for the continuing
infiltration of outlawed secessionist groups into India.
The inflitration was "continuing unabated and our security forces have
not been that successful in checking this influx," it said, describing
operations to track down cross-border rebels inside India as
"half-hearted".
The panel's demand for military intervention came as the home ministry
named four leading tribal separatist groups in India's remote far east
which it claims have set up bases in Bangladesh.
New Delhi also suspects groups in the far eastern states of Assam,
Tripura and Nagaland of launching attacks from Myanmar and Bhutan.
Thousands of Indian soldiers and civilians have died during the past
decade in the country's seven remote fareastern states bordering
Bhutan, Bangladesh, China and Burma.
