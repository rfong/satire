Copper prices down on profit taking after last week's highs 
Copper prices declined on Wednesday on profit taking after the high
levels in the previous week while backwardation (cash price premium)
was easing, dealers said.
Copper prices at three months fell by 19 dollars to close at 2,948
dollars per tonne while the cash prices fell by 30 dollars to 3,027
dollars per tonne.
However, the underlying tightness in the physical market remains. "No
one is sure whether the tightness is over and therefore there could be
another squeeze on the upside," analysts at GNI said.
Aluminium followed copper, weakening by four dollars to close at 1,771
dollars per tonne.
Zinc and lead prices were also dragged down. Dealers were awaiting
developments in the labour dispute at Canadian producer Cominco, where
talks were due to be resumed on Wednesday.
Zinc fell by eight dollars to 1,035 dollars per tonne while lead was
down two dollars to 634 dollars per tonne.
Nickel rose by 45 dollars to 8,290 dollars per tonne and tin rose by 30
dollars to 6,690 dollars per tonne on the back of high Japanese import
figures.
