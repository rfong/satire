Singapore November retail sales down 0.7 percent 
Singapore's retail sales suffered a year-on-year decline in November,
according to official figures released Sunday, reflecting stiff
competition in a tight consumer market.
November retail sales reached 2.02 billion Singapore dollars (1.44
billion US), the department of statistics said, adding that it marked a
0.7-percent year-on-year decline.
But the sales represented a modest 1.9-percent increase from the
previous month, the department said.
A month-on-month comparison showed most retailers performing better in
November than they did in October, with dealers of furniture and
household equipment, textiles and garments, and department stores and
supermarkets all reporting higher sales.
The only group reporting a month-on-month drop in turnover was motor
vehicle dealers, whose sales fell by 11.5 percent in November compared
to October.
A year-on-year breakup of the performance of each sector was not
available.
Singapore's troubled retail sector is facing pressure from rival
shopping capitals and a glut in retail space here while the strong
local currency makes shopping in the city-state an expensive
proposition for foreign tourists.
The sluggish retail market has claimed several casualties, notably
French department store Galeries Lafayette, Hong Kong retailer Lane
Crawford and American supermarket chain K-Mart which have all announced
a closure of their Singapore operations.
