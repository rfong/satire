Blonde Bombshell In Breaststroke Bugger-Up!
Pretty regional swimming champion Claudia Bartlett was so close to
reaching her ambitious target of swimming 20 kilometres, but had to
stop just fifty agonising metres from the end of the marathon record
attempt.
The tearful twenty-two year-old blonde beauty had to be helped out of
the olympic-sized Pond's Forge swimming pool in Sheffield, when
exhaustion forced her to abort her record charity attempt.
One of the adjudicators, Sid Bingle told us: "It was heartbreaking to
see her suffer in this way. But the rules clearly said that 400 lengths
of the pool had to be completed. Unfortunately for Claudia, she only
managed 399.
"Claudia is a lovely girl, and I'd dearly love to slip her a length,
but it's more than my job's worth, you must understand."
