The head of international routes at SAS, Marie Ehrling, said: "SAS and
Lufthansa are going to test the market with a view possibly to
extending these code-sharing flights to other destinations in Europe
and elsewhere next winter."
The head of planning at Lufthansa, Walter Prenzler, said: "With these
code-sharing flights, Lufthansa and SAS have made a big step towards
our joint objective of offering clients the most-frequent,
most-complete services in Europe."
