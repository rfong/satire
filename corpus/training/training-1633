It is no longer possible for opposition fans to make jokes about the
ball spending more time in the air than on the ground at Arsenal where
some of the most attractive football this season has been played.
Champions Manchester United have a chance to arrest a disturbing slump
in form when they face Leicester who dumped their illustrious hosts out
of the League Cup on Wednesday.
The 2-0 defeat was United's sixth defeat in eight games but in their
defence it must be said that David May and Roy Keane were the only
first team players in a side made up of reserves and youth players.
United boss Alex Ferguson admits his first priority is next week's
decisive Champions' League match at Rapid Vienna, but he is still
expected to field a full-strength side on Saturday.
Liverpool, 4-2 destroyers of Arsenal in the League Cup on Wednesday,
must wait until Monday to renew their title challenge.
They travel to London to face a demoralised Tottenham side, buoyed by
the fulsome praise of Arsenal boss Wenger.
"Liverpool are the best side we have played since I joined Arsenal,"
said Wenger.
Tottenham, by contrast, are reeling from a 6-1 League Cup humiliation
at the hands of first divsion Bolton Wanderers on Wednesday.
"It was the worst performance since I became manager here, without any
doubt," said Spurs boss Gerry Francis. "We were humiliated. We were
outfought, outbattled and out-thought."
