Texans Hope Paul Can Restore State's Reputation After Bush Fiasco
It was once a state whose residents considered themselves Texans first
and Americans second. It was big oil, big money, big hats and most of
all big Texas pride.
It was the state that made itself famous with a motto that basically
said, "Don't mess with us."
But times have changed for the Lone Star State. Dairy farms full of
cattle have been replaced by cubicle farms full of telecom geeks. The
meatloaf and mashed potatoes at the local diner has been replaced by
low-carb special at Ruby Tuesday's. And the state whose most popular
icon was once Tom Landry, the brilliant head coach of "America's Team",
is now synonymous with George W. Bush, the bumbling lunatic in charge
of America's Corrupt Empire.
"People used to say 'I'm from Texas' with pride, like people from New
York City do now." said high school wrestling coach, C.J. Hartmann. "It
didn't matter if you were from Lubbock or Waco or Galveston. It was
like 'Hey, I'm from Texas. Where the hell are you from?!?"
A State's Image Severely Tarnished
Times have dramatically changed, according to many like Hartmann.
"Now, no one wants to be associated with the word 'Texas.'" said
Hartmann. "We had a good thing goin' and Bush stunk it all up."
Computer programmer Mike Horvath, who grew up in Texas, agrees.
"It's like a scarlet letter. My best friend, Rodney, never tells people
he's from Texas." said Horvath. "He'll say something like, 'Well, I was
born in Little Rock and then my family moved to Highland Park.' I think
he's hoping people will think it's the Highland Park outside of
Chicago."
Apparently, that was just the start of Rodney's deception. The other
day, Horvath caught Rodney wearing an "LSU Football" sweatshirt.
"I'm like 'Dude, they're not even in the Big Twelve ... and you went to
TCU for godsakes!'" said Horvath. "It sucks, people think we all make
chimpanzee faces and walk around saying stupid crap like 'I'm the
decider!' all day."
Even Texas A&M, the highly-regarded university in College Station, TX,
finds itself in a tough spot trying to recruit out-of-state students.
Admissions counselor Megan McGrath said the university tried to go with
a marketing campaign in which they dropped the "Texas" and just tried
to push the "A&M" moniker, but she said that turned out to be just as
problematic.
"People started wondering if we were from Florida A&M, and we were
right back to being associated with those Bush idiots." said McIntosh.
Local Congressman Brings Hope
Now, the state is pinning its hopes and its reputation on their
Republican presidential hopeful, ten-term congressman from the 14th
District, Dr. Ron Paul.
"It's like he's everything George Bush isn't." said Houston-based
entrepreneur Bill Dobson. "He's honest. He's intellegent. He actually
served in the military and understands the consequences of our foreign
policy. He's a hard-working American who studies the Constitution and
hasn't been handed anything on a silver plate."
While a lot of Texans are becoming optimistic as Paul's polling numbers
have more than tripled and the national media is starting to take
notice of Paul's meteoric rise, many fear that the connection to their
home state is eventually going to doom Paul's campaign.
"I'm afraid that they are just setting us up for the inevitable
disappointment." said Betty Masterson, a native of Corpus Christi. "The
local media is portraying him as the new messiah, but I know once those
Madison Avenue types get a hold of him, they'll bury him, dragging our
state's name through the mud in the process."
Many in Washington think Masterson could be right. Democrats know that
the Texas association is going to be a tough sell for many voters who
have suffered through eight years of the Bush Administration.
"Right now, he's still under the radar." said Democratic strategist
Molly Bradford. "But when push comes to shove, if Paul is their man, we
know we can throw that 'Texas' thing right down voters' throats like
the Republicans did with 'Swiftboat' and 'Flip-Flop' four years ago."
As Horvath pointed out, there could be some consolation even if Paul
doesn't prevail.
"At least if Rudy Giuliani or Hillary Clinton wins, in four years, New
Yorkers will feel at least as stupid as we do."
