Australia Couldn't Accept Military Rule in Fiji
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer spoke Thursday to Fiji's
military ruler, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, and made it clear
Australia could not accept military rule in Fiji.
A spokesman for the foreign minister was quoted by the Australian
Associated press as saying that Downer told Commodore Bainimarama the
inclusion of Speight or any of his supporters in the Fiji government
would be unacceptable while Commodore Bainimarama stressed his main
concern was the release of the hostages.
Heading a 6-member group, George Speight took Fiji's Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry and most of his cabinet members as hostage in the
parliament house on May 19. A breakthrough was reported this evening
when Speight and Bainimarama hold their second face-to-face talk. A
spokesman for Bainimarama indicated afterwards that there was
possibility that Speight would be included in a civilian government.
Australia opposed firmly toppling with unconstitutional way a
democratically elected government in Fiji and revoking a relatively
fair 1997 constitution.
Fiji enjoys close economic and military cooperation with Australia.
Meanwhile, Downer confirmed Australia and New Zealand would concentrate
on the release of the hostages before deciding whether sanctions should
go ahead.
"Our joint judgment is that we think the wise thing to do is this: wait
until the hostages are released, keep the pressure on Speight as best
we possibly can," Downer told Sydney radio 2UE.
"Once the hostages are released, that is the opportunity for us to talk
yet again with the Fiji authorities about our desire to see democracy
restored and constitutional government reestablished, " he stressed.
Australia and New Zealand have been liaisoning with other nations,
including India, Britain, the United States and Japan, about the events
in Fiji.
After the 1987 coup in Fiji, the country's commonwealth membership was
ceased for ten years and suffered a tough sanction.
