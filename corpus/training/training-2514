Agassi opts out of Australian Open 
World number seven Andre Agassi will not contest the Australian Open
tennis championships in January, an official said Friday.
Agassi's brother Phillip telephoned Open organisers Thursday to break
tell them the 1995 Open winner would not be coming.
Paul McNamee, tournament director of the first Grand Slam of the year,
acknowledged the absence of Agassi was a blow.
"It's disappointing that Andre will not be playing but he clearly feels
he needs some time off," McNamee said.
"I'm encouraged that Andre considers this to be a one-off and intends
to be back in 1998," he said.
Agassi plans to play the Grand Slam Cup in Germany next week but will
not start his 1997 schedule until after the Open in Melbourne from
January 13.
