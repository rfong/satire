Australian Zoologist Reveals Coral Reef Mystery 
An Australian zoologist has discovered a new way to understand the
formation and destruction of coral reefs around the world.
Alan Marshall of the School of Zoology of La Trobe University in
Melbourne said that there might be an unknown force behind the
formation of coral reefs, other than the widely believed effect of
coral-algae interactions.
It is traditionally believed that algae living in coral cells help to
accelerate the calcification process of polyps in the formation of
coral reefs.
But experiments carried out by Marshall showed that coral polyps
without algae in their cells calcify at the same rate as those with
algae.
This proved that coral is not relying on the algae to carry out its
calcification, instead, it is helping the algae by producing the carbon
dioxide it needs, he said.
His discovery has turned the traditional explanation of the formation
of coral reefs upside down.
He said that there are two types of coral in the world. One has algae
in it and the other does not. The traditional theory was only based on
the observation that calcification rate of the first type of coral was
faster during day time, when the algae carried out photosynthesis. The
process was much slower at night when the algae's photosynthesis was
not active.
The algae might be able to switch off the calcification process of
coral polyps at night, because it does not need much carbon dioxide
when its photosynthesis stops, he said.
But the traditional theory ignore what was going on in coral cells
without algae, he said.
"My speculation is that there must be other unknown factors that
controls the formation of coral reefs," he said.
Scientists have yet to explain why polyps, which are only four cell
layers thick, spend hundred of years to develop such a large lime-stone
skeleton. Coral reefs cover two million sq km of the global surface.
The biggest one, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, extends 2,000 km.
Another mystery is "coral bleaching," which is widespread in equatorial
tropics. Coral bleaching happens when sea temperature rises, with coral
expelling the algae from its body. After the algae is driven off, the
coral dies.
There are speculations that global warming may be responsible for coral
bleaching.
Marshall's discovery will help to explain these mysteries by looking
the process of coral reef development in a different way.
