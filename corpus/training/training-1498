UN Security Council bars Republican Guard units in southern Iraq 
The United Nations Security Council late Saturday approved a resolution
demanding that Iraq refrain from deploying elite Republican Guard units
in the south of the country and from reinforcing its military capacity
on the Kuwaiti border.
The measure, backed by Russia, took note of Iraq's "readiness to
resolve in a positive manner" the question of recognizing Kuwait's
sovereignty but insisted that Baghdad must "unequivocally commit
itself" to such recognition.
The resolution stipulated that Baghdad must "immediately complete the
withdrawal of all military forces recently deployed to southern Iraq to
their original positions."
It also said Iraq must not re-deploy such forces to the south "or take
any other action to enhance its military capacity" in the region, which
is near the Kuwaiti border.
Earlier Saturday US Defense Secretary William Perry acknowledged that
Iraqi forces were no longer in a position to attack Kuwait.
His remarks and the UN Security Council resolution came at end of a
week-long standoff between Iraq and the west. The crisis was triggered
October 7 when Washington charged that Baghad had deployed 80,000
troops -- including its formidable Republican Guard -- near the Kuwaiti
border, reviving fears that it was about to re-invade the emirate it
overran in August 1990.
In the face of a massive deployment of US ground and naval forces in
the region, Iraq earlier this week began pulling back and, in a joint
statement with Russia on Thursday, said it was prepared to recognize
the sovereignty of Kuwait as well as the border established by the
United Nations following the Gulf war in 1991.
