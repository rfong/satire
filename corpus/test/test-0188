Yugoslav Forward To Sign For Miami Heat 
Predrag Danilovic, a Yugoslav national team forward, said Thursday he
was signing for the Miami Heat in the National Basketball Association.
The 25-year-old, 2.02-meter (6-foot-7) Danilovic has played the last
two seasons for Italian champion Bologna where he averaged over 20
points per game.
He said he had offers from Real Madrid in Spain and Greek clubs, but
chose Miami because of ``financial and sports reasons.''
``It's a great challenge to play in the strongest basketball league in
the world,'' Danilovic said. He refused to reveal financial terms of
his four-year contract with Miami.
Danilovic will be the third player from Serb-led Yugoslavia to join an
NBA club. His former Belgrade Partizan teammate, Vlade Divac, has been
playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, and Zarko Paspalj used to play for
the San Antonio Spurs.
The three will lead Yugoslavia at the European Basketball Championships
in Athens, Greece, later this month where they are expected to play
wartime rival Croatia which includes Boston Celtics' Dino Radja and
Chicago Bulls' Toni Kukoc.
