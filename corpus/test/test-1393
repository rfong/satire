Plane Held Hostage by Muslim Gunmen Sits in France 
Islamic radicals who hijacked an Air France jetliner from Algiers and
killed three passengers proposed Monday exchanging hostages for a news
conference, one of a series of changing demands, a local official said.
The five gunmen had been demanding the plane be refueled and flown on
to Paris from Marseille, where it landed early Monday after a 40-hour
standoff in Algiers.
The hijackers, at least one of whom belongs to Algeria's radical Armed
Islamic Group, ``seem determined'' but ``endlessly change their
demands,'' said Deputy Governor Jean Ballandras.
He said the latest demand was to hold a news conference in exchange for
the airplane's hostages. It was not clear whether it would be an
exchange for all or some of the 172 captives aboard the Air France
plane.
Ballandras said that direct talks had been established between the
hijackers and French officials in the control tower, including regional
Governor Hubert Blanc and Marseille Police Chief Alain Gehin. ``The
line is open,'' he said. The Airbus A-300 pilot had been serving as
intermediary during earlier contacts.
The French news agency, Agence France-Presse, reported earlier that the
gunmen threatened to execute more passengers if the plane was not
refueled. The agency, quoting ``reliable sources,'' later reported that
the ultimatum had been withdrawn.
The director of Marseille's Marignane airport, Henri Roux Alezais, said
there were ``some indications'' the hijackers were getting tired. He
cited the way they were asking questions through the pilot, but did not
elaborate.
The hijackers, armed with at least two Kalashnikov assault rifles and
two automatic pistols, seized the plane Saturday morning as it prepared
to leave for Paris.
The hijackers killed three passengers -- an Algerian policeman, a
Vietnamese national and a Frenchman -- while the jetliner stood on the
tarmac in Algiers. Sixty-three passengers were freed.
About 40 of the remaining 172 passengers and crew were French, and most
of the rest were thought to be Algerian. Gehin said they were being
``treated well.''
Algerian officials had said one of the hijackers was a member of the
Armed Islamic Group, the most radical Muslim extremist faction in
Algeria.
The group has claimed responsibility for most of the deaths of the 71
foreigners killed in the last 15 months as radicals tried to starve the
Algerian government of the foreign technical expertise it needs to run
its oil and other industries.
The Islamic Salvation Front, Algeria's banned fundamentalist movement,
``denounces and condemns this hostage-taking, ... those who ordered it,
its authors and their demands,'' said a statement from the group's
exiled executive branch in Germany.
France, which once ruled Algeria, has been the extremists' chief
target, and 23 French citizens have been killed.
More than 11,000 people have died in the insurgency, which began in
January 1992 when the army-installed government canceled the second
round of parliamentary elections to stop Islamic fundamentalists from
winning.
Monday was the third anniversary of the first round of elections, which
fundamentalists won overwhelmingly.
It wasn't clear what the five hijackers wanted, aside from going to
Paris. A news report said they had demanded freedom for two jailed
Muslim leaders. But an Algerian Interior Ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Sunday they had dropped that demand.
Gehin said the plane had been supplied with food and water, but would
not say whether it had been, or would be, refueled.
Air France had said while the plane was in Algeria that it had only
enough fuel to fly to southern France, because fuel was used up on
lighting and air conditioning during the standoff.
Security forces and fire fighting equipment were positioned at the
Marignane airport, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Marseille,
when the plane landed at 3:35 a.m. (0235 GMT) Monday.
A local government source said a second Airbus carrying members of a
special intervention force had also landed at the airport.
Air France President Christian Blanc joined Gehin and other local
officials in the control tower, sources said.
France gave permission for the Air France plane to come to France after
a French Embassy employee aboard, identified as Yannick Beugnet, was
killed Sunday night.
While the aircraft was still in Algiers, French Foreign Minister Alain
Juppe had said that ``means of intervention'' had been placed on alert.
Algerian Interior Minister Abderahmane Meziane Cherif criticized the
plane's pilot, whom he blamed for ruining a plan to free the hostages
and six of the 12 crew members as early as Saturday.
The pilot, ``who was certainly under enormous pressure, showed himself
more flexible towards those who held him and the others hostage and in
some ways made the operation fail,'' Cherif said.
