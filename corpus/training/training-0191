Haiti, US agree on joint patrols
Haiti and the United States have agreed to begin joint patrols on
Friday, a top Haitian official told AFP.
The official said meetings between US Colonel Mike Sullivan and
Lieutenant Colonel Joseph-Michel Francois, the police chief of
Port-au-Prince, were "very cordial" and "positive."
Sullivan commands the 1,000 military police sent by the United States
after one man was killed Tuesday by club-wielding Haitian police who
dispersed a protest as US soldiers looked on.
