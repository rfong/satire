Mason Sets Record to Close on O'Malley 
Carl Mason chipped in for a birdie at the 18th to set a course record
9-under-par 63 and close the gap on leader Peter O'Malley at the third
round of the Benson and Hedges Open.
Mason carded two eagles and six birdies to better by two strokes the
record equaled by O'Malley in Friday's second round. Mason's 209 total
left the Englishman two shots behind the Australian, who settled for a
74 after his approach landed in the water at the last.
``I thought I played absolutely superbly,'' said Mason, who only last
year captured his first two victories in 20 years on the tour. ``I
could never see myself shooting a 63 round here, but every shot came
out of the middle of the club.''
Tied with Mason for second was Italy's Costantino Rocca, whose 64
would've been a record on the Jack Nicklaus-designed St. Mellion course
had it come a day earlier. England's Mark James, whose 71 gave him
three sub-par rounds in three days, was fourth on 210.
The 41-year-old Mason had four birdies in a row from the second,
another at the long seventh to go out in 31, then sank a 30-foot eagle
putt at the 545-yard 12th.
After 3-putting the par-3 14th for his lone bogey, Mason made a
40-footer at the 16th for another eagle before he closed the round with
a chip that found the flag from 10 feet off the green.
``For some reason it all came right,'' Mason said. ``I felt good on the
practice range. I had a 61 in the third round of the Scottish Open last
year and went on to win. I hope it's the same result tomorrow.''
O'Malley, who led Colin Montgomerie by five strokes overnight, led the
field by as many as six before finishing 5-5-5-6 over the final four
holes.
Montgomerie failed to register a birdie in a round of 75 that left him
six strokes off the lead.
Indications that the course was ripe for a record came early when
defending champion Seve Ballesteros went out in 30, but the Spaniard
lost a ball in the gorse at the 13th for a triple-bogey 7 and ran up
two more bogeys and managed only 40 for the back nine.
``It was one of those rounds where everything was going nice and
smoothly until one tee shot,'' said Ballesteros, who shot a 70 for a
218 total.
