US envoy denies Africa rift with France 
US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose denied
Wednesday any particular rift with France over African policy, after a
series of Franco-US spats centred on the continent.
Speaking after talks with French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain
during a trip to Paris, he played down the tension that appeared to
emerge from the Zaire refugee crisis or the election of a new UN
secretary-general.
"There has always been more agreement among us than there have been
differences," Moose told reporters. "That remains true today as it has
always been."
Moose and Godfrain discussed the refugee situation in the Great Lakes
region of central Africa, in particular a French proposal for an
international conference on the problems of the region, as well as
tension in the Central African Republic.
Godfrain was at the centre of one of the more spectacular Franco-US
rows last year after he accused President Bill Clinton of playing to
the black American vote by sending then secretary of state Warren
Christopher on a tour of the continent shortly before the US elections.
During his Paris visit, Moose also met President Jacques Chirac's
African affairs advisor Michel Dupuch, Emergency Humanitarian Action
Minister Xavier Emmanuelli and top foreign ministry officials.
US diplomats said Moose's visit was in response to a French proposal to
hold Franco-American talks on the situation in Africa. French diplomats
say it was part of regular contacts over policy.
"It was a good meeting," Moose added after 30 minutes of talks with
Godfrain. He was scheduled to leave for Brussels later Wednesday.
