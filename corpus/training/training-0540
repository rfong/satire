Dollar, European Shares Recover 
The dollar staged a modest recovery today, as traders cashed in on the
firm German mark in profit-taking. European shares also returned to the
positive territory.
The abrupt surge of the German mark on Monday amid political
uncertainties in Italy and France was reversed. There have been fears
of central banks' intervention on the dollar. And the remarks by
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer that the foreign exchange movements
have been exaggerated gave the dollar a short boost.
The U.S. currency closed around 1.3905 marks and 100.35 yen compared
with 1.3825 marks and 99.65 yen on Monday.
Other European currencies, such as French franc and Italian lira, which
plunged a day ago, steadied.
The French franc rallied about 1.5 centimes to 3.5165 marks ahead of
Wendesday's Franco-German summit in Bonn.
President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl are expected
to stress their commitments to a strong franc.
But the market remains wary of the impending non-confidence vote in
Italy which threatens Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's government,
leaving lira's fate unclear.
European stock markets followed the dollar's upward movement, also
helped by the bullish Wall Street.
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
shares ended 3.8 points higher at 3,535.3. The Paris CAC-40 index was
up 3.07 at 1,724.21, while the Frankfurt DAX-30 share index rose 6.18
points to finish at 2,113.60.
