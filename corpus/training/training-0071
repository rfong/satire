U.S. Company to Fund Environmental Protection Center 
The Houston Investment Group of the United States will provide 150
million U.S. dollars and advanced equipment to build an environmental
protection center in this scenic city in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
According to an agreement signed between Guilin City Government
departments and a Hong Kong company representing the U.S. conglomerate
recently, the project will feature sewage treatment, exhaust gas
control, garbage treatment, environmental protection education and
afforestation in the urban area.
The five tasks will be accomplished in stages, and the American
conglomerate will first pump in 30 million dollars to build a water
supply system surrounding the city and another 50 million to 70 million
dollars to construct a trash-based power generation network.
Guilin, a popular tourism destination, has a history of more than 2,000
years. It has a typical karst landscape, featuring green mountains,
clear water, fascinating caverns and grotesque rocks. The city is also
the political, economic, cultural and scientific center of the
northeastern part of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
