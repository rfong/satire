Dollar rises above 122 yen in Tokyo trade 
The dollar rose sharply against the yen here Wednesday, briefly hitting
122.12 yen, its highest level in almost four years, dealers said.
At 2 p.m. (0500 GMT), the dollar stood at 122.01 yen, compared with
121.39 yen earlier in the day and 120.98 yen in New York late Tuesday,
and at 1.6513 marks, up from 1.6506 marks earlier and 1.6475 marks in
New York late Tuesday.
"I see active buying of the dollar by US funds, and trust banks are
also buying actively," a city bank dealer said.
"I see only one reason to buy the dollar, which is that there is no
reason to buy the yen," the dealer added.
Dealers said the dollar was expected to continue to rise against the
yen through the balance of Tokyo trading.
"Although investors are worried about sharp rises, their concerns over
possible dollar-selling by the Bank of Japan are weakening at this
level," the city bank dealer said.
"I see profit-taking on the rising dollar, but buying pressure is
stronger than profit-taking."
In the near term, however, ongoing profit-taking is expected to cap the
dollar's upside, the dealer said.
"I think rises in the dollar will be limited to up to 122.10-20 yen at
most, because profit-taking by exporters is expected to emerge at that
level," he said.
Also limiting the dollar's upside against the yen was the dollar's
sluggish tone against the mark, dealers said.
"The main trading at present is the dollar-yen," the city bank dealer
said.
Dealers said investors were likely, however, to buy the dollar actively
against the mark in Europe after the dollar's sharp rises against the
yen.
"The dollar will be bought against the mark and Swiss franc in Europe,"
the city bank dealer said. "The dollar will rise towards the 1.66 mark
level."
"Even if investors turn profit-takers, I expect strong buying support
will emerge at around 1.6500 marks" on the downside, the dealer said.
