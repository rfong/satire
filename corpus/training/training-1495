Whitewater Jury Reach No Verdict Yet 
Jurors in the Whitewater-related trial Friday wound up a full week of
deliberations without reaching a verdict on Governor Jim Guy Tucker and
James and Susan McDougal, President Bill Clinton's former business
partners.
The jury weighing fraud and conspiracy charges against Tucker, James
McDougal and McDougal's ex-wife, Susan, in Little Rock, Arkansas,
returned today for a seventh day of deliberations but were dismissed by
the judge by lunchtime, media reports said.
U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. decided to give jurors a start on
the three-day Memorial Day weekend. They are to return Tuesday.
The McDougals, who were partners with then Gov. Bill and Hillary
Clinton in the Whitewater real estate development, and Tucker are
accused of conspiracy and fraud in obtaining 3 million dollars in loans
from two federally backed lenders during the mid-1980s. Clinton gave
videotaped testimony for the defense.
