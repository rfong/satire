Florida Anthrax Might Have Arrived in Letter to Newspaper 
A letter sent to the mailroom of a Florida tabloid publishing company
could have carried the anthrax bacteria that killed an employee, the
CNN quoted a law enforcement source as saying Tuesday.
In the past week, two cases of inhalation anthrax have been reported in
Florida. U.S. federal agents are investigating whether the cases
resulted from a possible biochemical terror attack.
Robert Stevens, 63, died on Friday of inhalation of anthrax. He was a
photo editor at The Sun, a supermarket tabloid published by American
Media. Traces of anthrax were found at his work station.
U.S. officials on Monday said tests performed on a second man in
Florida, who worked in the company's mailroom, found that he had been
exposed to the bacteria but was showing no symptoms. Both men were
affected by the same strain of the bacteria.
A law enforcement source confirmed to the CNN that the anthrax may have
arrived in the mailroom via a letter.
Anthrax is caused by a spore-forming bacterium, which could be lethal
if inhaled by humans. It is usually an animal disease and rarely seen
in humans. There are no reports to indicate that it can spread from
person to person.
The bacterium is considered to be a potential agent for use in
biological warfare. Fears about its possible use have been lingering
since the September 11 terror attacks in the United States.
But health officials searching for clues to the origin of the strain
stressed Tuesday that they had no indication of any widespread
infection. Employees and recent visitors to American Media Inc. are
being tested for anthrax and given preventive antibiotics.
