Two Hostages Released in Southern Philippines 
Two abducted crew members of a pump boat used to flee by bandits who
raided a southern Philippine beach resort Wednesday were released
without a struggle Thursday morning, the ABS-CBN news channel reported.
The two said the gunmen had apparently no plans to kidnap them for
ransom but had just used their boat to escape pursuing military troops.
The bandit's own boat was damaged in the fire fight
Officials said earlier that not a single guest or staff of the resort
was abducted in the incident Wednesday. The boat crew were taken by the
bandits from nearby Talicud Island during their retreat.
The released boat crew said they counted about 23 bandits armed with
high-caliber guns. The armed men sounded like Muslims although they
also spoke fluently the Visayan dialect.
Two were killed and three others injured when guards of the resort
repulsed the bandits armed with grenade launchers.
