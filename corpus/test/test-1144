US bomber airshow's star, but only for an hour 
Highlights of the day as the 41st Le Bourget airshow opened its doors
to the public northeast of here Sunday were the strategic US B-2 bomber
and Boeing's new commercial bi-reactor B-777 plane.
American businessmen were out in force at the airshow in the hope of
boosting export sales to compensate for reductions in US military
budgets.
But the B-2 "Spirit" bomber, seen outside the United States for the
first time, was on show for barely an hour before being whisked away
from the many spectators who had come to view it. The plane itself is
very flat and not easily detected by radar.
In civil aviation meanwhile, Boeing has developed a new bi-reactor
B-777 whose maiden flight took place last week.
The plane is in direct competition with the A-330 and A-340 developed
by the European Airbus Industrie consortium. Highlighting the fierce
competition between the two groups, Boeing Commercial Airlines chairman
Ron Woodward told a press conference the company's aim was to corner
two thirds of the market for planes with over 100 seats.
Earlier Sunday, he announced the signature of an outline agreement and
two contracts to sell 12 Boeing B-737-800 airliners to European air
companies.
The Spanish company Air Europa signed a draft agreement to buy eight
planes, while Eurobelgian and Austria's Lauda Air both pledged 94
million dollars for two B-737-800, with the first delivery planned for
May 1998, he said.
On Saturday President Jacques Chirac, who opened the airshow, called
for cooperation with Europe as the only viable way of boosting the
French air industry.
"We have to build an industry of sufficient size on a European scale to
be competitive," he said.
The only way of facing up to the challenges facing the French space and
aeronautical industries was with a "determined European strategy," he
added.
"In return there should be a natural preference to choose European," he
said in a hint seemingly aimed at Britain. He had earlier met British
Prime Minister John Major for a summit in Paris.
London has to decide soon between US and European-designed helicopters
for its armed forces.
Meanwhile, space technology was poorly represented at the airshow
despite the presence of a model of the 50-metre long European rocket of
the future, Ariane-5.
The American space agency NASA was absent as was the Commonwealth of
Independent States. Visitors had to trudge over to the stand of the
French space agency CNES to see a model of the Russian space station
Mir.
And the fact there was no mock-up of the future international space
station R-Alpha, under joint construction by the United States, Russia,
Canada, Japan and Europe, just served to push home the fact that
budgets for space development have been hugely slashed.
