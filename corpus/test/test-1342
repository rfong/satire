Ravalomanana leads, but second round likely in Madagascar vote 
Results released Wednesday in Madagascar's presidential vote show
challenger Marc Ravalomanana maintaining a 10 percentage-point lead
over President Didier Ratsiraka but point to a likely second round of
voting.
Ravalomanana's share of the vote had fallen from a healthy 75 percent
on Sunday, when results came in from the capital Antananarivo where he
is mayor, to under 50 percent on Wednesday.
His lead has been gradually whittled down as results came in from rural
voting districts, where more than 80 percent of Madagascar's 6.3
million voters live.
At noon on Wednesday, the interior ministry gave Ravalomanana 49.79
percent of the vote, down more than two percentage points from his
51.94 percent score Tuesday, versus 39.26 percent for Ratsiraka, up
from Tuesday's tally of 37.32 percent.
Four other candidates share the remaining 10 percent of the vote.
As of Wednesday, Ravalomanana had earned some 1.6 million votes out of
a total of 3.2 million, and Ratsiraka 1.2 million.
Nearly 4.8 million Madagascans were registered to vote in the
elections, and the turnout was on Wednesday put at 68.22 percent -- a
figure that continues to increase as the results come in.
Around one million votes from the remotest regions of the island nation
remain to be counted.
With Ravalomanana less well known than the president in these regions,
the main presidential challenger holds out little hope of passing back
above the 50 percent mark, while Ratsiraka is expected to add to his
share of the vote.
The industrialist Ravalomanana surprised everyone by winning the
capital's mayoral elections in 1999. At 51, and looking a decade
younger, he has played the youth card.
He heads the country's largest food business and has won the support of
the powerful Madagascar Council of Christian Churches.
Ratsiraka campaigned as the guarantor of political stability, while
Ravalomanana claims that a victory for him would bring "access to
development" for Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world,
with per capita economic output at less than 250 dollars a year.
Final official results of the first round will not be known for a
month, after being approved by the High Constitutional Court. A date
for a second round has yet to be set.
