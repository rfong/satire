Hundreds demonstrate in Belgrade against war crimes bill 
Around 300 supporters of Slobodan Milosevic's Serbian Socialist Party
demonstrated in Belgrade Friday after a senior party member attempted
suicide rather than face extradiction to the UN war crimes tribunal.
The protesters are angry at a new law adopted by the Yugoslav
parliament which will see war crimes suspects handed over to the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The
Hague. The legislation officially entered into force Friday.
The demonstration, held in front of the federal parliament in the
capital, comes after Vlajko Stojiljkovic, a close confidant of
Milosevic and former interior minister shot himself in the head outside
the Yugoslav parliament on Thursday evening.
Waving Serbian and Yugoslav flags, the demonstators shouted "Vlajko,
Out hero", in what a leading socialist member Oskar Kovac said was only
the first of a number of planned demonstrations scheduled to be held
across Yugoslavia.
"Stojiljkovic did not commit suicide, he has been killed by the war
crimes law," Kovac told a press conference in Belgrade.
The former minister was said to be in a critical state early Friday
afternoon.
Stojiljkovic has been charged by the tribunal alongside Milosevic and
three others for his part in atrocities committed by Serb troops in
Kosovo in 1998 and 1999.
The new legislation will allow for the transfer of Yugoslav nationals
who have been indicted by the tribunal as well as non-Yugoslavs wanted
by the court who are found to be living in the country.
