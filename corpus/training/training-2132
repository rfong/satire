Zeroual opens talks to resolve political crisis 
Algerian President Liamine Zeroual on Saturday met with two political
leaders, state radio said, as he resumed talks which could pave the way
for democratic elections.
Tidjani Haddam and Ali Haroun, whom Zeroual received on Saturday
morning, were members of the high state committee which governed
Algeria following the forced resignation of president Chadli Bendjedid
in January 1992.
In the first such discussions since he was elected in November, Zeroual
was to address the issue of legislative elections which his government
has promised to hold.
The government has said the discussions with 55 leading political
figures are an attempt to "consolidate pluralist democracy."
No date has been set for the elections but press reports say they are
likely to take place early next year.
Those expected to take part in the discussions include representatives
of opposition parties which boycotted the November election, but the
outlawed fundamentalists of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) will be
excluded.
Algeria was plunged into civil war which has claimed between 30,000 and
50,000 lives after the cancellation of a second round of elections in
January 1992 which the FIS was poised to win.
