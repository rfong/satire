Negotiations With Maradona Break Down 
Negotiations to have Diego Maradona play for the Santos Soccer Team
have broken down, apparently because the Argentine soccer star is
asking for too much money.
Pele and Maradona met about three weeks ago in Rio de Janeiro where
they agreed that the sports promotion firm owned by the Brazilian
soccer legend, Pele Sports and Marketing, would buy the rights to
Maradona.
Pele said Maradona expressed his desire to play for Santos, Pele's old
club, when his world-wide suspension for testing positive to stimulants
ends in September. The final contract was to have been signed by the
end of this week.
But negotiations hit a snag when Maradona reportedly asked for dlrs 15
million.
``There isn't a team in the world that would sign a contract for that
amount of money,'' Pele told the O Globo television network on
Wednesday. ``I can say that Pele has practically given up on the
deal.''
According to the Jornal da Tarde newspaper, Maradona also wanted to
remain on Argentina's Boca Juniors team for the rest of the year,
joining Santos at the start of 1996.
This demand was unacceptable to Pele, the newspaper said.
Renato Duprat, the owner of the private health-care company which was
to be Maradona's chief sponsor was quoted by the newspaper as saying:
``We failed to reach a final agreement.''
