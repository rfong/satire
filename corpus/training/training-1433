Penal Law Expert, Helped Revise Trial System, Dies at 80 
Giandomenico Pisapia, an expert on penal law who helped modernized
Italy's judicial system, died in his home here. He was 80.
Pisapia, who died Friday night, had been ill for some time, Italian
news agencies reported Saturday. Cause of death was not disclosed.
Pisapia was involved in the overhauling, in the 1970s and 1980s, of
Italy's penal law procedures, a modernization which introduced into the
country's courtrooms such methods as cross-examination of witnesses.
``Among Italian jurists, Giandomenico Pisapia was certainly one of the
most important figures this century,'' said Giuliano Vassalli, a former
justice minister and now a member of the Constitutional Court.
Pisapia was apparently sought after to be justice minister in Lamberto
Dini's Cabinet, but the jurist was already too ill last month to
accept, when the premier was forming his government, the Italian news
agency ANSA reported.
Pisapia was also a noted defense attorney. Among the cases he took on
were some of the corruption probes that came to trial in the last three
years as part of Milan's ``Clean Hands'' political kickback
investigation.
Some of those trials were televised nationally, introducing millions of
viewers to the new courtroom procedures.
