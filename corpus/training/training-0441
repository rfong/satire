Urban Science to Be Assessed In China 
In a move to encourage China's cities to upgrade themselves through the
application of science and technology, the State Science and Technology
Commission (SSTC) yesterday issued a temporary provision to assess the
progress of advanced cities nationwide in developing their economies
through such application.
The SSTC has detailed a target system for the assessment, which
includes four chapters and 114 articles on appraising cities in terms
of economy, society, management, science and technology.
The first assessment wave will begin next month, and all advanced
cities will be awarded certificates of honor.
Then, the assessment will be held every two years.
Since the 1980s, many Chinese cities have used scientific and
technological innovation to promote economic development.
Some 36 cities have been selected as pilot places by the SSTC since
1991. Among them are Sichuan Province's Mianyang, Shandong Province's
Yantai and Zibo and Guangdong Province's Zhongshan and Dongguan.
These cities were successful in promoting urban development to
spearhead their local development drives. Most of them have maintained
an economic growth rate of more than 20 percent for several years.
They did this in part by placing a primacy on scientific policy-making
and developing pillar industries, improving traditional industrial
technology and upgrading products.
Most of China's cities have increased investment in scientific research
and development to boost economic growth, the SSTC said.
China has called for an increase in financial support for science and
technology and has suggested that 1.5 percent of a city's gross
domestic product (GDP) be channeled into scientific research and
development by the end of the century.
Shenyang, capital city of Liaoning Province in Northeast China, already
pours 2.3 percent of its annual GDP into scientific research and
development.
