Arafat: Palestinians Soon To Take Control Of West Bank
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised in a speech here today that he
would soon take control of the West Bank despite Israel's reluctance to
withdraw its troops.
"The message is clear. We are close to taking the rest of the West
Bank," Arafat said. "I feel that we are at the end of a long road."
Palestinians started implementing self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank's Jericho area in May 1994.
Arafat accused Israel of slowing down the implementation of some
articles of the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles, including the
promise to create a land passage between Gaza and Jericho through the
Israeli land that separates them.
He said he had to fly from Gaza to Jericho Thursday in an Egyptian air
force helicopter because Israel has not created the passage for
Palestinians. He insisted that the troop pullout take place.
He also reiterated his commitment to make Jerusalem the capital of
Palestinians.
This is Arafat's second trip to the town since it gained autonomy last
May. He paid his first visit last July after he returned to the Gaza
Strip from exile.
Arafat is expected to stay in Jericho for three days, where he will
also convene the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) weekly cabinet
meeting Saturday.
The Palestinian leader performed Friday prayers here today. He also met
and signed an agreement with visiting U.S. Vice President Al Gore.
Under the agreement, The U.S. will finance two projects at the cost of
65 million U.S. dollars for the PNA.
Arafat is scheduled to lay down the foundation stone of five projects
in Jericho, including the Municipal Council building and a primary
school.
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) have set July 1
as a target date for an agreement on withdrawing Israeli troops from
West Bank towns and holding Palestinian elections.
