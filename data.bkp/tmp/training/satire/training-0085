Disruption/NN at/IN Heathrow/NNP Protests/NNP It/PRP seems/VBZ the/DT bad/JJ weather/NN which/WDT dogged/VBD the/DT UK/NNP in/IN July/NNP is/VBZ continuing/VBG as/IN torrential/JJ rain/NN hits/VBZ east/JJ London/NNP ./.

With/IN nearly/RB 1,500/CD protesters/NNS camping/VBG just/RB north/RB of/IN Heathrow/NNP airport/NN ,/, many/DT had/VBD feared/VBN their/PRP$ protest/NN would/MD cause/VB significant/JJ disruption/NN to/TO holiday/NN makers/NNS during/IN their/PRP$ busy/JJ period/NN ./.

In/IN an/DT unexpected/JJ twist/NN however/RB ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT protesters/NNS themselves/PRP who/WP will/MD be/VB facing/VBG the/DT most/JJS disruption/NN ./.

A/DT record/JJ 60mm/NN of/IN rain/NN fell/VBD in/IN just/RB twenty/CD minutes/NNS ./.

Traffic/NNP controllers/NNS were/VBD unable/JJ to/TO take/VB immediate/JJ action/NN and/CC flight/NN EZ123/NN ,/, which/WDT had/VBD already/RB begun/VBN its/PRP$ descent/NN on/IN Heathrow/NNP ,/, continued/VBD to/TO make/VB its/PRP$ landing/NN ./.

Upon/IN touchdown/NN ,/, the/DT aircraft/NN failed/VBD to/TO slow/VB and/CC began/VBD skidding/VBG across/IN the/DT asphalt/NN ./.

The/DT plane/NN soon/RB left/VBD the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT runway/NN ,/, taking/VBG a/DT direct/JJ course/NN towards/IN the/DT protest/NN camp/NN ./.

Luckily/RB all/DT protesters/NNS managed/VBD to/TO scramble/VB out/RP of/IN their/PRP$ tents/NNS ,/, discarding/JJ half-smoked/JJ cannabis/NN joints/NNS ,/, mood/NN rings/NNS ,/, and/CC love/NN beads/NNS as/IN they/PRP hastily/RB made/VBD their/PRP$ way/NN to/TO safety/NN ./.

The/DT aircraft/NN finally/RB came/VBD to/TO rest/VB having/VBG decimated/VBN the/DT entire/JJ protest/NN site/NN ./.

No/DT passengers/NNS were/VBD harmed/VBN and/CC many/DT gave/VBD up/RP great/JJ whoops/NNS and/CC cheers/NNS as/IN they/PRP disembarked/VBD the/DT aircraft/NN ,/, knowing/VBG they/PRP had/VBD thwarted/VBN the/DT terrorists/NNS illegal/JJ and/CC immoral/JJ attempts/VBZ to/TO disrupt/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT world/NN 's/POS busiest/JJS airports/NNS ./.

In/IN tatters/NNS ,/, the/DT drenched/JJ hippies/NNS have/VBP reluctantly/RB ended/VBN their/PRP$ protest/NN ./.

The/DT individuals/NNS are/VBP now/RB returning/VBG to/TO their/PRP$ homes/NNS ./.

The/DT protest/NN had/VBD gathered/VBN both/DT national/JJ and/CC international/JJ interest/NN ./.
