Writer to be Tried on Kurdish Propaganda Charge 
Internationally known author Yasar Kemal will be tried on charges of
making separatist Kurdish propaganda, a prosecutor said Monday.
Kemal wrote in the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel that Kurdish
villages were burned in an attempt to battle the 11-year separatist
rebellion in southeast Turkey. Western government and rights groups
have made similar charges.
The government denies any military action aimed at destroying Kurdish
villages. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the separatist
fighting.
Kemal's books, including ``Mehmet the Hawk,'' concentrate on the harsh
life of rural Turkey. His books have been translated into various
foreign languages and Kemal is often considered a candidate for the
Nobel Literary Prize.
Kemal is expected to be arraigned later this week, said State
Prosecutor Isa Geyik.
Geyik told the Anatolia news agency that Kemal would face trial under
an anti-terrorism law that calls for a jail sentence ranging from two
to five years and a fine of 50 million to 100 million lira (dlrs 1,250
to dlrs 2,500) if convicted.
Speaking to reporters after questioning by police, Kemal denied he made
separatist propaganda.
``Either the Republic of Turkey will be convicted at this trial or I
will be. If I am convicted, they'll be ashamed to look into peoples
faces ... when I have not committed a crime, especially when I have not
committed a separatist crime,'' Kemal said.
