"Black Box" Developed for Indian Railways 
India's first railway equivalent of a black box has just been
developed, offering help to investigators who struggle to determine the
cause of disastrous train accidents.
According to The Observer of Business and Politics, the
microprocessor-controlled speedometer system, which can also record
other data, has been developed at the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works
(CLW) in West Bengal.
It is being equated with the black box of an aircraft that records
flight data and helps determine the reasons behind a crash.
CLW General Manager N K Chidambaram said the ground-breaking system
would be powered by a memory chip that could help record and store
information on train speed for up to 45 days.
