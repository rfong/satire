Turkish FM Begins Official Visit to Greece 
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem arrived here on Thursday evening to
begin an official three- day visit to Greece.
During the visit here, Cem will on Friday hold talks with Greek
President Costis Stephanopoulos, Prime Minister Costas Simitis, and
sign with his Greek counterpart, George Papandreou, five more
agreements for bilateral cooperation on science and technology, economy
education, sea transport as well as on avoiding customs violations.
Cem, along with Papandreou, will on Saturday attend a conference of
Greek and Turkish journalists and open a cartoon exhibition.
Late January, Papandreou paid an official three-day visit to Turkey,
the first by a Greek foreign minister since 1962, and signed with Cem
four bilateral cooperation agreements on tourism, investment, security
and the environment.
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have closely gone to
war three times over their territorial dispute in the eastern Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the two neighboring countries have
since last June taken effective steps to improve their strained
relations.
Greece has reportedly refused a recent proposal by Turkey for a joint
military-diplomatic committee to explore military cooperation in the
Aegean Sea.
Greece has insisted that the 1988 memorandum signed between the two
countries concerning building confidence in the Aegean is the best
basis for the rapprochement of bilateral relations.
