Top leader of extremist Moslem faction killed in bomb blast 
At least 16 people including a leader of an extremist Sunni Moslem
group, Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), were killed when a powerful bomb
exploded outside a court here Saturday, police said.
Ziaur Rehman Farooqi, patron-in-chief of the SSP, died in hospital from
injuries received in the blast.
SSP President Maulana Azam Tariq was wounded in the explosion and his
condition was stable, doctors said.
Official sources said at least 13 people died at the scene of the
blast, and 50 were rushed to hospital with serious injuries. The dead
included Z.A. Shahid, a photographer for a local Urdu daily Khabrain,
police said.
The bomb was detonated as police were taking the two SSP leaders from
jail to appear in court in connection with a case pending against them
concerning the murders of rival Shiite party leaders.
A police officer said the bomb, planted in a motorcycle outside the
sessions court, "was perhaps the most powerful device ever used" in
Pakistan. The judge escaped injuries.
Witnesses said the bomb exploded when the SSP leaders came out of their
vehicle and supporters were showering them with flower petals.
Thick black smoke engulfed the area, triggering panic among a large
number of people outside the court.
"People were screaming and rushing here and there," a witnbess said
adding that several policemen with torn and partially burnt uniforms
were seen limping from the area.
The local administration chief, Kamran Lashari, said the attack
appeared to be "sectarian."
No organisation immediately claimed responsibility for the blast which
followed the deaths of several leaders of the minority Shiite sect's
political party the Tehreek-i-Jafria (TJP) this month.
Sectarian violence involving rival party militants has claimed scores
of lives in Pakistan over the past few years while about a dozen bomb
blasts, blamed on unidentified terrorists have left more than 80 people
dead in central Pakistan's Punjab province since April last year.
