Eurotunnel in need of 4.5 billion dollar rescue: report 
Eurotunnel is facing financial disaster unless it converts 3.5 billion
pounds (4.5 billion dollars) of its debt into equity, according to a
City report into the company quoted in the British press Thursday.
The report by the debt market specialist Klesch and Company says the
Anglo-French company that operates Channel tunnel shuttle train
services was unlikely ever to pay a dividend unless it undertakes an
emergency restructuring of its eight billion pound (12 billion dollar)
debt by 1998.
The report comes as Eurotunnel is expected to release its
second-quarter turnover figures this week.
