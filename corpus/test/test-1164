River Drifting in Guizhou Attracts Tourists 
Drifting through rapids in valleys in southwest China's Guizhou
Province has become the latest attraction for white-knuckle tourists
from both at home and abroad.
Drifting is a natural sport developed from scientific exploration.
Growing numbers of people enjoy the sport because of the excitement,
and because they feel stimulated and fantastic as they struggle with
fast flowing river currents.
On the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau the province has rich natural resources
for tourism. The spectacular valleys and mighty waters provide a
challenge and opportunity for lovers of drifting, known as a white
knuckle activity because people have to hang 'for their lives.'
Peng Kuaiquan, manager of the Guizhou International Sports Tourism
Agency, said the 12-km-long drift along the Maling River is regarded as
the most attractive tourism program developed by a Sino-French
exploration team years ago.
The program has so far received more than 10 exploration teams from
Japan, Germany and France, as well as thousands of tourists worldwide,
she said.
Some 10,000 domestic and foreign tourists have journeyed to Guizhou
this year to experience drifting along a number of rivers in the deep
valleys, she added.
