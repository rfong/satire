Iraqi FM Heads for Arab Foreign Ministerial Meeting 
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf, heading an official
delegation, left here Tuesday for Cairo, Egypt, to attend the Arab
foreign ministerial meeting scheduled on Thursday.
The meeting will pave the way for the Arab summit on October 21- 22 to
discuss the recent violent conflicts between Palestinians and Israel.
On the sidelines of the meeting, Al-Sahaf is expected to hold talks
with some Arab counterparts to promote Iraq's relations and cooperation
with them, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak led the Arab countries in calling for
an Arab summit which they believe is more necessary then ever before in
the face of the bloody clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli
forces.
Some 100 people, mostly Palestinians, have been killed and more than
3,000 injured in the past 20 days in the clashes, the worst in four
years.
President Saddam Hussein has been invited to the Arab summit, a clear
signal of Iraq's return to the Arab world from which it has been
excluded ever since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
In a letter to Mubarak on October 9, Saddam, who has never left the
country for 10 years, apologized for not being able to attend the
summit, but promised to send a representative there.
But Saddam said he was not optimistic about the Arab summit, because
"the intentions of the Arab heads of state are not the same."
