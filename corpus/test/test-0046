Study Finds Scientists China's Most Prestigious Profession 
Scientists, professors, engineers and doctors remain the most
prestigious professions in the Chinese people's eyes, according to a
recent survey.
So, writers, artists, fashion designers, pop singers and models have
fallen in status, according to sociologist Li Qiang of People's
University in Beijing, who did the survey and compared the results with
those of a similar one in 1990.
People from all walks of life show the same respect for scientists and
professors because they regard technology and education as a very
important thing, Li was quoted by today's "Beijing Youth Daily" as
explaining.
And, farmers and servicemen got more respect than fashion models, real
estate agents and businessmen, the survey show, because people think
the former contribute more to the country than the latter, Li says.
Reporters, editors and TV and radio hosts ranked 21st, 22nd, and 23rd
among the 30 most prestigious professions, coming in ahead of people in
sports and movie director, but behind economists, lawyers, and
musicians.
The survey was done earlier this year among 468 Beijing residents above
the age of 18.
