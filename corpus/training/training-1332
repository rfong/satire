Two Finnish Tourists Abducted in N. Somalia 
Two Finnish nationals have been abducted by Somali gunmen in the
northern coasts, a report reaching here has said.
According to the VHF radio report, the Finnish nationals, a man and a
woman, are reportedly tourists travelling on a yacht along the Red Sea
heading for the Indian Ocean islands of Seychelles.
Somali gunmen of the northeastern Somali Salvation Democratic Front
(SSDF) intercepted the yacht a few days ago by using a small armed boat
and forced them to dock into a village, a few kilometers east of the
port town of Bossaso.
The gunmen have not made their captives public until Monday probably in
fear of being forced to free the hostages, said the report.
Elders from Bossaso have reportedly been denied of access to see the
hostages. The other notable thing is that the abductors had not made
any demands of ransom for the release of the Finnish tourists, nor had
they accused the Finnish yacht of violation or trespassing into the
economic water zones of northeast.
