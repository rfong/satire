Sun comes out against Major 
Britain's mass-circulation tabloid The Sun said Monday it was time to
dump Prime Minister John Major, who has put his political future on the
line in a vote for the Conservative Party leadership on Tuesday.
But an editorial failed to come out in favour of Major's only rival so
far, former Welsh Secretary John Redwood, indicating that the paper
wanted other challengers to step in for the second round which will be
necessary if the prime minister does not win a big enough majority of
votes.
"Vote Major and vote in Labour," the right-wing tabloid said on its
front page in a reference to the opposition party's commanding lead in
the opinion polls, adding inside: "No more, Prime Minister."
The Sun named right-wing Employment Secretary Michael Portillo and
Trade Secretary Michael Heseltine as the "only two men capable of
inspiring the nation and winning back those millions who voted four
times for the Tories but feel disinclined to make it five."
It added, "Britain deserves a real leader. Not a man who's halfway down
a political Sunset Boulevard."
