Characterizing/VBG the/DT experience/NN as/IN ``/`` different/JJ ,/, ''/'' local/JJ grandmother/NN Eileen/NNP Rutherford/NNP ,/, 78/CD ,/, ate/VBD Indian/JJ food/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN Saturday/NNP ./.

Although/IN Rutherford/NNP was/VBD initially/RB reluctant/JJ to/TO try/VB the/DT cuisine/NN ,/, she/PRP was/VBD persuaded/VBN by/IN her/PRP visiting/VBG grandchildren/NNP Melissa/NNP ,/, Brandon/NNP ,/, and/CC Allison/NNP ,/, who/WP told/VBD the/DT septuagenarian/NN she/PRP needed/VBD to/TO ``/`` expand/VB her/PRP$ horizons/NNS ./. ''/''

``/`` I/PRP could/MD n't/RB believe/VB that/IN she/PRP had/VBD lived/VBN through/IN three/CD wars/NNS and/CC the/DT Great/NNP Depression/NNP and/CC never/RB even/RB tasted/VBN Indian/JJ food/NN once/RB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Rutherford/NNP 's/POS eldest/JJS grandchild/NN Melissa/NNP ,/, 22/CD ./.

``/`` I/PRP was/VBD like/JJ ,/, `/`` Grandma/JJ ,/, you/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN to/TO try/VB it/PRP ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ so/RB good/JJ ./. '/'' ''/''

Brandon/NNP ,/, 19/CD ,/, made/VBD further/JJ entreaties/NNS ,/, convincing/VBG a/DT skeptical/JJ Rutherford/NN that/IN Indian/JJ food/NN ``/`` has/VBZ lots/NNS of/IN sauces/NNS ,/, sort/NN of/IN like/JJ spaghetti/NNS sauce/NN ''/'' and/CC repeatedly/RB assuring/VBG her/PRP that/IN she/PRP would/MD like/VB the/DT bread/NN ./.

After/IN Rutherford/NNP 's/POS offer/NN to/TO instead/RB make/VB cold-cut/JJ sandwiches/NNS for/IN everyone/NN was/VBD rebuffed/VBN ,/, she/PRP relented/VBD and/CC accompanied/VBD her/PRP$ grandchildren/NNS to/TO the/DT nearby/JJ Bombay/NNP Delights/NNPS restaurant/NN ./.

``/`` She/PRP only/RB lives/VBZ two/CD blocks/NNS from/IN the/DT place/NN ,/, but/CC she/PRP never/RB went/VBD in/IN there/RB ,/, ''/'' Allison/NNP ,/, 20/CD ,/, said/VBD ./.

``/`` That/DT 's/VBZ just/RB sad/JJ ./. ''/''

According/VBG to/TO Melissa/NNP ,/, upon/IN entering/VBG Bombay/NNP Delights/NNP ,/, Rutherford/NNP seemed/VBD apprehensive/NN about/IN the/DT restaurant/NN 's/POS Hindu-themed/JJ d/JJ cor/NN ,/, sitar/NN music/NN ,/, and/CC Indian/JJ people/NNS ./.

Rutherford/NNP did/VBD ,/, however/RB ,/, offer/VBP a/DT positive/JJ comment/NN on/IN the/DT table/NN 's/POS elegantly/RB arranged/VBN red/JJ linen/NN napkins/NNS ,/, saying/VBG ,/, ``/`` These/DT napkins/NNS are/VBP very/RB nice/JJ ./. ''/''

Rutherford/NNP 's/POS attempt/NN to/TO order/VB food/NN was/VBD mired/VBN by/IN several/JJ setbacks/NNS ,/, including/VBG a/DT struggle/NN to/TO locate/VB her/PRP$ reading/NN glasses/NNS and/CC an/DT assertion/NN that/IN she/PRP did/VBD not/RB know/VB what/WP anything/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN meant/VBD ./.

Despite/IN Allison/NNP 's/POS best/JJS efforts/NNS to/TO explain/VB that/IN the/DT entr/NN e/NN selections/NNS were/VBD clearly/RB divided/VBN into/IN sections/NNS by/IN types/NNS of/IN meats/NNS ,/, seafood/NN ,/, and/CC vegetables/NNS ,/, Rutherford/NNP encouraged/VBD her/PRP$ grandchildren/NNS to/TO ``/`` go/VB ahead/RB and/CC order/VB ''/'' for/IN her/PRP ./.

Witnesses/NNS reported/VBD that/IN Rutherford/NNP seemed/VBD overwhelmed/JJ by/IN the/DT unusual/JJ aromas/NNS upon/IN receiving/VBG her/PRP$ first/JJ course/NN ./.

She/PRP appeared/VBD delighted/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, after/IN she/PRP cut/VBD into/IN the/DT deep-fried/JJ pastry/NN shell/NN of/IN a/DT samosa/NN and/CC a/DT recognizable/JJ pea/NN rolled/VBN out/RP ./.

Rutherford/NNP went/VBD on/RP to/TO talk/VB about/RB peas/CD for/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS ,/, including/VBG an/DT anecdote/NN about/IN how/WRB she/PRP enjoyed/VBD shelling/VBG peas/NNS from/IN their/PRP$ pods/NNS when/WRB she/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ girl/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ cool/JJ that/IN we/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO get/VB Grandma/NNP to/TO experience/VB a/DT whole/JJ new/JJ set/NN of/IN flavors/NNS and/CC textures/NNS ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Brandon/NNP ,/, adding/VBG that/IN it/PRP was/VBD gratifying/VBG to/TO see/VB his/PRP$ grandmother/NN sample/NN coconut/NN chutney/NN and/CC dum/NN aloo/NN vindaloo/NN ./.

``/`` Now/RB that/IN she/PRP 's/VBZ tasted/VBN Indian/JJ food/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB surprised/JJ if/IN she/PRP starts/VBZ coming/VBG here/RB all/PDT the/DT time/NN ./. ''/''

``/`` And/CC the/DT look/NN of/IN awe/NN on/IN her/PRP$ face/NN when/WRB they/PRP brought/VBD out/RP the/DT fluffy/JJ poori/NN bread/NN was/VBD so/RB cute/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP added/VBD ./.

``/`` When/WRB we/PRP deflated/VBD it/PRP with/IN a/DT fork/NN ,/, she/PRP just/RB smiled/VBD ./. ''/''

Rutherford/NNP 's/POS grandchildren/NNS said/VBD the/DT highlight/NN of/IN the/DT evening/NN was/VBD watching/VBG in/IN giddy/JJ anticipation/NN as/IN Rutherford/NNP took/VBD her/PRP$ first/JJ bite/NN of/IN the/DT main/JJ course/NN ,/, an/DT authentic/JJ goat/NN curry/VB dish/NN ./.

According/VBG to/TO Brandon/NNP ,/, Rutherford/NNP raised/VBD her/PRP$ eyebrows/NNS slightly/RB ,/, silently/RB nodded/VBD several/JJ times/NNS ,/, then/RB took/VBD a/DT sip/NN of/IN water/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT remainder/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ,/, Rutherford/NNP ,/, who/WP had/VBD never/RB consumed/VBN goat/JJ meat/NN before/RB ,/, ate/VBD primarily/RB rice/NN and/CC plain/JJ naan/NN ./.

``/`` They/PRP put/VBD an/DT awful/JJ lot/NN of/IN spices/NNS in/IN there/RB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Rutherford/NNP ,/, adding/VBG that/IN she/PRP liked/VBD the/DT sweetened/JJ ``/`` little/JJ ball/NN things/NNS ''/'' they/PRP had/VBD for/IN dessert/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP was/VBD very/RB unusual/JJ ./. ''/''

Following/VBG the/DT completion/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ,/, the/DT Bombay/NNP Delights/NNP waiter/NN asked/VBD Rutherford/NNP how/WRB her/PRP$ food/NN was/VBD ,/, to/TO which/WDT she/PRP responded/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD ``/`` nice/JJ to/TO spend/VB time/NN with/IN -LRB-/-LRB- her/PRP$ -RRB-/-RRB- grandchildren/NN ./.
