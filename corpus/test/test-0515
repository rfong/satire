When is my bye week for this debate season?
So I 'spose by now you all heard about my flameout this past weekend at
the Presidency IV conference and Republican debate. People said I
wasn't an articulate man, I wasn't a smart man, I didn't bathe
properly, I often touched myself inappropriately. I wish I could refute
these charges.
Truth was Big Freddie took a chunk of my campaign fund and put it on
the Dolphins getting 16 1/2 at home. My pappy used to say it don't
matter if you got rabid sheepdogs against sheep, you gotta take a team
gettin' double digits at home. Daddy died a powerful poor. And
apparently betting your campaign fund is illegal. So I guess now you
can say I'm a fiscally irresponsible man.
If I seemed to be mumbling and grumbling it was only me saying "Cover
Moss!" "Hit Brady!" "Jesus, Mary and Joseph tackle someone," over and
over.
I may be 0-2 in debates, but the Dolphins are 0-7, so who's the loser?
And when is my bye week?
