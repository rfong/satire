S'pore Trade Rises 2.8 Pct Last December 
Singapore's total external trade increased by 2.8 percent in December
1996 on a monthly basis, with non-oil domestic exports remaining weak,
the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
Non-oil domestic exports recorded a marginal decline of 0.5 percent
last December as compared with an 8.8 percent decline the previous
month, it said.
Re-exports grew by 9.2 percent in December, while domestic exports of
oil rose by 20.2 percent, due mainly to the continued surge of 19.4
percent in oil prices resulting from cold weather in Europe and the
United States and a shortage of heating oil stock.
On a three-month moving average basis, however, non-oil exports dropped
by 2.8 percent to a level of around 5.36 billion US dollars in
December, while oil domestic exports registered a double digit growth
of 21.7 percent to reach about one billion US dollars in the month.
Imports increased by 1.3 percent in December, largely in computer parts
and peripherals, disk drives, blank computer tapes and discs, jewelry,
parts of color television sets and radios, cigarettes, and transmitters
and transmitter-receivers.
The TDB predicted that total trade growth for 1997 will be between five
to seven percent, probably closer to the upper end of the projected
range. It cited two major reasons as "favorable developments" leading
to the increase.
First, the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)
has projected higher world trade growth of 6.7 percent compared with
6.1 percent in 1996. Second, global electronics demand is expected to
recover by the second half of 1997.
For the whole year of 1996, the TDB said that Singapore's total trade
grew by 5.1 percent to reach around 258.21 billion US dollars, slower
than the 13.2 expansion in 1995.
The slower trade growth was due mainly to the cyclical slowdown in
global demand for electronics and related products, it said.
