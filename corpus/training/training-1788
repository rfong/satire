Bank of Greece intervenes heavily to support drachma: dealers 
The Bank of Greece intervened massively Friday to support the drachma,
which closed at 150.70 to the German mark from 149.9 on Thursday,
dealers said.
During trading the drachma had fallen to 154 to the mark. It has lost
two percent of its value this week.
The chief foreign exchange dealer at Citibank in Greece, Yorgo
Kondoyannis said: "The situation is very tense as it was last Friday
and the central bank has had to use 500 million dollars to support the
rate of the drachma."
Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that "the Greek
government is satisfied with the state of the drachma because the
measures taken are paying off" and the government "is absolutely
determined to maintain its monetary policy".
The overnight interbank rate rose to 500 percent. On Monday the central
bank had increased its overdraft rate to 180 percent per year to
discourage speculation.
The bank has reserves of about eight billion dollars. Dealers said that
the amount spent on Friday was the biggest so far this week. They
estimated that the bank had spent more than 500 million dollars on
defending the currency throughout selling pressure this week.
Dealers expressed strong reservations about the chances that the
government could avoid a devaluation of 10-20 percent.
Inflation is rising and was running at an annual rate of 10.5 percent
in April. The debt exceeds 150 percent of gross national product (GNP)
and the budget deficit is nearly 18 percent of GNP. Exports represent
only 30 percent of imports.
Reports on Greek radio said that managers of the central bank were
meeting repeatedly and that Friday was a "crucial day" for the drachma.
