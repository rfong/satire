4 Injured at Gymnastics Worlds 
Four gymnasts have been injured at the world gymnastics championships
with Aleman Manvel of Mexico still in Tianjin Hospital.
"All the cases were not very serious in the doctors' point of view,"
championships' chief doctor Liu Keqiang said here on Monday.
Manvel, the most seriously injured among the four, lost his
consciousness when he fell on the ground with his head during a warm-up
floor exercise two days ago, the doctor said.
Manvel suffered a broken neck reminiscent of a tragedy of Chinese women
gymnast Sang Lang, who was paralyzed after a training accident during
the Goodwill Games in New York last year.
Fortunately, Manvel did not hurt his nerve like Sang Lan and he would
fully recover for sure, the doctor said.
South Korean Yong Chol Ri strained his right ankle in the men's vault
competition.
"Yong Chol Ri suffered a swollen ankle and could not stand or walk
afterwards. He got a fractured ankle," Liu said.
Yong Chol Ri is expected to fully recover in six weeks.
Finland's Jani Tanskanen, the 1997 world champion on high bar, suffered
a dislocated shoulder when he fell off the high bar in Monday morning's
qualifying competition.
Manvel has had himself insured by a Mexican company while Yong is
insured by the the Chinese People's Insurance Company.
