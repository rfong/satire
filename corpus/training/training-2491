Yushan County, Cradle of Talent in E. China 
Yushan County in Jiangxi Province is known as "the cradle of talent,"
because it is the birthplace of more than 120 graduates with doctoral
degrees.
Since the 1980s, nearly 10,000 students from the county have gone to
colleges and universities nationwide, and 100 of them progressed beyond
the master's degree.
Many of these well-educated people from Yushan are now engaging in a
variety of fields at home and abroad, and some of them have become
celebrated in their fields.
The large number of intellectuals coming from this small area is due to
the great attention given to education by the local people, 98.5
percent of whom have gone at least to middle schools, and fewer than
one percent of the local adults are illiterate.
