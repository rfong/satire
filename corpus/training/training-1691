All Children From China's Smallest minority group Receive Education 
One hundred percent of school-age children of the Hezhe nationality,
the least populated of China's 55 minority groups, have enrolled in
primary school in the past few years.
Moreover, there have been quite a number of university and post
graduate students of the Hezhe, which before the founding of New China
in 1949 had only two students to complete primary school.
The Hezhe population has risen from 300 in 1949 to the current 4,000.
Most of them live near the two banks of the Heilongjiang River and the
Wusuli River in northeast China's Heilongjiang province.
The minority group has its own spoken language but no written language.
The central government has provided special funding for the development
of education in the Hezhe-occupied region. Primary schools have been
built in all of the three counties that are home to the nationality.
The state has been offering financial assistance for those schools and
giving each Hezhe student a small amount of aid each year.
China has also established preferential policies for schooling and
employment of minority young people.
Statistics show that more than a dozen Hezhes have received higher
education. Soem of them have become deputies to the National People's
Congress, government officials, engineers, doctors, artists or
teachers.
