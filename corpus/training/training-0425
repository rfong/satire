Ghana Records $1.3 Billion Investment in 4 Years 
The Ghana Investment Promotion Center has registered 780 investment
projects valued at 1.3 billion U.S. dollars between September 1994 and
December 1998, the Pan-African News Agency (PANA) reported Friday.
PANA quoted Deputy Director of the center Cletus Kosiba as saying
Thursday in capital Accra that out of the project numbers, 246
estimated at 260.4 million dollars were wholly foreign owned and 534
projects costing one billion dollars were joint ventures.
He noted that the total investment of 1.3 billion dollars received so
far "was made up of 997.04 million dollars of foreign direct investment
and 269.7 million dollars in local investment."
"These investments were expected to generate a total employment of 45,
300 for Ghanaians and 2,800 for foreigners mainly in the manufacturing,
agriculture, building and construction and services sectors of the
country," Kosiba added.
In 1998 alone, he said, the center registered 187 projects in various
sectors estimated at 177.44 million dollars, which comprises of 164.82
million dollars foreign capital and 12.61 million dollars of local
contribution.
Since the inception of the privatization policy four and a half years
ago, there has been a steady growth in foreign and joint venture
investment.
"We will step up our efforts and sharpen strategies to develop and
expand the domestic capacity to absorb foreign direct investment in
order to guarantee meaningful cooperation between domestic and foreign
investors," Kosiba pledged.
