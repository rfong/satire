Manila urged to respect human rights in anti-terror fight 
The Philippines should take a tougher stand against international
terrorism but must guard against threatening human rights and
democracy, a senior US official and Filipino legislators said
Wednesday.
Their comments came amid growing public opposition to a proposed bill
aimed at fighting attempts to make the Philippines a base for
international terrorists.
The proposed law would allow certain arrests to be made without
warrants, as well as telephone tapping and access to suspects' bank
accounts.
Critics have accused President Fidel Ramos of pushing the bill and
other measures intended to fight a wave of bank robberries and ransom
kidnappings as a prelude to imposing strong-arm rule similar to
Ferdinand Marcos' martial law regime.
Winston Lord, US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, said Wednesday that in his meeting with Filipino
officials he stated "the need to fight crime and terrorism
internationally."
But he also "expressed hope that human rights would be respected."
"There is always a debate and some tension in a free society like the
Philippines between order and liberty," said Lord, who is on the Manila
leg of an Asian tour.
"We would show a sympathy for the need for your president and your
congress ... to get at this problem of terrorists without infringing
unduly or unfairly on human liberty," he added.
Ramos' sister, Senator Leticia Shahani, said over state television that
she would seek revisions to the proposed law -- which she described as
a "double edged sword" -- to tone down its effects on individual
liberties.
"I would also be very careful about violations of human rights and I
certainly would not want a return to martial law under the guise of
protecting the citizenry against terrorism," she added.
Police have said international terrorists were trying to set up a base
in the Philippines and could be plotting to sabotage the annual summit
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum here in November.
They cited the arrest of 35 suspected Pakistani and Middle Eastern
terrorists last year and their alleged links to Ramzi Yussef, the
reported mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York.
Yussef was also linked to a mid-air blast inside a Philippine Airlines
jet over Japan in December 1994, in which a Japanese man was killed,
and a plot to assassinate visiting Pope John Paul II here last January.
