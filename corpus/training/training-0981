Israeli forces move into two West Bank villages 
Israeli troops backed up by tanks on Friday moved into two Palestinian
self-rule villages in the north of the West Bank and captured at least
three people, witnesses and Israeli state radio said.
Witnesesses and state radio reported that troops backed up by some 20
tanks and two assault helicopters moved into Saida, near the town of
Tulkarem, and state radio said that troops had also entered a village
near Jenin, also in the north of the West Bank.
The radio said members of an elite unit were combing Saida in a bid to
arrest Islamic extremists, and had captured at least one member of the
radical Islamic Jihad group.
It said at least two other Islamic Jihad activists had been captured in
the other incursion.
