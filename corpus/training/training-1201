Australian Truce Monitoring Group to Arrive in Bougainville
Australia announced today that 19 Australians will arrive in the rebel
island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea (PNG) Saturday to start
truce monitoring operations.
The Australians will form part of a team of 85 monitors drawn from New
Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
and Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said in a joint statement.
"Their main function will be to observe and report on the truce agreed
between the parties to the Bougainville conflict in October and to
provide information to the Bougainvilleans on the truce process," they
said.
The Australians, all civilians, come from the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defense, the Australian Federal
Police and the country's official overseas aid organization AusAID.
The ministers said the 19 Australians are expected to stay in
Bougainville until late January.
A truce agreement was reached between the parties of the Bougainville
conflict, including the PNG government and rebel groups on the island,
in October in New Zealand.
The two ministers said Australia has committed more than 91 million
U.S. dollars for the reconstruction of Bougainville and the restoration
of services on the island.
