Libya says US has no right to talk of human rights 
Libya said Saturday the United States was in no position to speak about
the state of human rights around the world and accused it of ignoring
abuses in its own backyard.
Responding to the annual US State Department report on human rights, a
Libyan offical said: "It would have been more logical for the United
States to concern itself with the violations of human rights at home,"
which he said had been highlighted by "several international
organisations."
He said the United States therefore had no right to call itself "the
guardian of human rights in the world."
The US survey of 194 countries and territories was published on
Thursday.
Libya is under both US and UN sanctions because of its alleged support
for terrorism.
