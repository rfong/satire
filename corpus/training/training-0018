Oil drilling in Soyo could resume in four months 
Oil drilling in Soyo, in northern Angola, the country's second largest
field after Cabinda, could resume in four months, an expert with the
national oil company Sonangol said.
The installations at Soyo were largely destroyed during fighting
between the UNITA armed opposition forces and government troops.
Regular troops took control of the town at the end of October.
An expert at the Angolan oil ministry estimated the cost of
reconstruction at 200 million dollars.
Before the installations were destroyed, Elf-Aquitaine of France,
Fina-petrole of Belgium and Texaco of the United States all operated in
Soyo.
