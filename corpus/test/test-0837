Clinton Renews Offer for Russian Sub Rescue 
President Bill Clinton Wednesday renewed the U.S. offer for the rescue
of 116 sailors of a Russian submarine sunken at the bottom of the
Barents Sea, the White House said.
White House National Security Council spokesman David Stockwell said
Clinton made a 25-minute telephone conversation with Russian President
Vladimir Putin.
"They discussed a number of areas. President Clinton expressed concern
over the situation involving the Russian submarine and renewed his
offer to help," Stockwell said.
Clinton made the call to return the one Putin made last week in which
the Russian president wanted to give Clinton an update on the talks he
had with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat about the Middle East
peace process.
The two leaders discussed their upcoming meeting in New York when they
attend the U.N. Millennium Summit on September 6-8.
Stockwell said Clinton and Putin also talked about the welfare of
Edmund Pope, an American who has been imprisoned in Russia since April
3 in Moscow on espionage charges.
