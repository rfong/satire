Netherlands to Fund Tanzania's Education Program
The Dutch government will contribute one billion Tanzanian shillings (about
1.25 million U.S.  dollars) to the International Textbook Project of
Tanzania's Ministry of Education and Culture, the Guardian newspaper
reported Tuesday.
The goal of the project is to improve the quality of primary education
in the African country by providing one book for every three pupils,
said a statement issued here by the Royal Netherlands Embassy on
Monday.
The project, which will be completed by July 1 next year, will be co-
funded by the European Union, the British Department for International
Development (DFID), the Dutch government and the Swedish Agency for
Development Cooperation (SIDA).
Tanzania launched the use of a new curriculum in the primary schools in
1997. The shortage of textbooks, however, has been a major constraint
on speeding up the implementation of this new curriculum.
