Just When The '80s Seemed Harmless... 
Record companies apparently have emptied the vaults of music from the
'60s and '70s, so it's on to the '80s. Like it or not.
Sometimes considered the most dreadful decade in rock by some music
writers, the '80s was best-known for two genres above all -- the power
ballad, a dreary radio-friendly concoction of hair bands like Loverboy,
Warrant, Poison, Winger and Guns N' Roses; and new wave, the
synthesizer- and drum machine-fueled soundtrack to a million disco
nights you would probably rather forget.
Driven by boomer nostalgia, labels are falling over themselves to
release new-wave retrospectives, excavating tracks from such
better-forgotten skinny-tie oddities as A Flock of Seagulls, Haircut
One Hundred, Missing Persons and the Knack.
Among the first to the starting gate was ``Rock of the '80s''
(Priority), a 1990 collection of all-of-the-above, plus hits from the
Fixx, Squeeze, Devo, Blondie, General Public and Split Enz. The series
is up to 15 volumes.
The three-volume ``Sedated in the Eighties'' (Right Stuff) is a bit
more hard-edged and includes some punk-inspired tracks from the
Ramones, the Stone Roses, X and Faith No More.
At four volumes, the ``Living in Oblivion'' (EMI) series takes a
slightly more obscure road, adding songs by Tones on Tail and So to
familiar KROQ-FM (106.7) hits by the Thompson Twins and the Motels.
KROQ disc jockey Richard Blade, host of the station's popular
``Flashback Lunch,'' is the mastermind behind ``Richard Blade's
Flashback Favorites'' (Oglio), six CDs of sometimes rare favorites like
Reflex's ``The Politics of Dancing'' and ``88 Lines About 44 Women'' by
the Nails.
But the disco daddy of them all has to be ``Just Can't Get Enough: New
Wave Hits of the '80s'' (Rhino), now at 10 budget-priced,
near-chronological volumes with the final five to arrive next summer.
Using a broad definition of new wave, the series moves from three-chord
punk from the Ramones (``Rock 'n' Roll High School'') politicized
art-rock by the Gang of Four (``I Love a Man in Uniform'') to synth
pioneers Joy Division (``Love Will Tear Us Apart'') and MTV faves Duran
Duran (``Girls on Film'').
Along the way, Rhino rounds up all the usual suspects.
Producer David McLees, who compiled the Rhino series along with Andrew
Sandoval, said he was aiming at two distinct audiences.
``There are the people who were in high school and college when these
songs first came out on radio and MTV,'' McLees, 34, said. ``Then,
there's a bunch of people who were much younger then, but realize the
roots of alternative-rock can be found here in tracks by X, the Ramones
and Joy Division.''
Asked why the time span for nostalgia is becoming shorter with each
passing year, McLees paraphrased Alvin Toffler's book, ``Future
Shock.''
``Pretty soon, people will be nostalgic for what happened 10 minutes
ago,'' he said. ``I know it may seem too soon to do the '80s, but the
series is very well-received.''
