North China Experiences Another Floating Sand Weather 
At around 2 pm today another sandstorm hit north China's Tianjin
Municipality.
A northwest wind of five to six degrees caused aged pedestrians to go
into shops immediately for shelter, and plants and flowers on the
roadsides waved in the strong wind.
Local meteorologists said that the wind will remain strong through
tonight, but is expected to abate tomorrow.
Liu Angrang, director of the Tianjin Municipal Meteorological Station,
said that there has been floating sand weather in Tianjin when
sandstorms hit Beijing. The two cities are about 100 kilometers apart.
Meteorologist in Beijing said that all the seven previous seven
sandstorms that began hitting Beijing in early spring can be attributed
to sandstorms in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China.
The region now is still feeling the eighth sandstorm, which started
yesterday afternoon, and has been the longest one so far, said local
meteorologists.
Officials with the region's civil affairs department said a preliminary
survey shows that the economic losses caused by this time sandstorm is
estimated to exceed four million yuan (about 480, 000 U.S. dollars).
Liu Jingtao, chief engineer with the local meteorological bureau, said
that the highest wind speed for the region today reached 27 meters per
second, with visibility under 400-600 meters.
He added that the continuing sandstorm also caused floating sand
weather in provinces and autonomous regions to the south including
Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei.
The region's meteorologists predict another sandstorm for April 27 to
29, which will affect the areas of Beijing, Hebei, and as far south as
the Yangtze River basin.
