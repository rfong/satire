UN chief laments death of Kim Il-Sung 
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Saturday lamented the
death of North Korean President Kim Il-Sung, calling him a historic
figure.
Boutros-Ghali "has been saddened" to learn of Kim's death Friday and
extends his condolences to the late president's family and the people
and government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, according
to a statement by the secretary general's spokesman.
Recalling "with pleasure" his meeting with Kim last December in
Pyongyang, Boutros-Ghali said the founder of the socialist republic was
"a figure of historic proportions."
Kim, who died of a heart attack at age 82, ruled North Korea since the
founding of the Stalinist state in 1948.
Boutros-Ghali also noted that Kim's death "comes at a particularly
untimely juncture on the eve of a landmark meeting" in Pyongyang with
South Korean President Kim Young-Sam.
North and South Korea, which fought a four-year war from 1950-53, were
preparing to hold their first summit at the time of Kim's death.
