FBI beefs up internal surveillance 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is beefing up its internal
affairs department which examines cases of alleged misconduct by its
agents, the FBI said Wednesday.
The number of staff at the department has been doubled from 30 to 60
people, added the FBI.
"We are determined to maintain and enforce the highest standards of
ethical conduct by FBI employees," said FBI Director Louis Freeh.
"The manner and speed with which we identify, investigate and
adjudicate allegations of serious misconduct on the part of FBI
employees reflects directly upon our ability to perform our significant
law enforcement and national security functions," Freeh added.
The department is being reconstituted as a seperate entity from the FBI
and its director, Michael DeFeo, will report directly to the FBI chief.
The reorganisation takes place against a wave of criticism of the FBI
for its handling of certain recent investigations.
Prominent among such cases was the investigation into last July's bomb
attack at Centenary Park in Atlanta, Georgia during the 1996 Olympics.
