Archaeologist Tired Of Unearthing Unspeakable Ancient Evils
When archaeologist Edward Whitson joined a Penn State University dig in
Hasake last year, he did so to participate in the excavation of a Late
Bronze Age settlement rich in pottery shards and clay figurines. Whitson
had hoped to determine whether the items contained within the site were
primarily Persian or Assyrian in origin.
Instead, he found himself fleeing giant flying demon-cats as he ran
through the temple's cavernous halls, jumping from ledge to ledge while
locked in a desperate struggle for his life and soul for what seemed
like the thousandth time in his 27-year career.
"All I wanted to do was study the settlement's remarkably
well-preserved kiln," said the 58-year-old Whitson, carefully recoiling
the rope he had just used to clamber out of a pit filled with giant
rats. "I didn't want to be chased by yet another accursed manifestation
of an ancient god-king's wrath."
Over the course of his career, Whitson has been frequently lauded by
colleagues for his thorough, methodical examinations of ancient
peoples. He has also been chased by the snake-bodied ophidian women of
Al'lat in Israel, hunted down by Mayan coyote specters manifested out
of lost time and shadow in the Yucatan, and hounded by the
Arctic-sky-filling Walrus Bone Woman of the early Inuits.
"It's true, I've got to stop reading the inscriptions on ancient door
seals out loud," Whitson said. "I also need to quit dusting off
medallions set into strange sarcophagi, allowing the light to hit them
for the first time in centuries. And replacing the jewels that have
fallen from the foreheads of ancient frog-deity statues--that's just
bad archaeological practice."
Whitson added that he hopes one day to excavate an ancient Egyptian
monastery or marketplace without hearing the ear-splitting shrieks of
the undead while being swarmed by green-glowing carnivorous stink
beetles.
"I realize I'm entering grounds that are considered sacred to these
people," Whitson said. "But that doesn't mean I deserve to be pelted
with poison-tipped darts shot from cavern walls. A simple 'Do Not
Enter' sign in hieroglyphics would suffice."
Turning to the subject of his latest incident at a dig site in Peru,
Whitson maintains he was not at fault for summoning the forces of evil.
"I was just idly rearranging flint sickle blades that had already been
catalogued. Apparently, I spelled out the true name of a long-dead
god-priest," Whitson said. "Can't a man even clean up his work area
without inadvertently conjuring up a pack of lightning-breathing
ocelots?"
Making matters worse, such encounters have had little to no scientific
value.
"It's always, 'I will drink your soul' or 'I will chew the flesh from
your bones' with these hellish apparitions," Whitson said. "When I ask
them if that means the ancient Etruscans did, in fact, add copper to
their mixing clay to make their urns more sturdy, they don't even seem
to hear me."
Worn down by nearly three decades of peril, Whitson said he plans to
move off the front lines to become a museum curator or in-office
researcher.
"It's unfortunate," Whitson said. "Nothing quite compares to being out
in the field on an actual dig. But the reality is, I'm really starting
to hate almost getting killed all the time."
