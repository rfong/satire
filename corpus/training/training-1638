Cola War Enters Indian Courts 
A intense cola war entered Indian courts on Friday with Pepsi accusing
its rival Cola-Cola of engineering defection of key employees, bottlers
and consultants through unfair and illegal means.
After hearing Pepsi's plea, Justice C. M. Nayar of Delhi High Court
issued notices and summons to Cola-Cola and 15 others but refused to
grant exparte injunction sought by Pepsico India to stop alleged
inducements by Cola-Cola in offering employment to Pepsi's employees
during pendency of the suit.
Arguing for Pepsi, senior advocates Ashok Desai and Arun Jaitley
contended that Cola-Cola "rattled by the huge success of Pepsi in India
entered into a conspiracy during the last six months to cause loss and
damage to Pepsi's business interests by adopting unfair and illegal
means."
Pepsi outperformed the Atlanta-based Cola-Cola in India with a growth
of 27 percent against 21 percent posted by Cola-Cola in the first
quarter of this year.
Pepsi, emerged as leader in soft drinks in India, claimed that
Cola-Cola has approached many key managers and has been successful in
luring a commercial manager of its bottling business.
While initially these approaches were sporadic and without a pattern,
over the last six months it is clear that Cola-Cola has changed its
strategy and has decided to consciously target and approach key
employees of Pepsi at various locations in India, Pepsi said in its
plaint.
The advocates told the court that the Cola-Cola's action would directly
harm the business interests of Pepsi, which has invested over 300
million U.S. dollars in the South Asian country for the establishment
of business infrastructure.
