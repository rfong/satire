Thomas Cook posts 2000/2001 sales of 8 bln euros 
Europe's second-largest tourism group, Thomas Cook of Germany, Thursday
announced annual sales of more than eight billion euros (nine billion
dollars) for the year ended October 31, up around 60 percent from a
year ago.
Around a quarter of the sales were generated by Thomas Cook UK, the
company acquired last April by C und N, the second-largest tourism
group in Germany. C und N also adopted the British company's name to
form Thomas Cook.
The company said it expected profits for the year before tax and
amortization of more than 150 million euros, an increase of over five
percent from the previous year.
The number of tourist clients increased by about 30 percent to over 14
million, but the company said it expected a fall in demand for the
current financial year.
Corrected for the effects linked to the takeover of Thomas Cook UK, the
clients served rose by three percent, the group said.
Thomas Cook AG, the second-biggest tourist and travel agency in Europe
and third-biggest in the world, is jointly owned by the airline
Lufthansa and the retail company KarstadtQuelle.
