GCC's GDP Expected to Be 203 Billion Dollars 
The combined gross domestic product (GDP) of the six Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states this year is projected at near 203 billion U.S.
dollars, according to a bank report obtained today.
The British Bank of the Middle East (BBME) also projected the GCC
economies to grow by as much as 3 percent in the next two years.
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
In 1992, the GCC members' GDP was estimated at 199 billion dollars, the
bank said.
Between 1992 and 1994, the GDP of the six countries might have dropped
to about 195 billion dollars because of lower oil prices, the BBME
estimated, noting that the latest figures are difficult to obtain.
The bank expects the oil production to rise slowly as most GCC
countries have capacities exceeding current production levels and would
want to raise the output to meet the international demand.
The six GCC states produces some 13.7 million barrels of oil per day
under the quota imposed by the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries
(OPEC).
Oil prices are expected to range between 16.50 dollars per barrel in
1996 to 16.90 dollars in 1997, but this hinges on Iraq's return to the
oil market, the bank said.
The non-oil sector is expected to continue to grow as population
increases. The GCC population, estimated at 25 million, is forecast to
rise by 3 percent or more annually.
Meanwhile, the main producers of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in the
region have been hit by a recent price dip.
Prices for LPG, namely butane and propanes, have been sliding. Propane
for export to the Far East was assessed at 140-150 dollars a ton for
Middle East Tuesday, down from 235-240 dollars a ton in February.
Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait export 14 million, 5 million and 2.7
million tons of LPG a year, respectively.
