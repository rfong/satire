Chirac will visit Israeli parliament 
French President Jacques Chirac will visit the Israeli parliament, or
Knesset, during his official visit to Israel starting Monday, members
of the presidential delegation here said Sunday.
A visit to the Israeli parliament on Tuesday has been added to the
French head of state's program, they said, but he will not be giving a
speech to the body.
A member of the presidential delegation said Chirac had "readily agreed
to modify his program" to pay a visit to the Knesset.
Israel's speaker of parliament, Dan Tichon, has threatened to boycott
official functions during Chirac's visit if the French president failed
to address the parliament.
"It is unacceptable that President Chirac is not coming to the
parliament whereas it is customary for a president on an official visit
to address the Knesset," said Tichon, a deputy in the rightwing ruling
Likud party.
Chirac, who is in Syria on the first leg of his Middle Eastern tour, is
scheduled to address the Palestinian legislative council in Ramallah
during his visit, the first world leader to do so, but he reportedly
did not respond to an Israeli invitation to address the Knesset.
The move provoked concern in Israel's Labour party as well as Likud.
Ranan Cohen, head of Labour's parliamentary group, sent a message to
Chirac urging him to visit the Knesset which he said represented all
political currents in Israel.
Chirac's predecessor, Francois Mitterrand, addressed the Knesset during
his 1982 visit to Israel.
Tension between Israel and France emerged even before the start of
Chirac's trip, when Paris announced Thursday that Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette would not after all be accompanying Chirac to Israel
from Monday to Wednesday.
This was seen as an open protest at Israel's opposition to the French
minister visiting Orient House, the Palestinian Authority's unofficial
headquarters in East Jerusalem.
Chirac is to visit Syria, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Jordan,
Lebanon and Egypt during his six-day tour aimed at carving out a
greater role for French and European diplomacy in the region.
