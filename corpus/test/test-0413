Britain Likely to Be Out of EU Border Vote 
Britain and Ireland could possibly have no say in the decision-making
process in a future border-free European Union (EU), a Dutch diplomat
said Monday.
However, under a proposal submitted to EU treaty negotiators,
representatives from non-EU members, Norway and Iceland, would be
allowed to vote on matters relating to the border-free lands of the
Schengen Agreement.
Many EU member states expect the 1985 Schengen Agreement, a pact signed
by most EU countries which abolishes border controls and increases
cooperation on police matters, to be extended to the EU when a new
treaty might be drawn up this summer.
The Dutch diplomat said it would be difficult to imagine that Schengen
members such as Norway and Iceland, though they were non-EU members,
could not take part in the decision-making procedures.
Britain has said that it will not lift its border controls, while
Ireland, which cannot join Schengen without London, has an open border
with Britain.
