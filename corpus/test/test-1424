Iraq, South Africa to Cement Cooperation 
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan and visiting South African
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad have pledged to cement cooperation
between the two countries.
While expressing satisfaction with the development of the bilateral
ties, Ramadan said at the talks with Pahad Sunday evening that "there
are huge potentials for both countries to further enhance cooperation
between our two friendly countries."
The developing countries are capable of establishing wide-scale ties
with each other and also able to build up their countries away from
foreign aid, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted Ramadan as saying
Monday.
Iraq would continue its construction and development efforts despite
the stringent embargo imposed on it since 1990, said Ramadan.
Pahad, who arrived here over the weekend with a 30-member delegation
mainly grouping businessmen from major South African firms, said his
visit was aimed at cementing cooperation with Iraq.
South Africa was very keen on developing relations with Iraq in
political, economic and cultural fields.
Members of his delegation were keen on assessing the demands of the
Iraqi market and trying to meet them, said the South African minister.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf and Trade Minister Mehdi
Salah also met with Pahad on Sunday to discuss ways of enhancing
bilateral cooperation, said INA.
