Italy Says Public Accounts in 1999 the Best Since 1961 
Italy's 1999 budget deficit of 1.9 percent of gross domestic product is
the best result under this heading since 1961, when the ratio was 1.6
percent, and is especially significant in light of the economic
slowdown during the year, said Istat, the Italian National Statistics
Institute Wednesday.
Reporting the surprise performance in curbing the 1999 deficit by
nearly 18 trillion lire (about 9 billion U.S. dollars) under the '98
figure, to top the most optimistic government forecast of a 2 percent
deficit/GDP ratio, Istat cited the surge in tax revenues which more
than offset worries about the economic downturn.
Istat said a revision of the public accounts also disclosed the
excellent trend of the national debt, down from 116.3 percent of GDP in
1998 to 114.9 percent last year.
The institute said reduced interest rates in the euro area led to
savings of 22 trillion lire (about 11 billion U.S. dollars) in debt
servicing in Italy, a figure nearly equal to that of an entire annual
budget of recent years.
On the other side of the ledger, Istat said GDP grew by 1.4 percent
last year, compared to the government's conservative forecast of 1.3
percent, but dipped from the figure of 1.5 percent for 1998 which
resulted from reviewing the accounting which produced the earlier
figure of 1.3 percent growth in 1998.
