Riyadh refuses to bow to pressure from bombing 
Saudi Arabia will not change its policy because of an unprecedented
bombing that killed six people at US military offices here, the
official Saudi Press Agency said.
"This odious crime, which is the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia's
history and foreign to our morals, will only strengthen our commitment
as a government and people to the divine path," the SPA said.
Saudi Arabia strictly applies the teachings of Islam.
"We will continue our efforts to support Arab and Islamic causes and
strengthen our international relations," the SPA said.
"Saudi Arabia is a model of security and calm. It fears criticism from
nobody. The world's leaders have expressed their determination to stand
up to this crime," SPA said.
"The perpetrator or perpetrators" of the attack "acted after noticing
how unified the Saudi family" was about this policy, it said.
Saudi Arabia is the strongest ally of the United States in the Gulf
opposite enemies like Iraq and Iran, and Washington considers it a
strategic region because of its oil wealth.
A car bomb exploded Monday outside offices used by US military
officials to train the Saudi national guard, killing six people,
including five Americans, and wounding up to 60 others.
Claiming responsibility for it were two secret organisations, the
"Tigers of the Gulf" which demanded the departure of US troops, and the
"Islamic Movement for Change."
