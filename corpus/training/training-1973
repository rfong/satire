Agassi waltzes home in Vienna 
Andre Agassi turned the Vienna tournament into a re-run of the US Open
final on Sunday when he beat German favourite Michael Stich to lift the
title.
Agassi, who had beaten Stich in three sets at Flushing Meadow on
September 11, dropped one here before coming through 7-6 (7/4), 4-6,
6-2, 6-3 against the second seed.
"I made a good start, and then I lost my concentration in the second,"
said Agassi. "After that, everything was alright again."
But he added: "I knew before the match that I would have to play well
today to win."
The American, seeded third, hit an impressive array of winners in the
first set -- with excellent returns, inch-perfect passing shots and a
series of winning volleys and lobs.
But his game went astray in the second, when the 24-year-old claimed
that spectators were ruining his concentration, and Stich's fine
serving brought his total of aces to 17 in the opening two sets.
The rest of the match went Agassi's way though, and Stich became
increasingly unsettled as his shots became more and more inconsistent.
Agassi seized his first break opportunity in the third, and went to
complete victory in two hours and 48 minutes.
The win moved him up to eighth place from 10th in the world rankings.
