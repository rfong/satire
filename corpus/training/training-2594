US hopes Serbs get message from bombing 
The United States hopes that new actions coordinated by NATO and UN
forces, including air raids on Serb positions, will help end the siege
on the Bosnian enclave of Bihac, a State Department official said
Tuesday.
Spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the United States remained in
consultation with the UN Security Council and NATO on efforts to
protect the UN-declared safe haven under control of the Moslem-led
Bosnian government.
"It is certainly our hope that further actions could and would be taken
in full agreement between the UN and NATO," she said. "Air action is
certainly a possibility and one of the things that will be discussed."
Shelly said US officials hoped the show of force would discourage Serbs
from continuing their assault, but added, "the military actions of the
Bosnian Serbs certainly at this point don't suggest that's the message
that they have received."
The US official confrimed that Serb forces were supported by a
helicopter firing rockets.
NATO raids were ordered on Serb positions in coordination with UN
peacekeeping forces now in the region to protect civilians.
