Japanese Entrepreneur Aids Guizhou with Agro-Training Center 
Southwest China's Guizhou Province, one of the country's least
developed areas, will receive 200 million Japanese Yen (about 1.76
million U.S. dollars) to promote agricultural training programs in the
province.
Ryoichi Jinnai, chairman of the board of directors of the Japan
International Cooperation Foundation, signed an agreement with Guizhou
here today to start the project.
The Japanese entrepreneur will provide 200 million yen to build a
provincial agro-training center and improve educational facilities of
six secondary agro-technical schools.
The program also plans to aid agro-technology training for farmers in
Danzhai County, located in the southeastern part of the province, which
is inhabited mostly by the Miao and Dong ethnic groups.
Ryoichi Jinnai has aided northeast China's Heilongjiang and Jilin
provinces, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and east
China's Shandong province with 1.7 billion yen (nearly 15 million U.S.
dollars) since 1994.
