Japanese growers opposed to lifting ban on US apples 
Some 250 apple growers in Japan expressed strong opposition Friday to
importing US apples, saying that the product did not meet Japan's
quarantine standards.
During a two-day hearing which ended on Friday, participants demanded
more proof US apples would not bring in moths or viruses.
Despite opposition, the Japanese government has no plan to change the
scheduled lifting of the ban on apples from the United States starting
in October, officials said.
Japan, bowing to US pressure, agreed last year that it would lift the
ban on American apples. The ministry already inspected planned
shipments of US apples to Japan in May in Washington.
Officials of the ministry of agriculture, forestry and fisheries said
that it would hold another hearing for apple growers in the near
future.
In June last year, the ministry decided to lift the import ban on
apples from New Zealand as it had complied with technical limitations.
The first major shipment from the country arrived at the western port
of Kobe in May.
