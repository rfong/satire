Schools Closed Down in Tehran For Air Pollution 
Iranian Education Department of Tehran Province has decided to shut
down elementary schools in some major cities of the province Monday due
to the serious air pollution in recent days.
The cities are the Iranian capital of Tehran, Shahr Rey and Shemiranat,
the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
The decision was made upon the recommendation of the Environmental
Protection Organization, which has warned of severe air pollution
partly due to the stagnant weather in Tehran.
The air pollution, which befell Tehran days ago due to the phenomenon
of air reversion in winter, is worsening for lack of winds and
precipitation, plus the pollutants released by the huge fleet of
worn-out automobiles.
Ten Tehran citizens, three women and seven men, died Saturday because
of the air pollution, and doctors said that the air pollution has
drastically raised the number of heart attack cases in the city.
Environmental experts have called on the citizens, particularly the
elders and children not to go to downtown Tehran, the most serious zone
of air pollution.
They also urged the citizens to use public transportation services
instead of their private cars in order to reduce air pollution.
Earlier reports showed that some 4,000 people every year died of
respiratory problems caused, or exacerbated, by pollution and some
2,000 people die of cancer incurred by health-damaging substances in
the air, such as lead.
