Policeman accused of bugging commits suicide 
A retired gendarmerie captain, who was charged with telephone tapping
while working for French President Francois Mitterrand, committed
suicide on Monday, the centre-left daily Le Monde reported.
Pierre-Yves Guezou, a former member of an antiterrorist unit at the
Elysee Palace, was indicted with four other people last Friday. He was
found hanged at his home in suburban Noisy-le-Grand, the report said.
Mitterrand's former chief of staff Gilles Menage was charged with
tapping the private phones of people including the actress Carole
Bouquet, along with the former head of the anti-terror unit, Christian
Prouteau, former police commissioner Pierre-Yves Gilleron and former
gendarmerie General Jean-Louis Esquivie.
Menage, who headed Mitterrand's staff and is now chairman of the
state-owned electricity monopoly EDF, was charged with privacy
violations.
All five were accused of carrying out illegal phone taps in the mid-80s
on the private lines of Bouquet, the face in a million Chanel adverts,
lawyer Antoine Comte, Le Monde journalist Edwy Plenel and television
reporter Herve Brusini.
Menage refused to comment on the charges, but added "all telephone taps
have to be approved by the ministers responsible and the prime
minister."
