Lovestruck lawyer proposes on back page of Italian newspaper 
A lovestruck Italian lawyer paid 50,000 dollars to say in very large
print that he is ready to settle down, buying the back page of
Tuesday's edition of the Corriere della Sera newspaper.
"Imagine that the last three years are the first of a life together
(our souls, our thoughts)," the lawyer from the northern town of Varese
declared in his proposal on one of the most expensive pages of the
newspaper.
Corriere della Serra is one of Italy's main newspapers, with a
circulation of one million.
