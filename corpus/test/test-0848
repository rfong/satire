US commerce official welcomes Japan's tax cuts, deregulation 
US undersecretary of commerce Jeffrey Garten welcomed a policy of the
new Japanese administration to continue income and other tax cuts to
stimulate consumer spending, a news report said Wednesday.
"My impression is that the new administration is trying to promote tax
reduction, and the United States welcomes it," Jiji Press quoted Garten
as saying in an interview.
He also said Japan's new economic deregulation package, adopted earlier
this month, was "a significant step forward," but it should not be the
end of the issue, the news agency reported.
Garten, who is here to negotiate on automotive sector in wide-ranging
bilateral trade talks, told a symposium Wednesday that failure of the
talks would affect the entire Japan-US relationship.
But he said it would take more time for the two countries to agree on
what indicators to use to measure progress in Japan's market-opening
efforts.
Tokyo has been opposed to Washington's demand to set numerical targets.
Garten's Japanese counterpart, Sozaburo Okamatsu, repeated a Japanese
proposal for the creation of a mechanism involving public and private
sector officials to assess outcome of the auto trade talks.
Okamatsu, vice minister for international affairs at the international
trade and industry ministry, and Garten will hold a subcabinet-level
meeting Thursday to promote talks on automobiles and auto parts, one of
the three key areas of the so-called framework talks.
