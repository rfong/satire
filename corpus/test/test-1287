Man amputates crippled leg under train 
A man who underwent 20 unsuccessful operations to repair a leg
mutilated in a motorcycle crash six years ago amputated the limb Friday
by placing it under a slow-moving train, police said.
Ian Hudson, 28, was listed in "comfortable" condition in Royal
Hampshire County Hospital, where he was taken for emergency treatment.
Authorities said his leg was sliced off cleanly above the knee when he
placed it on the track in front of a railway maintenance locomotive.
"He has never come to terms with being crippled and his leg caused him
a lot of pain," said Hudson's mother, Patricia, 55, of Stanmore,
Winchester. "Ian must have got to a stage where he could no longer cope
with it.
"He loved working outside as a gardener, but that all went when his leg
was injured. His leg was very, very deformed."
She said surgeons had told her son they intended to amputate his leg,
but decided at the last minute to try again to save it and cancelled
the operation.
"I believe surgeons are under an obligation to save a limb if they can,
but I'm not sure that was the right thing in Ian's case," said his
mother.
Hudson's neighbors had reported hearing him screaming in pain at night.
