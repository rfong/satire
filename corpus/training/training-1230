23 People Killed In Traffic Accident Caused By Sleepy Driver 
Twenty-three people were killed when a truck collided head-on with a
bus in northeastern Iran, Tehran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Saturday.
The agency said the truck driver had lost control of his vehicle
because of ``exhaustion and sleepiness,'' causing Friday's accident in
the Mashhad province.
Both drivers and 21 bus passengers were killed, said IRNA, monitored in
Cyprus. It was not clear if there were any survivors.
