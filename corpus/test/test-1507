Chechnya peace talks renewed after Russians apologise 
Peace talks in Chechnya restarted Thursday after the Russian military
authorities in Grozny apologised to Chechen rebel negotiators for a
border incident, a Russian television station said.
Earlier Thursday, the Chechens announced they were suspending talks
after accusing the Russians of not adhering to an accord on exchanging
prisoners.
Private NTV television said the Russian side apologised following a
complaint by the Chechen delegation that it had been prevented from
entering Grozny by members of a Russian control post.
After the brief interruption, the two sides returned to the table to
discuss the thorny political questions -- the status of Chechnya,
elections, future of the separatist leaders -- at technical committee
level.
There were no details on whether military questions, such as the
prisoner exchange agreement, were also back on the table.
Chechen delegation head Akhmed Yarikhanov, who took over from Usman
Imayev on August 1, had sent a protest note to the Russian forces
command in Chechnya saying talks would be suspended until Russia
replied to the note, Russian ORT television said earlier.
The protest note, seen by AFP in Grozny, said "the Russian side is not
adhering to the (July 30) military accord, especially with regard to
the exchange of prisoners."
"Federal troops continue to threaten the use of force," the note said,
adding that Russian authorities in the Chechen capital were preventing
members of the separatist delegation from moving around freely in the
city.
The prisoner exchange failed to take place again Wednesday after being
postponed Monday and Tuesday due to discrepancies in the number of
people held by each side.
The Russians are calling for 54 soldiers to be set free, whereas the
Chechens say they hold only seven prisoners. The Chechen delegation,
meanwhile, has put forward a list of 1,300 missing separatists.
Under a disarmament, ceasefire and prisoner release accord reached July
30, a complete exchange of prisoners was due to have taken place by
Monday.
The accord, signed under the auspices of the Organisation for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), also provided for the gradual
disarmament of Chechen separatists and the establishment of
self-defence groups in each village comprising 25 men carrying light
weapons.
At the same time, the Russians would begin withdrawing two to four
kilometres (one to two miles) from the positions they currently held.
The problems highlighted the fragility of the accord, despite Russian
attempts to promulgate it as the end of the war in the tiny Caucasus
republic.
President Boris Yeltsin, quoted by Interfax news agency, Thursday
stressed that with the signing of the accord "the main obstacle has
been overcome."
"Today we are living closely and peacefully alongside all the republics
within Russia and there are no problems between us," he said during his
meeting with visiting Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
However according to Russian commander General Alexander Naumov, the
situation in the republic had "considerably deteriorated" in the last
few days.
He said Chechen separatist fighters had left their mountain strongholds
in the south of the republic and were now occupying areas in the
valleys "where they are trying to impose their authority," Interfax
reported.
The agency further quoted Russian military sources as saying people
were dying as a result of daily exchanges of fire in Grozny. Two
Russian soldiers were reported killed and seven others injured
overnight Wednesday.
The situation was complicated still more after Russia protested
Thursday over a decree signed August 2 by separatist leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev creating a "regular army" in Chechnya.
"This could create more armed conflict," the Russian forces command in
Chechnya said, according to ITAR-TASS.
"Chechen political leaders must be aware that the Russian authorities
will not allow unauthorised armed individuals in the streets and will
use all means to disarm them."
Between 15,000 and 30,000 people have been killed since Russian forces
stormed Chechnya in December to crush an independence uprising.
