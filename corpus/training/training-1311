At Least 4 Killed in Renewed Fighting in Mogadishu
At least four people have been killed and seven others wounded in a
renewed fighting between the militiamen of faction leader Hussein
Mohamed Aidid and those of his rival, Osman Ali Atto in Mogadishu,
sources said here today.
The heavy armed clashes occurred last night in the generally dark
Somali capital which was lit by the night flares used by the opposing
sides around the fighting zones.
During the fighting which lasted about 90 minutes, no territorial gains
was made by either side, the sources added.
The reason for the renewed fighting is not yet known. However, Osman
Ali Atto's faction has made their usual accusation of blaming Hussein
Mohamed Aidid's men for provoking their front line forces.
There's no official word from the faction led by Hussein Mohamed Aidid
over the fighting as yet, but a militia officer loyal to his faction
has denied that their forces have made the attack.
This fighting between the two clan compatriots was taking place at a
time when international efforts are continuing towards a political
reconciliation for the Somali factions.
Apart from the fighting, the faction leaders of Osman Ali Atto and
Hussein Mohamed Aidid are currently being hosted by President Ali
Abdalle Saleh of Yemen.
It is reported that a meeting between Hussein Aidid and Osman Atto will
take place tomorrow in the capital of Yemen, Sana.
