Dutch holds talks over hooligan violence
The Dutch justice minister on Monday held talks with the country's
anti-hooligan authorities in the wake of the vicious clashes between
hundreds of followers of Ajax and Feyenoord on Sunday that left one dead
and several injured.
Winnie Sorgdrager was expected to meet representatives of the
prosecution service, the Dutch football federation and the mayors of
various towns to discuss ways of stemming a continuing hooligan problem
in the country.
The authorities are particularly concerned at the latest trend of
supporters meeting at a pre-arranged venue well away from the football
grounds with the sole intention of staging a fight.
"This is criminal behaviour, pure and simple, which has very little to
do with football," said Dutch Interior Minister Hans Dijkstal after
Sunday's clashes on wasteland in an area between the Noordzeekanaal and
the A9 Haarlem-Amsterdam motorway.
Police, who made 28 arrests, said they had been taken by surprise after
receiving information that a confrontation, arranged by mobile phone,
might take place at another venue.
Witnesses said sticks, batons and hammers were amongst the weapons used
by the supporters, put at several hundred. Several cars were also set
alight.
On February 16 police seized some 200 weapons, including baseball bats,
knives, molotov cocktails and electric cattle prods, after another
pre-arranged fight between Ajax and Feyenoord fans near a motorway
leading out of Amsterdam.
