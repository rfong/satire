ADB not planning to discuss North Korean membership at annual meeting 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has no plans to discuss the issue of
North Korea joining the bank during its annual meeting in Fukuoka next
week, a Japanese finance ministry official said Wednesday.
"There will be no official or unofficial gatherings to discuss North
Korea's membership," the official said.
But the official, who asked not to be named, said he could not rule out
the possibility of individual ADB members referring to North Korean
membership during bilateral talks or in their speeches to the annual
gathering.
The three-day meeting starting Sunday is expected to draw 3,000
delegates including finance ministers and central bank governors from
the 56 members of the Manila-based bank which is celebrating its 30th
anniversary this year
ADB president Mitsuo Sato reportedly told a Japanese newspaper last
month that North Korea had applied for membership a few months ago.
"I would like to inform member countries of the North Korean intention
as soon as possible, and then I want to start discussion," Sato was
quoted as telling the Asahi Shimbun. The newspaper said Sato was
expected to call on member countries to begin talks during the Fukuoka
meeting.
An ADB official said earlier in Seoul that "substantive discussion may
start in the latter half of this year" but that the formal application
process, which is backed by South Korea, had yet to take place.
In a rare statement of support from South Korea, still technically at
war with the North, South Korea's Finance Minister Kang Kyong-Shik last
month welcomed for the first time the Stalinist state's bid to join the
ADB. South Korea benefitted heavily from the bank in its own post-war
reconstruction.
