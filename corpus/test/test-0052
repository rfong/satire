Hybrid Rice Technology Ready For Large-scale Application 
China will expand the application of hybrid rice technology on some 3.3
million ha of farmland at the end of the century to increase grain
output by 2.5 billion kg a year.
"The two-line hybrid rice technique will be a major contributor to the
central government's target of increasing 50 billion kg of grain a year
by the end of the century," said Lu Xinggui, head of the Hybrid Rice
Engineering Technique Research Center of Hubei Province, one of China's
major rice producers.
In the early 1970s, the invention of the three-line hybrid rice brought
a new green revolution to China's rice production . And hybrid rice
varieties have been grown on more than 13 million ha, accounting for 40
percent of the country's total rice acreage.
The discovery of the photoperiod-sensitive genic mala-sterile rice
resource in Hubei in 1973 made it possible to develop the three-line
hybrid rice into the two-line rice.
By now China has developed eight two-line hybrid rice varieties, and
their cultivation proved that they could raise per-ha grain output by
more than 750 kg, or 10 percent, Lu said.
Early success has also been made in the mid-term trial development of
the two-line hybrid rice, and a trial base has been set up for this
effort in Maoming city of Guangdong Province.
China planted more than 4,000 ha of two-line hybrid rice for seeds this
year, and expects to expand the varieties to some 400,000 ha next year,
Lu said.
But Chinese experts aim to develop some high-quality hybrid rice
varieties by the end of this century that can increase per-unit output
by 15 percent.
