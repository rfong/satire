Mercosur Countries Discuss Common External Tariff 
The Southern Common Market (Mercosur) Chambers of Commerce held a
meeting here today to discuss the common external tariff in the region.
The Chamber of Commerce presidents from Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay
and Chile, and the president of the National Confederation of Commerce
of Brazil attended the meeting.
They will analyze the Argentine government's proposal for raising the
Mercosur common external tariff, and progress in the negotiations in
the commercial bloc.
Chilean specialists said an increase in the common external tariff will
have negative effects on Chilean-Mercosur foreign trade.
They said the tariff will be increased to 23 percent, since the basis
for tariff preferences negotiated in the agreement have a ceiling of 20
percent.
Mercosur, established in December 1994 to promote free trade in the
region, is the biggest commercial bloc in South America. It consists of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Chile and Bolivia are
associate members.
