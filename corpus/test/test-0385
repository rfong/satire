Highway collision kills 15, injures 18 
Fifteen people were killed and 18 seriously injured when one bus
ploughed into another on Cikampek highway, east of here, the Antara
news agency reported Sunday.
One bus broke down and pulled over to the side of the road. The
passengers got off while attempts were made to repair the engine,
Antara quoted a police officer as saying.
Another bus travelling behind, apparently with faulty brakes, slammed
into the first bus.
Ten people were killed on the spot, and five died on the way to
hospital, the police officer said.
Both buses belonged to the Nan Tungga company.
