Later/RB both/DT players/NNS made/VBD it/PRP clear/VBP they/PRP preferred/VBD the/DT old-fashioned/JJ net/JJ cord/NN judges/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT better/JJR way/NN to/TO spend/VB so/RB much/JJ money/NN than/IN for/IN a/DT machine/NN that/WDT does/VBZ n't/RB work/VB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, adding/VBG :/: ``/`` I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP would/MD be/VB better/JJR to/TO play/VB as/IN we/PRP did/VBD in/IN the/DT past/NN with/IN the/DT men/NNS at/IN the/DT net/NN ./.
