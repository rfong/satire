Plague outbreak in India over: French experts 
The outbreak of plague in western India which claimed 58 lives and
spurred trade and travel embargos is over, two French medical experts
said here Thursday.
Visiting professers Jean-Luc Durosoir of the Pasteur Institute in Paris
and Henri Mollaret, former head of the institute's plague department,
also praised the steps taken by New Delhi to combat the disease.
"One can say that the plague outbreak is over," Mollaret told AFP,
adding that Indian health authorities had reacted "rapidly and well" to
the crisis.
The doctors said, however, that it was too early to rule out a future
outbreak of plague, which has made an appearance in India for the first
time in nearly 30 years.
The Press Trust of India reported meanwhile that five suspected plague
sufferers were admitted to hospitals Thursday in the western port city
of Surat, the epicentre of the outbreak.
Mollaret said an outbreak of bubonic plague -- transmitted to humans
through rat flea bites -- had been confirmed in the western state of
Maharashtra but the more virulent pneumonic variety found in Surat was
an enigma.
Although a few cases of pneumonic plague had been identified in Surat,
Mollaret said he was "surprised, as the disease generally spreads in
cold climates with cool temperatures helping bacteria to grow."
Pneumonic plague spreads through airborne germs. The outbreak in Surat
sparked an exodus of an estimated half a million people, causing its
spread to other parts of the country.
The epidemic led members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and several
other countries to sever aviation and shipping links with India. A
number of nations have since lifted the restrictions but some remain in
place.
