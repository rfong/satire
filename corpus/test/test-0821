BRASILIA -- President Fernando Henrique Cardoso called on Brazilian
people on Friday to unite in the face of the country's current
financial difficulties and vowed to cut the government fiscal deficit
in a bid to revive economic growth. "The false belief ... that we would
be incapable of carrying through the fiscal adjustment program ...
prompted Brazilians and foreigners to start withdrawing their funds
from Brazil," President Cardoso said in a nationally televised address
Friday evening. (Brasil-President-Address) - - - - MAPUTO -- The German
