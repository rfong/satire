Indian students boycott exam over leak allegations 
Around 700 post-graduate students in the Indian capital boycotted an
examination for doctoral fellowships after claiming the questions had
been leaked in advance, news reports said Monday.
The students were locked in several examination centres in New Delhi on
Sunday by police after alleging that the papers, set by the University
Grants Commission (UGC), had been sold openly before the exam.
"Suddenly the police came charging and forced us into the examination
hall," a student said at New Delhi's Hindu College. "The main gate too
was locked."
Another student, Monisha Ray, said: "There was total commotion. Five
minutes after the papers were distributed, the students tore answer
sheets, broke window panes and it became a free-for-all."
Students told the Times of India daily that the papers for the National
Entrance Test examination -- which offers a stipend for doctoral
research -- had been sold in university hostels for about 2,000 rupees
(57 dollars).
An exam monitor at Delhi university backed the students.
"There was one student who finished his paper in 15 minutes and wanted
to leave," he said. "It was obvious he had seen the question paper in
advance."
UGC chairman Armaity Desai refused to comment on the charges. The body
is yet to decide whether to cancel the examination.
