Fire prevention measures cut number of blazes in 1995 
Fire prevention measures adopted early last year after a series of
tragedies in public buildings enabled China to cut by 11 percent the
number of such disasters in 1995, the China Daily said Monday.
A total of 2,230 people died in fires and 3,770 were injured last year.
But this represented a 19 percent drop in the number of victims
compared with the previous year, said the paper.
The 38,000 major fires reported in 1995 caused economic losses of more
than one billion yuan (130 million US dollars), ministry of public
security figures showed.
