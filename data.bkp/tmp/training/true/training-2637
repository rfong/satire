In/IN an/DT unusual/JJ public/JJ clash/NN reminiscent/NN of/IN Cold/NNP War/NNP debates/NNS ,/, Russia/NNP 's/POS foreign/JJ minister/NN ,/, Andrei/NNP Kozyrev/NNP ,/, came/VBD to/TO the/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP on/IN Monday/NNP to/TO win/VB sympathy/NN for/IN Saddam/NNP Hussein/NNP but/CC was/VBD roundly/RB rebuffed/VBN by/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Kozyrev/NNP ,/, fresh/JJ from/IN a/DT visit/NN to/TO Iraq/NNP and/CC Kuwait/NNP ,/, criticized/VBD the/DT Iraqi/JJ troop/NN buildup/NN near/IN the/DT Kuwaiti/NNP border/NN for/IN creating/VBG ``/`` a/DT dangerous/JJ situation/NN ./. ''/''

But/CC he/PRP also/RB suggested/VBD that/IN Iraq/NNP had/VBD no/DT intention/NN of/IN invading/NNP Kuwait/NNP ,/, citing/VBG reports/NNS in/IN the/DT Iraqi/JJ press/NN that/IN the/DT troops/NNS were/VBD merely/RB conducting/VBG maneuvers/NNS ./.

Speaking/VBG to/TO the/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, Kozyrev/NNP said/VBD that/IN the/DT joint/JJ communique/NN that/IN he/PRP won/VBD from/IN Baghdad/NNP last/JJ week/NN proved/VBD that/IN Iraq/NNP understood/VBD the/DT need/NN to/TO recognize/VB the/DT sovereignty/NN and/CC borders/NNS of/IN Kuwait/NNP ./.

The/DT Russian/JJ official/NN argued/VBD that/IN the/DT international/JJ community/NN must/MD be/VB prepared/JJ to/TO consider/VB lifting/VBG the/DT oil/NN embargo/NN against/IN Iraq/NNP if/IN it/PRP continues/VBZ to/TO cooperate/VB with/IN U.N./NNP weapons/NNS monitors/VBZ ./.

The/DT presentation/NN was/VBD sharply/RB criticized/VBN by/IN the/DT chief/JJ U.S./NNP delegate/NN ,/, Madeleine/NNP K./NNP Albright/NNP ,/, though/IN she/PRP did/VBD not/RB address/VB Kozyrev/NNP directly/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT Russian/NNP 's/POS words/NNS drew/VBD no/DT support/NN from/IN other/JJ Security/NNP Council/NNP members/NNS ./.

What/WP was/VBD exceptional/VBN about/IN the/DT meeting/NN on/IN Monday/NNP was/VBD that/IN it/PRP pitted/VBD Ms./NNP Albright/NNP against/IN Iraq/NNP 's/POS deputy/JJ prime/JJ minister/NN ,/, Tariq/NNP Aziz/NNP ,/, and/CC to/TO a/DT lesser/JJR extent/NN against/IN Kozyrev/NNP ,/, in/IN a/DT public/JJ Security/NNP Council/NNP forum/NN ./.

Kozyrev/NNP 's/POS remarks/NNS and/CC his/PRP$ presence/NN in/IN the/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP chamber/NN seemed/VBD to/TO give/VB weight/NN to/TO a/DT subsequent/JJ statement/NN by/IN Aziz/NNP ,/, who/WP accused/VBD the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS and/CC Britain/NNP of/IN leading/VBG an/DT unjust/JJ campaign/NN to/TO deny/VB Iraq/NNP economic/JJ relief/NN despite/IN what/WP he/PRP called/VBD his/PRP$ country/NN 's/POS cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ./.

The/DT meeting/NN also/RB drew/VBD attention/NN to/TO the/DT vastly/RB different/JJ approaches/NNS used/VBN by/IN Washington/NNP and/CC Moscow/NNP in/IN dealing/VBG with/IN Saddam/NNP ./.

The/DT United/NNP States/NNPS insists/VBZ on/IN maximum/JJ Iraqi/JJ compliance/NN with/IN U.N./NNP demands/NNS without/IN spelling/VBG out/RP exactly/RB what/WP Saddam/NNP must/MD do/VB if/IN he/PRP wants/VBZ a/DT partial/JJ lifting/NN of/IN the/DT sanctions/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD imposed/VBN after/IN Iraq/NNP 's/POS invasion/NN of/IN Kuwait/NNP in/IN 1990/CD and/CC at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT Persian/NNP Gulf/NNP war/NN the/DT next/JJ year/NN ./.

According/VBG to/TO this/DT line/NN of/IN reasoning/NN ,/, if/IN he/PRP complies/VBZ with/IN all/DT of/IN the/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP resolutions/NNS ,/, he/PRP will/MD probably/RB not/RB survive/VB politically/RB ./.

Russia/NNP ,/, by/IN contrast/NN ,/, follows/VBZ a/DT step-by-step/JJ approach/NN that/WDT takes/VBZ Saddam/NNP at/IN his/PRP$ word/NN and/CC would/MD reward/VB him/PRP in/IN stages/NNS if/IN he/PRP continues/VBZ to/TO show/VB a/DT willingess/NN to/TO cooperate/VB with/IN the/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP ./.
