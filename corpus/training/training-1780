Italian tourist stabbed in Yemeni mosque 
A Yemeni Moslem militant on Saturday stabbed and slightly wounded an
Italian tourist washing his face under a mosque tap in the historic old
town of Taiz, police said.
Laurence Saretta, 45, was assailed at the 400-year-old Al-Mudhaffer
mosque by a Moslem extremist student, who stabbed him twice shouting
"He's a Christian" in the first such attack in the country, they added.
Saretta was treated in hospital and discharged two hours later in the
town 270 kilometres (165 miles) southwest of Sanaa. His attacker, aged
in his 20s, was arrested after being held by the tourist group's driver
as he tried to flee.
"The governor of Taiz Ahmed la-Hajri visited the place to inquire after
the health of Saretta who rejoined his group after treatment," a police
spokesman said.
Tourists have in the past been taken hostage, mainly by Yemeni
tribesmen hoping to use them as bargaining chips in disputes with the
authorities.
About 50 have been kidnapped since 1992 in separate incidents, but all
have been released unharmed.
