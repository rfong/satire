Li Ruihuan Leaves Havana For Kingston 
Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), ended his four-day official
goodwill visit to Cuba and left here today for the Jamaican capital of
Kingston.
During his stay here, Li met Cuban leader Fidel Castro Ruz and other
government and parliament leaders. They discussed ways to further
cooperation in political, economic, trade, scientific and technological
and cultural fields and other issues of mutual concern.
Cuba is the first leg of Li's four-nation Latin American tour, which
will also take him to Jamaica, Brazil and Chile.
Li's visit to Latin American countries, the first ever by a CPPCC chief
since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, is
designed to promote exchanges of high-level visits between China and
these countries, deepen mutual understanding, increase interflow and
cooperation and foster mutually beneficial development.
