Russia sacks air force chiefs over Siberia chopper crash 
Russia has sacked two top air force officials over a military
helicopter crash in Siberia earlier this month that killed all 11
people on board, most of whom were flying illegally, a Russian news
agency reported Saturday.
Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov dismissed the chief of the Siberian air
force named only as Lukianenko and the head of the helicopter unit,
identified as Chipetskiy, who both held the rank of colonel, the
Interfax-AVN agency said.
It said the move followed the results of an inquiry into the May 7
crash, when the helicopter slammed into a mountain at 10,000 feet
(3,000 metres) in the Altai range of southern Siberia.
Investigators have said that although the Mi-8 helicopter with its
three-strong crew was officially on a training flight, the eight
passengers were civilians.
They appeared to have hired the craft with a view to reaching the top
slopes of the mountain from where they planned to snowboard down.
Judicial officials have said the most likely causes of the crash were
pilot error allied to poor weather conditions or technical failure.
The two-turbine, single-rotor Mi-8 is widely used in Russia and experts
generally consider it highly reliable, with most accidents caused by
human failure or faulty maintenance.
