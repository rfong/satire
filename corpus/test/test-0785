Two People Killed in Italy Earthquake 
An earthquake rocked Italy's central region of Umbria early this
morning, killing at least two people and injuring more than 10, a radio
report said.
The two were killed when their house in the mountain village of
Collecurti collapsed in the quake.
The quake caused serious damage to some villages in the Umbria region,
about 150 kilometers from Rome.
The Italian news agency ANSA said that the worst affected areas were
villages in the Appennine mountains near the Assisi town, where
emergency service teams have rushed to start a rescue operation.
The earthquake, which was centered to the north of the Foligno city,
was measured around 4.85 on the Richter scale, Italy's National
Geophysical Institute said.
Buildings in Rome, where earthquakes were rare, shook for several
seconds.
Besides Umbria, the quake were also registered in the nearby regions of
Tuscany, the Marches and Lazio.
