Clinton Meets with South African President Wbeki 
U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday welcomed South African President
Thabo Wbeki's visit at the White House, praising South Africa's
critical role in the new century.
"The vision now needed to define South Africa's critical role in the
new century. You are leading your nation and an entire continent
forward, supporting peacemaking and peacekeeping, fighting against
poverty and illiteracy and for economic opportunity," Clinton said at a
formal ceremony in the White House East Room.
Clinton made the remarks in the term very general while Wbeki pointed
out that the United States must help Africa address many challenges
facing both "our two countries, as well as many other parts of the
world."
"These challenges ... include the human threat posed by deepening
underdevelopment, widespread poverty; diseases such as AIDS, malaria
and tuberculosis; as well as violent conflicts and wars afflicting
especially the continent from which we come, Africa," Wbeki said.
He said he would spend the next four days to meet U.S. politicians,
businessmen and academics and media people to discuss how to bring
peace, social and economic justice for the billions of poor people.
Wbeki appealed to Clinton to act together to meet "challenges in the
ever-widening income and development gap between the rich and the
poor."
