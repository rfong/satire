UAE to Attend International Conference on Children 
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has decided to send a delegation to the
International Conference on Fighting the Sexual and Commercial
Exploitation of Children due to be held in the Swedish capital
Stockholm from August 27 to 31.
The UAE delegation, headed by the country's ambassador to Germany
Mohammed Sultan el Awaiss, comprises government officials from the
Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Labor and Social Affairs, Justice,
Higher Education and Public Health.
The conference, which is organized by the UNICEF in collaboration with
a number of international and regional organizations, is intended to
draw the world's attention to the problems of exploiting children
sexually and commercially, and to seek an appropriate solution to them.
El Awaiss will be entrusted to speak on the policies adopted by his
government to protect the educational, health and social rights of
children, as other services rendered by the government to children.
He will also emphasize that the UAE society is devoid of the problems
which will be dealt with at the conference.
The UAE delegation will participate in discussions held by the legal,
health, educational and other committees of the conference.
Many government and non-governmental organizations will participate in
the conference, but no exact number of participants is available.
