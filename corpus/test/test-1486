Putin Approves Russia's New Military Doctrine 
Russian president-elect Vladimir Putin approved the country's new
military doctrine Saturday.
Putin's decree, which endorses the doctrine and says it takes effect
from its moment of publication, simultaneously rescinds a decree by
former president Boris Yeltsin to approve the previous doctrine.
The complete text of the new doctrine was published in the press
earlier in the day.
