Tasmanian government promises to boost penalty for homosexual sex 
The government of the tiny Australian state of Tasmania has made an
election pledge to increase the maximum sentence for consenting
homosexual sex between adults in private to 25 years.
Tasmania has defied international and domestic pressure to repeal its
laws against homosexual acts, despite the enactment of overriding
federal legislation.
The Liberal state government, which faces the polls in February in what
is expected to be a tough battle for re-election, has outraged gay
activists with its pledge.
Premier Ray Groom promised Thursday that one of the first legislative
acts of a returned Liberal government would be to extend by four years
to 25 years maximum penalties for a range of crimes, including
homosexual sex.
Tasmanian Gay and Lesbian Rights Group spokesman Rodney Croome said the
move flew in the face of international, national and local opinion.
"These laws have been condemned by Amnesty International and the United
Nations," Croome said in a statement.
"They have made Tasmania a laughing stock on the mainland.
"The Tasmanian Anglican and Uniting churches want them repealed and
opinion polls show that a clear majority of Tasmanians oppose them, yet
the state government wants them reinforced."
Groom repeated his government's position that the anti-gay laws should
not be repealed even though nobody had been prosecuted under them for
many years.
Tasmanian AIDS Council executive director Todd Harper said the promise
would backfire.
"The move has nothing to do with law and order or reducing criminal
behaviour," Harper said in a statement.
"It is a cynical move to beat up prejudice and hate before an
election."
