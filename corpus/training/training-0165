Threat of leadership challenge against Major is lifted 
British Prime Minister John Major survived to lead the government
another year when Tory rebels failed to garner the 34 signatures needed
to challenge his Tory leadership by Wednesday's noon deadline.
It had been clear from the weekend that the rebel leaders were about 10
names shy of the requirement. But Marcus Fox, chairman of the Tory
backbench 1922 Committee, made it official when he confirmed, at noon,
that he had received no formal request for a vote.
The Wednesday deadline for a challenge, set by party rules, fell
exactly 14 days after the current legislative session opened with the
Queen's reading of Major's legislative agenda for the year.
It was by just such a challenge four years earlier that Major replaced
Maragaret Thatcher.
On Monday, he survived a House of Commons confidence vote over an
increase in Britain's European Union dues, an issue over which he had
threatened to resign and call elections if defeated.
Although Major triumphed both tests, they were being broadly seen as a
measures of the ill-feeling and deep rifts in his party over Britain's
future in a unified Europe.
