Six confirmed dead in Lahore hospital blast 
Six people were killed and 34 injured Sunday in a bomb attack on a
cancer hospital founded by former cricket star Imran Khan, official
sources said.
Earlier figures put the toll at four killed and 31 injured.
The attack comes a day after Khan announced his plan to found a
political party to struggle against Pakistan's "establishment."
Khan, 43, last June married Jemima, the daughter of Franco-British
billionaire Sir James Goldsmith. The popular former cricket star is
widely viewed as a potential rival to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Bhutto visited the injured in the afternoon and described the attack as
"tragic."
Police said the bomb had been hidden in the toilets. Damage was
extensive and the ground floor of the hospital was devastated.
Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum hospital in memory of his mother, who
died from cancer.
