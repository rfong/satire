For Six Days and Six Nights, U.S. Pilot Waited To Be Rescued
The rescue Thursday of ``Basher 52,'' the 29-year-old American flier
shot down in Bosnia, is a tale of high-tech equipment, survival in the
wilderness _ and luck. This reconstruction of the young flier's story
is based on U.S. and NATO military accounts and other reports from the
region.
He hid in a pine forest for six long days and nights, hoarding the
precious radio batteries that were his only hope of getting home.
To the U.S. and NATO airmen desperately hunting for him, he was simply
Basher 52, the radio call sign of an American pilot shot down by the
Bosnian Serbs.
His real identity was Air Force Capt. Scott F. O'Grady, 29. But it was
never breathed in public for fear of aiding Serbs trying to capture
him.
His comrades did not know if he was dead or alive.
Just before dawn Thursday, they found each other.

Friday, June 2.
O'Grady's F-16C Flying Falcon streaks over the forests of
Serb-controlled northern Bosnia.
Mission: routine monitoring of a U.N. ban on any Serb, Croat or Muslim
air operations in Bosnia.
Altitude: 20,000 feet.
Time in Bosnia: 3 p.m. In Washington: 9 a.m.
A Russian-made SAM-6 surface-to-air missile rises toward O'Grady's
plane, slams into it and slices the plane in half. The pilot of an
accompanying NATO craft reports he saw no sign O'Grady managed to eject
before the plane went down.
The jet ``exploded in midair,'' Bosnian Serb military officials say.
Reported position: near Mrkonjic Grad, 25 miles south of Banja Luka in
an area controlled by Serb rebels.
But it is more than a day before the wreckage of the plane is shown on
Bosnian Serb television, and the Serbs say nothing about what happened
to the pilot.
___
The hunt is on, but information is scarce and often contradictory.
On Saturday, Serb military leaders, perhaps to put NATO off the scent,
tell Western officials they are holding the pilot. The information
cannot be confirmed, however. A spokesman for Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic then declares that ``we have no information about the pilot.''
Two days later, Gen. Ronald Fogelman, the U.S. air force chief of
staff, mentions to reporters at a Pentagon reception that intermittent
signals have been received from what could be the airman's emergency
locator beacon.
The signals are ``encouraging,'' a Pentagon official says. But they
were apparently too brief or too weak to be sure they came from
O'Grady, much less to lead searchers to him.
White House officials are angered by the disclosure, which they
consider premature and possibly dangerous for the flier.
___
O'Grady is in a mountainous, heavily forested area of northern Bosnia.
Few people live nearby. He has bruises from the crash, and minor burns
on his neck.
The weather takes a toll. It's cool and cloudy and rains
intermittently. He is shivering and hypothermic when he's found.
Food is another hardship. He eats the rations he had with him. Then he
survives by eating plants and insects and drinking rainwater.
During the days, he stays still. He moves only at night.
He draws on his survival training. He has been on several survival
courses, including resistance and escape training, honing skills gained
growing up in the Pacific Northwest.

Thursday, June 8:
At 2:08 a.m., a pilot from O'Grady's own squadron, the 555th from
Aviano Air Base, Italy, is flying over Bosnia.
He hears and recognizes O'Grady's voice, calling on the battery-powered
emergency radio. He notifies Aviano.
Within minutes, a NATO AWACS surveillance aircraft picks up the pilot's
signal. His location is pinpointed, several miles from where he
crashed.
NATO commander Adm. Leighton Smith is notified in London. He gives Col.
Martin Berndt, aboard the USS Kearsarge, approval for a rescue attempt.
``If you can do it, do it. We have enough information,'' Smith says.
``I think he knew that we weren't going to give up on him, and he
wasn't going to give up on us,'' Smith later tells a news conference.
President Clinton is notified in the White House by National Security
Adviser Tony Lake. It is now 9:30 p.m. Wednesday in Washington.
``It looks real tonight,'' says Lake. ``It looks like a go.'' Clinton
asks for updates throughout the night.
___
It is 5:45 a.m. (11:45 p.m. EDT Wednesday). The skies are brightening
in Brindisi, Italy, as rescue aircraft and backup take off. A second
team launches from the Kearsarge five minutes later.
The rescuers speed through cloudy skies the 60-mile distance to
O'Grady's position.
Flying in low, two AH-1W Sea Cobra attack helicopters _ armed with
Hellfire and TOW antitank missiles, machine guns and Sidewinder
air-to-air missiles _ hover overhead to ensure that no one is nearby,
and ward off any attack.
6:12 a.m. O'Grady guides his rescuers to a clearing in the rough
terrain by popping a yellow smoke flare.
He knows the pair of Marine Corps CH-53 ``Sea Stallion'' assault
choppers will have a tough time landing.
The first of the Sea Stallions lands. Twenty Marines jump out to secure
the area. A ramp on the second craft cannot go down. Perhaps it is
blocked by a stump or a log.
Berndt runs to the front of the craft and sees what he had hoped for:
O'Grady running out of a pine forest. He wears a flight jacket and
helmet and carries a pistol.
The chopper's crew chief reaches down and hauls him into the chopper.
O'Grady's first words: ``I'm OK. Get me out of here.''
It's 6:44 a.m. Within two minutes of landing they are headed back to
the Kearsarge.
``It won't be very soon that I'll forget the look on his face as he
approached the helicopter this morning,'' Berndt remembers.
``They grabbed him, put a cloak over him, (there was a) big smile, and
he collapses from the emotion, or the exhaustion, or a little of
both,'' Brig. Gen. Terry Murray, a former commander of a Marine
amphibious unit, tells a Pentagon briefing.
O'Grady has a six-day beard and is very talkative, in good spirits _
and so hungry he won't scoff at the military's traditionally despised
prepackaged rations, Berndt says.
Once on board, O'Grady took some water, then ``dug right into a meal
ready to eat, or MRE, so he must have really been hungry,'' Berndt
says.
By 7:30 a.m., the helicopter carrying O'Grady lands safely aboard the
Kearsarge. One hour and 45 minutes after takeoff.
___
Clinton gets the news at 12:49 a.m. EDT. ``Got 'em!'' Lake said.
``Great,'' replied Clinton. ``Sounds like this is one amazing kid.''
___
Once on board the Kearsarge, O'Grady is given a physical examination,
takes a shower and shaves. He calls his family.
Squadron doctor Paul Rocereto says the pilot at first ``looked terrible
and seemed tired.''
About seven hours after arriving on board, Rocereto says, ``He finally
conked out.''
