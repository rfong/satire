At least 33 dead from Oklahoma bomb, 200 missing 
The death toll from a powerful carbomb that devastated a federal
government building here Wednesday has risen to 33, with an estimated
200 injured and 200 missing, officials said Thursday.
The nine-storey building, which was virtually sheared in half, housed a
day-care center and at least 12 children were among those reported
dead.
Attorney General Janet Reno said that some 550 people were assigned to
the downtown building and that those unaccounted for included 20 of the
40 children that were in the day-care center.
Carl Spengler, one of the first physicians to arrive at the scene, said
some the dead children, ranging in age from one to seven, were burned
beyond recognition.
Police Sergeant Bill Martin said 12 children were killed in the blast,
correcting an earlier figure of 17 given by a paramedic.
The city's Fire Chief Gary Marrs said some 200 people had been injured
in the blast, 58 of whom were in critical condition.
CBS television reported that federal experts from around the country
meeting in Oklahoma City late Wednesday said the death toll could go
over 200.
Assistant Fire Chief Jon Hansen said three people were pulled from the
rubble late Wednesday, two of whom died a short time later. A
15-year-old girl
was taken to hospital in critical condition.
Hansen said another woman trapped in the basement of the building had
told rescuers there were two other people down there with her, although
she couldn't tell if they were dead or alive.
"Our firefighters are having to crawl over corpses in areas to get to
people that are still alive," Hansen added.
James Inhofe, US Senator from Oklahoma, also expressed fears that the
death toll could go much higher with many people feared trapped in the
wreckage of the building said to be in danger of collapse.
"We have to come to the conclusion that there are several hundred
people in there, some alive, some dead," Inhofe told CNN.
Rescuers worked through the night despite the increased risk of
cave-ins after a steady rain set in by nightfall.
"Between now and tomorrow we just want to find survivors and hope and
pray that they are there," Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating said. He
declared Thursday a day of mourning.
Oklahoma City Mayor Ron Norick said the blast left a crater 10 meters
(30 feet) long and 2.45 meters (eight feet) deep.
