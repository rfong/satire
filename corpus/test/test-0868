Joint Jordanian-US Military Maneuvres End
The joint Jordanian-U.S. military exercises, codenamed "Infinite
Moonlight '96" and attended by Jordanian Armed Forces and U.S. Marines,
wound up its two-week operations here today.
Abdul Hafez Mirai, Chairman of Jordan's Joint Chiefs of Staff Field,
said that he was satisfied with the outcome of the exercises after
watching the final stage of the exercises this morning at Qatraneh
military base, 70 kilometers south of Amman.
Jordanian military spokesman Yehia Malkawi, Chief Field branch in
Directorate of Military Training at General Headquarters, said at a
news briefing that the exercises were one of the many combined
trainings that Jordanian armed forces has conducted with friendly
forces and part of American-Jordanian military cooperation which was
launched in 1981.
He said the objectives of the war games are "to promote and enhance
bilateral military relationship and to strengthen cooperation between
the forces of the two countries."
Meanwhile, John Garrett, Commander of Marine Expeditionary Unit which
is part of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, told reporters that the U.S. forces
redeployment from Jordan will start today and go through July 10. The
reporters were carried to the drill ground by U.S. armed personnel
carriers early this morning.
Kelly Murphy, an official from U.S. Navy Public Affairs, told Xinhua
that the joint exercises here, the second Jordanian-American war game
this year, is a "very good practice."
Corporal Huff, a U.S. marine, said in an interview with Xinhua that the
exercises were "very interesting."
He disclosed that the U.S. marine troops will go to some Gulf states
after their redeployment from Jordan.
However, Murphy denied what Huff said, saying that no one knows exactly
where the marine will go.
