Sino-U.S. Joint Venture to Produce Valves For Auto Engines 
The U.S.'s TRW and the Shanghai Anting Industrial General Co. have set
up a joint venture to produce valves for automobile engines.
The Shanghai TRW Engine Valve (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. was started with 10
million U.S. dollars in investment, 86 percent from the Americans in
funds, equipment, and technology, and the rest in land and workshops
from the Shanghai partner.
China produced 479,000 automobiles last year, a rise of 24 percent from
the previous year, meaning lively demand for engine valves, company
executives say.
TRW is one of the world's major car parts suppliers, with sales of 7
billion U.S. dollars last year. It has 122 offices and agencies in 23
countries, and produces over 300 million engine valves a year.
