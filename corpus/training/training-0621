Xinjiang to Have 20 Ports of Entry By 2000
With 20 ports of entry open to the outside world by the end of this
century, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will become
a major gate for the country's opening to central and western Asia and
Europe, and an important channel for China's imports and exports in the
next century.
Xinjiang has a 5,400-kilometer-long border line, and borders on
Mongolia, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan
and Tadzhikistan.
With 13 land ports of entry, and two air outlets, Xinjiang has seen
growing border trade. Last year, more than 1.2 million tons of
merchandise and 360,000 people passed through the ports of entry.
In the first quarter of this year, 350,000 tons of goods and 63,000
people entered or left the country by way of these ports, growing by
170 percent and five percen on the same period of 1994.
By the end of this year, the 15 ports of entry are expected to handle a
total of 4.3 million tons of goods and 1.1 million passengers,
according to a regional government official in charge of the ports.
He predicted that Xinjiang's ports of entry will be able to handle a
total of more than 10 million tons of goods and 3.2 million people
entering and leaving China by the end of the century.
