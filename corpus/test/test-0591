NPC Session Opens to People in Guangxi 
Authorities in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have
decided to open the meeting of the Regional People's Congress Standing
Committee to the people.
Tao Huaisheng, 57, a worker at the Guangxi Science and Technology Hall,
was among the first 10 citizens who sat in a meeting of the regional
legislature today.
"This is all new to me. I want to see what's on the agenda of the
legislature and how it works," he said. Wang Yanying, 76, said she has
come because she was told the meeting today is about protecting
wildlife.
The local lawmakers said they want to promote the understanding of the
legislature among the people and promote the development of democracy
in Guangxi.
Citizens above the age of 18 can all apply for passes to the General
Office of the regional people's congress standing committee, official
sources said.
