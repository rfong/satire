Dollar higher on news of Japanese sanctions 
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen Wednesday following the
announcement that the United States was taking action to open Tokyo's
auto markets.
The dollar rose to 83.90 yen at midmorning from 83.53 earlier in the
session after US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said a list of
products that could be targeted for sanctions would be filed in the
coming days.
He also said Washington would lodge a formal complaint with the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) charging that there was
"obvious evidence of discrimination" against US firms on the Japanese
market.
