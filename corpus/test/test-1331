Malaysia's Sabah State to Hold Election Next Month 
Malaysia's Sabah state will hold the ninth state election on March 12
and 13, the Election Commission announced here Tuesday.
Nomination date was fixed for March 2, commission chairman Harun Din
announced at a press conference.
The 48-seat State Legislative Assembly, whose five-year mandate ends on
March 18, was dissolved Monday to pave way for the state election.
The commission's latest electoral roll for Sabah, East Malaysia, shows
an electorate of 726,690, including 13,296 postal voters.
In the just-dissolved assembly, the Barisan National (BN) (National
Front) held 43 seats while the opposition Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS)
(Sabah Unity Party) had four and the remaining one seat was held by an
Independent.
Sabah BN comprises of nine component parties with six parties having
seats in the state legislature and three others no representation in
the assembly.
Besides the 48 elected seats, the state assembly also had six nominated
assemblymen, three each by BN and PBS.
The PBS won the last state election with 25 seats for a simple majority
in the previous state election held on February 18 and 19, 1994, but
the state government collapsed after only three weeks in power when
most of its assemblymen defected to the BN which then formed the state
government.
