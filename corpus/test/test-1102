Coaches call for tougher punishment 
Coaches from around the world condemned US Swimming for not imposing a
competition ban upon a 15-year-old girl who tested positive for
steroids at the US national championships.
US Swimming announced here Friday that its three-member review panel
had imposed only a two-year probation on distance competitor Jessica
Foschi, a punishment that would allow her to compete for a 1996 Olympic
berth next March.
World governing body FINA's rules mandate a two-year suspension and
Carol Zaleski, US Swimming's president, appealed for the 24-month
competition ban. A 20-member appeal panel will consider her request
next week.
"I have to think this is not going to sit well in the worldwide
swimming community," Zaleski said.
She is right. Don Talbot, Australia's national team coach, called for
an international protest against the US decision not to suspend Foschi.
The US stand has been criticized as hypocritical in light of a US push
for stiffer penalties on drug cheats in the wake of 19 positives since
1990 by China, coinciding with the nation's rise to dominance in
women's events.
John Leonard, executive director of the American Swimming Coaches
Association, was in Hong Kong speaking to 400 Asian coaches about the
need for more random drug testing. He was angry when told of the Foschi
ruling.
"If any other country did this we would be outraged. And I am
outraged," Leonard said. "This is the worst possible message we can
send. I am shocked and amazed by the decision. It's unbelievable and I
am embarassed by it."
A FINA congress in Brazil later this month will consider the imposition
of tougher testing on all competitors, including random unannounced
tests before the 1996 Olympics. But the Foschi case might undermine the
US-backed effort.
"I don't think this will hurt our effort in Rio," US Swimming executive
director Ray Essick said. "This decision is the opinion of a few
individuals and not the whole organization."
Should the appeal panel reject a two-year ban, FINA's almost-certain
ban could lead to a US court fight similar to that of Butch Reynolds in
athletics. That was the most recent case of a US governing body and its
global federation handing down different punishments over a drug
positive.
