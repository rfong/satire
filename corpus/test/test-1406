Kuwait Criticizes Israel For Touching Off Violence 
Two Kuwaiti newspapers today sharply criticized the Israeli government
for touching off violence and called on the Arab world to confront
Israeli attempts to torpedo the Mideast peace process.
In its front page editorial, the Arabic daily Al-Qabas said the
Israelis were taking an opportunity to commit massacres of the
Palestinian people and confiscate more land in addition to befouling
the holiest shrine of Islam.
Referring to the recent clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli
troops in the Palestinian self-ruled areas and Jerusalem, due to the
Israeli opening of a tunnel near the Al Aqsa Mosque, the paper said the
Israeli measures were leading the peace process to a dark tunnel.
It said: "we are sure that the international conscience, which was
shaken by the invasion of Lebanon, and massacres in Palestinian refugee
camps of Sabra and Shatila, Lebanon, in 1982, will activate in the face
of the new Likud massacres."
Another Arabic daily Al-Seyasseh expressed hope that the U.S. should
bear the responsibility for stopping the practice of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
It said, "Curbing Netanyahu now and dislodging him from acting
haphazardly and saving the Middle East peace process is the U.S.
responsibility."
The paper said U.S. President Bill Clinton should not delay this
responsibility even if he is occupied with other priorities.
Netanyahu is trying to escape from implementing the signed agreements
with the Palestinians, the paper added.
Al-Qabas asserted the responsibility of saving the Middle East peace
process and securing it from Jewish fundamentalism lies on the
international community topped by the United States as a co-sponsor of
the Middle East peace process.
Israel's decision Tuesday to open the archaeological tunnel near the
Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's Old City sparked fierce clashes between
the Palestinians and the Israelis, and the three-day violence killed 70
Palestinians and Israelis and wounded about 1,000 others.
The mosque is Muslim's third holiest shrine after Mecca and Medina in
Saudi Arabia. The Palestinians are afraid that the reopening of the
tunnel would damage the foundations of the holy site.
In a related development, Kuwaiti Minister of AWKAF and Islamic Affairs
Ali Fahad Al-Zumai and Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah had
denounced the Israeli decision to open the 500-meter tunnel.
The deadlocked Middle East peace process, which started a new chapter
in 1991 when all frontline Arab states and Israel gathered at the
Madrid conference, came to a critical point after Israel's right-wing
Likud Party headed by Netanyahu came to power in June this year.
