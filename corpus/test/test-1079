China still resents doping allegations 
China will try to repeat its excellent performances at Barcelona four
years ago when the Atlanta Olympics start later this month, but the
Chinsese remain annoyed by allegations that their athletes
systematically used drugs.
"While the United States, Germany and Russia are invincible, China, one
of some 10 members in the second echelon, hopes to finish atop in that
group in Atlanta," said Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) vice president
Yuan Weimin at a press conference to announce China's line-up for the
Olympiad.
"It's a tough challenge for the Chinese athletes since all the members
in the group are strong enough to grab some 10 gold medals in Atlanta,"
Yuan said, declining to specify the number of medals China hoped to
win.
At the 1992 Barcelona Games, China won 54 medals, including 16 golds,
finishing fourth behind Germany, which picked up 34 golds.
The Chinese will figure in 22 of the 26 events. They will be absent
from only baseball, hockey, pentathlon and equestrian events.
China will be counting on its female athletes on the 310-strong team --
the largest yet sent by China to the Olympics -- to keep its flag
flying high in Atlanta.
COC secretary general Wei Jizhong, meanwhile, has rejected continuing
allegations that Chinese athletes were systematically using
peformance-enhancing drugs.
Wei said no Chinese athlete had tested positive during competition
since early 1995, adding that China was being singled out over a
"worldwide problem."
"Good performances as well as bad performances provoke accusations by
some countries, which allow their athletes to compete after failing
doping tests," Wei said.
He singled out the United States and Australia, who have been at the
forefront of accusations against China, for allowing their female
swimmers Jessica Foschi and Samantha Riley to take part in national
championships despite failing dope tests.
"In order to achieve a clean Olympics, these countries should pay more
attention to their athletes," Wei said.
The Chinese line-up includes only individual athletes with a good
chance of making it to the finals in Atlanta.
China is pinning its hopes on events in which it has traditionally done
well, namely table tennis, diving, gymnastics and shooting, Yuan said.
An 80,000-yuan (9,600-dollar) bonus put up by the COC awaits all
athletes who strike gold.
Swimmers, judokas, badminton players and athletes are expected to make
a strong bid for top spots. China is also hoping to come up with some
surprises in rowing, archery, sailing, weightlifting and three women's
team sports; softball, volleyball and football, Yuan said.
