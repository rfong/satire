Ecuador says Israel confirms contract to deliver warplanes 
Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Galo Leoro said Friday that Israel has
confirmed it will fulfill a contract to deliver four fighter jets and
that they will be delivered by mid-February.
Israel will complete the contract as scheduled, Leoro said, disputing
reports that it would delay the delivery of the modified KFir warplanes
because of concern the military acquisition could complicate peace
negotiations between Ecuador and Peru.
The foreign minister declined to comment on those reports out of Tel
Aviv.
"What is certain is that the contract will be completed, because there
is nothing in it that will influence the military balance between the
two countries," he added.
In early January, the US embassy here denied a report that the United
States, reversing an earlier decision, had vetoed the Israeli jet sale
to Ecuador.
Under US law covering military exports, Israel must seek authorization
to export the Kfir fighters because they are built with US-made
engines.
Washington's approval of the sale prompted angry protests from
neighboring Peru.
Ecuador and Peru fought a border war last year. The United States is
one of the four guarantors of the peace treaty that ended the fighting.
