Martinez Trounces Hack to See Spain Through to Fed Cup Final
Conchita Martinez thrashed Sabine Hack without losing a game Sunday,
scoring the clinching point in Spain's 3-2 Fed Cup victory over Germany
that sent the two-time defending champion to the final.
Hack, who upset second-ranked Arantxa Sanchez Vicario on Saturday in
the opening singles, appeared sapped of energy and ideas. Martinez,
ranked third and who won her opening singles match Saturday against
Anke Huber, played nearly flawless tennis in scoring a 6-0, 6-0 victory
that won the best-of-five tie.
``Today, everything went my way,'' said Martinez. ``Everything I tried
went in.''
Hack, who had to have her left thigh bandaged during the game because
of an apparent muscle injury, admitted that Martinez was far superior.
``Conchita was laying far better than me and although I might have done
better without the injury, I don't think it would have influenced the
outcome,'' she said.
Sanchez Vicario got Spain off to a good start Sunday, beating Huber
6-3, 1-6, 6-2 to give her team a 2-1 lead.
Germany earned some consolation in the doubles. Huber and Claudia
Porwick defeated Maria Antonia Sanchez and Virginia Ruano 6-2, 6-2 for
the final point, but couldn't stop Spain from advancing to its fifth
straight Fed Cup final, where it will face either the United States or
France.
