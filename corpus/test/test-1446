S. African parliament rubberstamps findings on arms deal
The South African parliament's watchdog body on public spending Tuesday
rubberstamped a report by statutory agencies on the country's
multi-billion-dollar arms deal which clears the government of corruption.
The public accounts committee said it believed "there are therefore no
grounds to suggest that the government's contracting position is
flawed" and the deal, which will see South Africa buy arms from a
multitude of European manufacturers, should stand.
The position was pushed through by the African National Congress (ANC)
majority on the committee.
Opposition parties protested that the probe, which began in January,
pointed to serious flaws in the contracting process and have called for
further investigations but were outvoted.
The committee traditionally operates on a consensus basis, but the
ANC's Vincent Smith argued Tuesday that "our democracy does not call
for consensus" and said the ruling party would not debate the matter
further.
The investigation has found that while evidence suggested that
government officials had acted improperly, President Thabo Mbeki and
members of his cabinet were guilty of no wrongdoing.
Since the report was introduced on November 15, the department of
defence's chief of procurement has been suspended.
His brother, a director in two of the contracting companies -- the
French Thomson-CSF group (now Thales) and South African-based African
Defence Systems -- has been arrested with cabinet documents pertaining
to the deal in his possession.
And earlier this year, the chief whip of the ANC, Tony Yengeni, was
charged with corruption, fraud and perjury for allegedly accepting a
luxury vehicle from European Aeronautic Defence and Space (EADS)
corporation, which has a stake in a company supplying combat systems
for four corvettes the government has ordered from German Frigate.
Under the deal, South Africa will also buy three submarines from German
Frigate, nine fighter jets from Gripen, of Sweden, 12 trainer Hawk jets
from SAAB-British Aerospace and 30 light helicopters from the
Italian-based Augusta.
The probe into the arms deal was instigated in January at the
insistence of the public accounts committee following allegations of
widespread corruption in the deal.
But the ANC's handling of the process has sparked concerns that it was
stage-mananging the probe and that parliament's oversight role was
being compromised.
The adoption of the ANC-drafted report on Tuesday spells the end of the
parliamentary inquest into the arms deal, although the criminal
investigation will go ahead.
Raenette Taljaard of the official investigation Democratic Alliance,
which has branded the investigation a whitewash, said the party feared
that questions about the arms deal will now go unanswered.
"The public are the losers, they are footing the bill for a process
that was quite flawed. They are footing the bill for a deal that has no
cost ceiling."
The cost of the deal has doubled since it was announced and is now
estimated at some six billion dollars, but the investigators have
admitted that it cannot be fixed on any figure because of the
fluctuation of the rand.
Critics of the deal say that the money would be better spent on
uplifting South Africa's poor majority, and a peace activist has filed
a civil suit to have the deal overturned on this ground.
