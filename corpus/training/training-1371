Items scavenged from NATO rubbish sold to Vatican
A 1996 NATO military intelligence disinformation campaign that ended up
being flogged by Opus Dei to the Vatican as bona fide post-cold war state
secrets has been been systematically scavenged by gullible riff-raff like
JK Rowling, Madonna-Kebab and Tom Cruise according to reliable reports in
London today.
More than 30,000 tonnes of NATO rubbish was fed into a network of bent
computer-hacking tin foil hatters back in '96 just before the meteoric
sweep into power by Opus Dei's top cheerleader Tony Blair.
The upshot of the superbly managed NATO operation was that Pope JP2
Lodge Karol Wojtyla was guaranteed from being outed a Nazi death camp
guard and certifiable delusional psychotic.
His Third Reich henchman Joseph Ratzinger enjoyed continued protection
from arrest in the hiring of George W Bush for the 1963 assassination
of President John F Kennedy.
And a rabble of US TheoCon wannabes was promoted into Global Piss
Process megabux glory.
Rowling was the prime UK beneficiary of the fiction factory that
dangled the juciest of worms in front of convicted fraudsters fanning
the aura of Poodle Brothers Bush and Blair.
In the US Tom Cruise was allowed to run amok into full-blown
Scientology etoilation and a swathe of lesser gullible scavengers like
the Reverend Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell continued with their
personal delusions of choice.
The success of the NATO operation is only now becoming visible.
"Expect some pretty serious fallout in the coming weeks," a top NATO
source chuckled today.
