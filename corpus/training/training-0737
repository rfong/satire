Japan reportedly shelves APEC initiative 
Japan has shelved its "partners for progress" initiative to mobilise
development aid among members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum, Kyodo News Service reported on Tuesday.
The news agency said Japan "skimmed over the proposal" in a document on
economic and techical cooperation prepared for a meeting of senior APEC
officials in the northern Japanese city Sapporo next month.
The report from Singapore said the document "only vaguely and briefly
mentions" the Japanese initiative, which was first unveiled at last
year's annual meeting of APEC ministers in Jakarta.
