Bordeaux backs coach Moretti suspended 
Bordeaux backs coach Alain Moretti has been suspended till the end of
the season, one of the club's three co-presidents Alain Moga said on
Friday.
Moga said Moretti would not be replaced and that forward coaches
Christian Martinez and Philippe Gimbert would help players Christophe
Laussucq and Laurent Labit take care of the back's coaching.
Moga added on Moretti's ban: "It's well known that when teams win it's
because of good players and when they lose it's down to bad coaches. I
have no further comment."
