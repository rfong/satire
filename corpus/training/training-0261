Thai Police Demand Funding To Accommodate Illegal Lao Immigrants 
Police along the Laotian border said Saturday they were pressing the
Thai government for additional funding to cope with the growing number
of illegal immigrants jammed into their station.
Police Lt. Col. Boonjun Naunsai said in a telephone interview from
northeastern Thailand that his border station currently held 90 illegal
Laotian immigrants in two, wooden, fan-cooled rooms with only two
toilets to serve them, creating an overwhelming stench.
He said the station needed 10 million baht (dlrs 400,000) to improve
facilities to accommodate the constant stream of Laotians caught
crossing into Thailand to find work.
Most of the immigrants -- aged 17 to 40 -- are forced to wait at least
four months at the station while the Laotian government determines
whether they are indeed Laotian and should be returned to their
homeland.
