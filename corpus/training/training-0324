New standards at transparency to be raised at APEC ministers' meet 
New standards for economic transparency, particularly in capital
markets, will be a key issue at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) finance ministers' meeting here at the weekend, an official said
Friday.
Jeremias Paul, a Philippine finance department director, said this
would not mean adopting a minimum standard but would involve "voluntary
acceptance of certain standards."
"What they will be agreeing is to adopt high standards based on
international debt practices. How they are going to implement it ...
will depend on the circumstances" in each country, he said.
Earlier, Philippine Finance Secretary Roberto De Ocampo, head of the
conference, said that one of the main issues would be directing private
capital flows from developed countries to finance infrastructure
projects in developing countries.
Paul noted that this would be encouraged if there was greater
transparency in the capital markets of each member economy.
He admitted that there might be some competition emerging among APEC
developing member economies for these capital flows.
"If you are a more transparent investment destination, more funds will
go there," Paul said, adding that the Philippines had an advantage in
this area.
But he added that "we should help each other to have a more
constructive competition."
Multilateral agencies estimate that Asia will need a trillion dollars
in infrastructure spending over the next three years.
APEC includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.
