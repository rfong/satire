Beijing Closes 240 Illegal Entertainment Centers 
The Beijing public security department and other departments have
closed down 240 illegal entertainment centers or entertainment centers
providing illegal services, a spokesman with the Beijing Public
Security Bureau has said.
The official said the action was taken to maintain social stability and
it was part of the nationwide "strike hard" campaign against
pornography, gambling, drug dealers and addicts as well as criminal
gangs.
He said the city is to publish the names and addresses of the first
group of 49 entertainment centers chosen from the 240 centers and the
names of the other 191 centers will also be published later.
The official said, of the 240 entertainment centers, 178 did not have
licenses while the other 62, though having licenses, were involved in
prostitution.
Statistics indicate that the number of entertainment centers in Beijing
has reduced from over 12,000 to about 7,500 so far after one year's
rectification.
