Venezuelan Minister on President's Gulf Tour 
Venezuelan Minister of Energy and Mining Alvaro Silva Calderon, who
accompanied President Hugo Chavez on a just-ended two-nation tour of
the Gulf, said on Wednesday that the trip's main goal had been
achieved, the official news agency Venpres reported.
Calderon said the goal of Chavez's trip to Saudi Arabia was to come
closer to the world's important oil exporter and to ensure the price
stability amidst possible attempts to divide the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
In a show of unprecedented unity and strength of the organization,
decisions will always be made in consensus in efforts to benefit both
exporters and buyers and anticipate crises which could be caused by
problems in the world economy, he said.
He said the Arab leaders recognized that Chavez's job has been of
utmost importance for the integration of OPEC and expressed their hope
for the stability of their respective economies.
"Beyond price interests, we have common interests to develop our oil
companies, besides the industrial perspective and the stable relations
between our state-owned and private firms, which look forward to
opening non-oil commercial exchange possibilities, " he said.
There is a common interest in materializing bilateral investment
possibilities, as well as in exchanging experience in commerce, he
added.
Chavez traveled on February 16 to Saudi Arabia and Qatar, both OPEC
members, to seek consensus on the need to maintain fair oil prices in
the international market and to extend bilateral cooperation in other
areas.
OPEC ministers plan to meet in Vienna next month to decide whether to
further cut back on oil production.
