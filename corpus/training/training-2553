India, Pakistan secure access for individual service providers 
Negotiators in the World Trade Organization (WTO) will put the
finishing touches here Friday to an agreement that should allow more
liberal entry into some countries for persons providing services.
Key developing countries, such as India, Pakistan and Egypt, set the
conclusion of such an agreement as a pre-condition for endorsing the
interim WTO financial services deal that emerged here on Wednesday.
A senior Indian negotiator said Thursday that India was "obviously
happy" with the outcome of talks on this issue.
India was notably seeking easier access for its high-level computer
experts and other service providers in key Western countries.
A working party on what is known in WTO jargon as the "movement of
natural persons" will formally take note of special offers in this
respect tabled by 19 countries, including the 15 members of the
European Union (EU).
The offers will be attached to a formal protocol that was adopted by
the WTO Council for trade in services last Friday, and which will form
an international agreement open to all countries.
In addition to the EU countries, whose offers were presented on their
behalf by the EU Commission, the members that have tabled offers are
Australia, Canada, India, Norway and Switzerland.
EU sources said the EU countries had agreed to offer visas and work
permits to individual service providers for time periods that could
generally run to three months a year, as allowed under national
policies.
The sources said there was no uniform EU offer because EU harmonization
covers only EU citizens or EU-based companies while the negotiations
under the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) had a
bearing on nationals from all WTO member countries.
