Four freed British hostages arrive in London 
The four British hostages freed in a military operation last week after
being held for four months by Indonesian rebels arrived in London on
Sunday.
After their 17-hour flight, the young Cambridge University researchers,
looking pale and tired, were greeted by their families at Heathrow
airport before holding a press conference.
Daniel Start, 21, William Oates, 23, Annette van der Kolk, 21, and Anna
McIvor, 20, told of their joy in returning to Britain following their
ordeal in the jungles of Irian Jaya, a central mountainous area of
Indonesia.
Said Oates: "I'm looking forward to being back in time for a nice
Sunday lunch of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding."
Start added: "It's lovely to be back on a typical spring day -- cloudy
and wet, but not unlike the weather in the (Indonesian) forest."
Speaking of the army raid during which they escaped from the rebels of
the Free Papua Organization last Wednesday, Start said: "We are hurt
and in deep shock and sadness at such a visible and brutal death"
inflicted on two Indonesian friends. Eight rebels were also killed in
the operation.
The four Britons, three Indonesians and two Dutch fled their abductors
during the confusion that followed the murder of their two Indonesian
friends and met up with soldiers deployed in the military rescue
operation.
The rebels initially seized 26 hostages on January 8. They earlier
released 15 hostages and only 11 other hostages remained in their hands
by Wednesday.
Ex-hostage Adinda Sariswati described on state television on Friday how
the rebels killed her boyfriend and another man before she and the
other hostages could escape.
The surviving hostages were formally handed over to their families or
to their ambassadors on Friday.
The two dead victims were buried with military honors Friday, one here
and the other in Bandung, West Java.
