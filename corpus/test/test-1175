Japan's real GDP growth seen at around 1.0 pct: economic chief 
Japanese Economic Planning Agency director-general Isamu Miyazaki
forecast Wednesday real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the
year to March at around 1.0 percent, well down from the official target
of 2.8 percent.
He was speaking at a public lecture in Tokyo.
Miyazaki recently put his real GDP growth forecast for the current
fiscal year at 1.0-2.0 percent. GDP is a country's total output of
goods and services adjusted for foreign income.
He forecast that the ratio of the current account surplus to gross
national product (GNP) would fall closer to the 2.0 percent level in
either calendar 1996 or the financial year to March 1997, down from 2.6
percent in the year to March 1995.
GNP is a country's total output of goods and services.
