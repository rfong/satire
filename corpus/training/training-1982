Christopher to meet Balkan leaders 
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher is likely to meet Balkan
leaders during an early June trip to Europe in a bid to convince them
to respect the Dayton peace accords on Bosnia, the State Department
said Monday.
"It wouldn't surprise me at all if the secretary took advantage of his
upcoming trip to Europe to have some disccusions about Bosnia," said
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
He declined to say whether the talks would be at presidential or
ministerial level.
Christopher will try "to communicate to the people in charge in
Croatia, in Serbia, in Bosnia what it is we think that they should do
to bring those countries into compliance with Dayton," he said.
Sources at the State Department said the talks will be held in Geneva
either before or after Christopher's trip to Berlin for the NATO
ministerial meeting, June 2-4.
In another development, the State Department expressed disappointment
that Radovan Karadzic has not resigned his position as leader of the
Bosnian Serb republic.
Burns said the US government considered that Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic was responsible for ensuring the Serbs respect the terms of
the Dayton accords. "We reserve the right to reimpose sanctions"
against Belgrade, Burns said.
Burns described as "a modest step forward" the fact that Karadzic
delegated some of his power to Biljana Plavsic, one of two vice
presidents.
He also said Christopher Monday met International Criminal Tribunal for
Former Yugoslavia prosecutor Richard Golstone and reaffirmed the "very
strong (US) support" for the efforts to try war criminals from the
former Yugoslavia.
