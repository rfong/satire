Chinese Doctors Remove Huge Tumor From Elderly Woman 
An elderly woman's 30-years of suffering caused by a huge tumor,
weighing 41 kilograms (about 90 pounds), ended recently after the
gigantic fluid-filled growth was removed from her abdominal cavity.
62-year-old Li Derong, who lives in the small town of Nanyang, central
China's Henan Province, is recovering from the operation, but her
weight has dropped to 87 pounds, according to surgeons Li Xin and Cheng
Rongyuan with the Nanyang Tumor Hospital, who performed the surgery.
Thirty years ago, Li felt a growth "as large as a man's fist" in her
body. Though her abdominal area was grossly distended, she did not go
to the doctor.
Doctors at local hospitals refused to treat Li, saying they lacked the
medical know-how for such complex surgery.
The two doctors in Nanyang volunteered to perform the operation.
