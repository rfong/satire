Zimbabwe Government to Press Ahead With Reforms 
The Zimbabwean government today said it will press ahead with tough
economic reforms and solve a serious unemployment crisis which it
admitted threatens social and political stability.
Presenting the 1996/97 budget speech to parliament, Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa said the government is already preparing to launch the
second phase of the reforms, and consolidate on success achieved during
the first five year of the program, which ended last year.
He said growth will support employment creation by the private sector,
the lynch-pin of Zimbabwe's economic success.
Economic growth during the first phase of the reforms was
disappointing, averaging one percent against a target of five percent,
while population growth soared by 3.1 percent, according to the
minister.
The major setback, he said, is the failure by the government to reduce
the budget deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product, despite
pledges to donors to cut it from 10 percent to five percent of GDP by
the end of 1995.
In addition, huge parastatal losses and the resultant subsidies have
forced the government to increase borrowing on the domestic market,
further fueling inflationary pressures.
As the government prepares to launch the second phase of the reforms,
he said, it will redouble efforts to curb spending, and this will call
for further stringent measures to ensure ministries spend within their
means.
