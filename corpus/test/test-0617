Donors Back Nepal's Economic Policy: Minister 
A group of donors have voiced strong backing for Nepal's economic
development and pledged financial assistance for it in the 1996-97
fiscal year starting July, Nepali Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat
said today.
Mahat, who returned here Sunday from a meeting of the Nepal Aid Group
in Paris, told a press conference here that donor countries lauded the
liberal economic policy of the Nepali government.
They pledged a total of 993 million US dollars in assistance for Nepal
in the coming fiscal year at the four-day meeting organized by the
World Bank, he said.
The donor countries praised Kathmandu's efforts to restore fiscal
stability in the wake of the recent rapid expansions of public
expenditure in the country, said Mahat.
He said the group endorsed Nepal's economic reform program that
stresses reform in the fiscal and public sectors, including
privatization of state-owned enterprises, a tight monetary policy and
financial sector restructuring.
According to Mahat, the Nepali government recently adjusted market
prices of certain commodities, such as petroleum products and chemical
fertilizers, on the advice of the donors with a view to cutting down
government subsidies gradually.
The 13 donor countries and seven international financial agencies who
attended the Paris meeting agreed to meet again in about 18 months to
review the implementation of aid programs in Nepal, especially those in
the social field, Mahat added.
He said that although the donors recognized the importance of power
development in Nepal, most of the pledged assistance was not specified
for any project.
Mahat noted that Japan and the Asian Development Bank, both represented
at the Paris meeting, indicated intention to provide financial support
for the 144-megawatt Kali Gandaki hydropower project in eastern Nepal,
but Germany said it wanted to help finance another medium-capacity
power project.
