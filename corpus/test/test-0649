Venezuela Considers Unlikely Another OPEC Oil Cut Before June 
Venezuela Saturday considered it as unlikely that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will announce a new oil supply cut
before June.
As an OPEC oil supply cut comes into effect Sunday, Venezuelan Minister
of Energy and Mines Alvaro Calderon believed that international oil
prices will rise to a stable level before June and it is being planned
to hold a new meeting then to evaluate the effects of the oil supply
cut.
OPEC scheduled to cut the oil supply by more than 1 million barrels per
day starting from Sunday to curb the international oil price drop and
to keep oil prices at a range between 22 and 28 U.S. dollars per
barrel.
