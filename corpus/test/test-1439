Congress Adds 'All Your Base Are Belong To Us' Amendment To Bankruptcy Bill
Seeking to increase fiscal accountability among citizens who have no chance
to survive make their time, the House of Representatives added an "All Your
Base Are Belong To Us" amendment Monday to H.R. 333, the Bankruptcy Abuse
Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2001. "What you say!!!" shouted
the bill's sponsor, Rep. George Gekas (R-PA), following the amendment's
approval. "This bill will not only make debt-ridden Americans more
accountable, but it has the added benefit of taking off every 'zig' for
great justice."  Opponents of the amendment protested that it would
potentially set up U.S. the bomb.
