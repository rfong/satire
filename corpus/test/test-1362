Uganda Marks Independence Day 
A mammoth mass parade along with military march were held here today to
celebrate the 34th anniversary of Uganda's independence.
Addressing the nation to mark the Independence Day, President Yoweri
Museveni said, "We have now a democratic order because early this year
we elected the first president through universal presidential
elections."
"Members of parliament was also elected and we remain to elect local
goverment leaders," said the Ugandan president when presiding over a
huge celebration ceremony in the capital in which South African
President Nelson Mandela was present.
Speaking of the economic achievements in the country, Museveni said,
Uganda exported only nine kinds of products 10 years ago while at
present it exports 25 products.
He said the exports of coffee, Uganda's main foreign exchange earner,
accounted for 97 percent of value of all the exports in 1986 wen his
administration came to power, but now the figure has been reduced to
only 64 percent.
"In mining area, we have 20 new mining companies," he noted.
Dwelling in the field of industries in general, Museveni said, "we have
received in the last six years alone proposals for the setting up of
2,171 new projects. These are worth 2.8 billion U.S. Dollars. out of
all these, investments of 892 million Us Dollars have been put onto the
ground."
However, he frowned on corruption and called on people to use
constitution as a weapon to fight against it in the country.
On relations with foreign countries, Museveni said Uganda has been on
good terms with all countries except Sudan, and it is trying hard to
see how to mend fences with its northern neighbor.
Both sides accuse the other of backing its rebels.
Tens of thousands of people from all parts of the country as well as
diplomatic envoys accredited here attended the ceremony which lasted
for hours.
