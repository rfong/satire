NATO's expanded air strikes a mistake
The first commander of United Nations peacekeepers in Sarajevo said Tuesday
that NATO's expanded raids against Bosnian Serb positions were a strategic
error that would lead to more casualties.
Retired major general Louis MacKenzie, on a speaking tour, told
journalists that the initial bombings of Bosnian Serb heavy artillery
in the Sarajevo area were justified, but the expansion of those bombing
raids beyond the Sarajevo region was not.
He said the expanded bombing raids simply allowed the Bosnian
government to recapture land from the Serbs.
"It's quite clear," he said, "that the decision was made to give the
Bosnians an opportunity to take back their share.
"The targeting of areas that are now strategic objectives of the
Bosnian-Croat coalition indicates to me that there was a greater agenda
afoot here and that was to permit the Bosnian-Croatian coalition to
take over a significant degree of territory."
And that, said MacKenzie who commanded the UN forces in Sarajevo in
1992, amounted to NATO interference in an internal conflict.
"Unfortunately," he added, "taking sides in the conflict has resulted
in a new side now having the upper hand and the slaughter will
continue."
