Mitsubishi to boost energy-efficient engine production capacity 
Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said Monday it would raise monthly
production capacity of its gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines from
7,000 to 20,000 units by the end of this year.
The Japanese car maker said it would install the energy-efficient
engines in its recreational vehicle models, but did not specify the
type of models.
Mitsubishi also said it planned to supply the engines to small cars to
be made at Netherlands Car BV (NedCar), a joint venture between
Mitsubishi Motors and Volvo.
