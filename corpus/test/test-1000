Singapore car sales drop 15 percent in first half 
New car sales in Singapore, one of the costliest places in the world to
own an automobile, slumped 15 percent in the six months to June, partly
the result of a dismal stock market and official curbs.
Unaudited figures released by the Motor Traders' Association showed
15,215 car sales registred in the first half, down from 17,798 in
January-June last year.
Investment house Vickers Ballas said in a commentary the government
decision to keep down the number of certificates of entitlement
required to buy a new car was the main reason for the drop.
"Other factors affecting the passenger car market include the full
effect of the financing curbs introduced in the second half of 1995,
the plunge in resale value and the 'negative wealth effect' generated
by the dismal stock market," it said.
