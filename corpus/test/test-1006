New Zealand facing a big task in Pakistan Test 
A frail New Zealand batting line-up faces a big task on the fourth day
of their one-off cricket Test against Pakistan here Monday.
Having bowled Pakistan out for 434 in their second innings shortly
before lunch, New Zealand require 357 to win in the remaining five
sessions of the match.
At lunch, the Kiwis were one without loss from four overs, Craig
Spearman on one and Bryan Young yet to score.
Pakistan's last three wickets added a further 65 runs in the morning
session, staving off New Zealand's bid for a quick end to the innings.
Mushtaq Ahmed and Waqar Younis were the chief stumbling blocks for the
New Zealand bowlers.
They added a gritty 41 in 57 minutes for the ninth wicket, Mushtaq
reaching 24 and Younis going on to his highest test score, 34, before
being last man out.
The day began well for the Kiwis when Pakistan captain Wasim Akram was
caught at first slip for 19 in the fourth over of the day.
However, Mushtaq and Younis both showed a keen eye for the scoring
opportunity and neither gave the Kiwi attack a chance.
Eventually slow medium Gavin Larsen finished off the innings.
Mushtaq mis-timed a shot to the on side, the ball flying off the
leading edge of his bat for wicketkeeper Lee Germon to take his fourth
catch of the innings.
Then Younis went leg before wicket, giving Larsen two for 58 from 29
overs.
The most successful New Zealand bowler was Chris Cairns with three for
114, while Danny Morrison and Dion Nash took two wickets apiece and
offspinner Dipak Patel one.
