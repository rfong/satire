filiale of Exxon/Mobil, said over the weekend that his company has
succeeded in discovering six good-performing oil wells in the Block 15,
the waters where the Esso and Mobil is operating.
Media here Monday quoted Docherty as saying that Esso and Mobil is
committed to continuing its development plans in Angola.
He said that his company will operate in four oil blocks and
participate in the exploration activities in seven others.
Docherty also said that Esso and Mobil, successor of the former Esso in
Angola, will meet the commitments made by Esso in Angola before the
merging of the Exxon and Mobil last December.
He said that Esso and Mobil has very good relations with the Angolan
government officials and the state-owned oil company Sonangol.
