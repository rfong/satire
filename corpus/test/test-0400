BT, MCI seek US approval of merger plans 
Communications giants MCI and British Telecom announced Tuesday they
had sought US approval for a multi-billion dollar merger, which they
said would spur international competition and mean lower prices for US
consumers.
The firms said they had presented their case to the US Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) for authorization to form a new,
combined company, known as Concert.
The deal was unveiled November 3 with an announcement that BT, which
already has a 20 percent stake in MCI, would acquire the remaining 80
percent in the US firm in a transaction valued at 20 billion dollars.
The new entity was expected to have annual sales of more than 40
billion dollars from communications services provided to consumers and
businesses. It would be the second largest telecommunications group in
the world after AT and T of the United States.
In arguments submitted to the FCC, the companies said that as a result
of the merger, MCI would speed up its entrance into the local telephone
market in the United States.
"Increased competition in this market will offer American consumers
choice in the selection of their local phone carrier for the first
time, at lower prices and with a greater array of integrated
communication services."
In addition BT and MCI maintained that the merger would "advance the
opening of foreign markets to telecommunications competition," with US
consumers eligible for "new and enhanced services and more competitive
international telephone rates."
The application also held that the British telecommunications market
had been substantially deregulated and thus met FCC requirements for
the participation of foreign firms in US corporations.
If approved, the merger would mark the first time full access to the US
telecommunications sector had been granted to a foreign firm.
The British market, according to BT and MCI, will soon allow US
carriers to offer international services to British consumers. They
said the domestic market was already fully open to US providers and
contended that Britain provides an effective regulatory framework as
well as safeguards against anti-competitive practices.
In June 1993 BT invested 4.3 billion dollars to take a 20 percent stake
in MCI. As part of the deal, the companies formed a joint venture, also
known as Concert, to provide communications services to multinational
corporations.
That arrangement won the approval of the FCC, Britain's Office of Fair
Trading and the executive commission of the European Union.
The commission is also expected to investigate the latest merger
proposal.
