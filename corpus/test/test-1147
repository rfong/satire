Rabin accuses Syria of violating accords 
Syria has broken its word after agreeing to follow-up meetings between
military officers and thereby slowed peace negotiations, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin charged Monday.
"There is no freeze in the negotiations but a slowing down," Rabin told
parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee.
He explained that Syria had agreed to three stages in talks on security
arrangements to accompany an Israeli withdrawal on the Golna Heights:
-- a meeting between chiefs of staff in Washington June 27 and June 28
-- a Middle East shuttle by a US envoy last week
-- and a meeting betwen military officers, which has failed to
materialize
"Unfortunately the Americans have told me the Syrians no longer see any
need to have the officers negotiate," Rabin said.
"They prefer talks between ambassadors. It's a violation of something
that the Syrians and ourselves agreed. We agreed on a package deal
which has been violated.
"It's a procedural question. But if we violate procedures who is to
guarantee there will not be other violations," he asked.
Despite the accusations, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said
Sunday that talks at ambassador level would resume in a week or two.
Rabin went on to say: "I have no doubt that the Syrian behaviour comes
from the fact that we asked for early warning stations on the Golan."
He raised fears of a flare-up in violence along the border with
Lebanon.
"I think that the situation of the negotiations will have an effect on
the Lebanon border," he said, adding, "I hope that nothing will
happen."
Official Syrian radio on Monday charged that early warning stations
would be used for spying after a withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
The two countries blamed each other at the weekend after US envoy
Dennis Ross failed to persuade them to set a new date for talks in
Washington.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres has spoken of a "crisis" in the
peace moves.
