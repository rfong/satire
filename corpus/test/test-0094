Berlusconi in 'I quit' shock
Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has announced his sudden
resignation - to spend more time with his television channels and
football team.
In a recorded speech broadcast on his own TV channel Mediaset, Mr
Berlusconi shocked the nation by admitting that the strains of
political life were getting in the way of the things dearest to his
heart.
"Politics was only ever really a hobby for me, but now it's got on top
of things and I've come to the stage where I have to say enough is
enough," a tired and clearly emotional Mr Berlusconi told record TV
audiences. "I felt it was taking over from the simple things in life
like coming home at the end of the day, tucking my Mediaset chief
executives up in bed and reading them a bedtime story."
He spoke of his frustration at trying to balance the demands of being
the leader of a country with what he described as paternal duties'.
"At the end of the day I'm a simple family man," he told the nation. "I
was worried that if I didn't take a hold of the situation soon, it
could eventually spiral out of control and I would end up losing my
loving and faithful multi-media network, newspaper publishing empire,
construction companies and chain of supermarkets."
Mr Berlusconi also praised the football club AC Milan, which he hopes
to buy back in the near future. He was forced to divest the club on
becoming prime minister because of the country's strict laws on
conflicts of interest.
"She's been a rock and stayed with me through good times and bad," he
said. "I'll never forget what she did for me this year, winning the
European Champion's League, despite the fact I was often away from the
stadium up to my eyes in work at the office."
The news has prompted tearful scenes all over Italy. In Rome a huge
crowd of supporters massed outside the Parliament building and burst
into a tearful rendition of KC and the Sunshine Band's classic 70s hit
Don't Go.'
However, Mr Berlusconi has allayed fears that his resignation could see
him drift out of public life for good.
"Don't worry, you haven't seen the last of me," he promised a news
conference. "I can't reveal anything yet but let's just say, I'm
working on something."
Speculation is mounting that Mr Berlusconi is hoping to launch a
chatshow in the New Year if he can persuade the Mediaset board of
directors that he has the nous to become a TV presenter.
