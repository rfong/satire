France, Morocco Welcome Resumption of Israel-Palestinian Talks 
France and Morocco welcomed on Monday the resumption of peace talks
between Israel and Palestinians which are due to start on Tuesday in
Washington.
During their talks at the Elysee presidential palace, French President
Jacques Chirac and visiting Moroccan King Mohammed VI said that the
resumption of the talks are a ``positive element.''
They also pointed out that the perspective of a resumption of the talks
between Israel and Syrian still remains greatly uncertain, said
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
``But they also consider it important that, apart from this single
resumption of talks, the hopes for peace which came with the arrival of
the new Israeli government should not be turned down,'' she said.
The two heads of state said that the peace talks between Syria and
Israel should also move forward in a concrete way, the spokeswoman
added.
Chirac again reaffirmed France's commitment to the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon and said that France
is ready to help Lebanon guarantee these ``on the spot'' once it signs
a peace agreement with Israel.
