Central Government Helps Gansu to Eliminate Poverty 
China's central government has in the past 16 years allocated 880
million yuan to help 58 counties in the country's northwest Gansu
Province to eliminate poverty.
Over 522 million yuan was used to build 10,000 infrastructure projects,
including water conservancy projects, reservoirs and more irrigated
areas.
Construction of drinking water systems have helped 2.64 million farmers
and 1.65 million animals to have access to clean water.
With the completion of a 5,300-km highway system and 700 bridges, 96
percent of the remote poor townships now have access to the national
road network.
The state has assisted impoverished counties to set up 3,249 rural
enterprises, which have created new jobs for 1.2 million rural people.
Government funds have also been used to popularize agro-science, build
clinics and repair dangerous school buildings.
As a result of the initiatives, grain output from poor counties has
increased from 4.02 billion kg in 1980 to 6.39 billion kg in 1995. The
per capita annual income of farmers rose in the same period from 68
yuan to 884 yuan.
