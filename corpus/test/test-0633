France lifts border controls with Spain and Germany 
France has decided to lift its border controls with Spain and Germany,
in line with the Schengen agreement on free movement of persons, but
will maintain controls with the Benelux countries, the Ministry of
European Affairs said here on Monday.
The ministry said border checks with Belgium, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands would be maintained pending introduction of "operational
solutions" to fight drug trafficking.
