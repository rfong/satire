US Envoy Rules out US Policy Change in Mideast 
Richard Jones, ambassador of the United States to Lebanon, ruled out
here today a change of his country's policy in the Middle East after
the re-election of President Bill Clinton.
He said that the U.S. administration is making big efforts in finding a
"common field" for a resumption of the peace process between Israel on
the one side and Lebanon and Syria on the other.
At the end of a meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz,
the U.S. diplomat said that the peace talks on the Lebanese and Syrian
tracks will continue, noting that Washington will enhance its efforts
following the U.S. general elections.
Jones told reporters that the U.S. administration had been seeking ways
for the resumption of the two tracks and currently "we are
concentrating on the problem of an Israeli redeployment from Hebron."
"These negotiations will resume soon," the U.S. envoy emphasized.
Answering a question on whether the U.S. will change its policy in the
Middle East after the general elections, Jones said the U.S. has taken
a "balanced and firm policy and we will continue following this policy
in the region."
He said that the events in the region have been affecting the U.S.
policy, but "I don't expect a sharp change in our policy and we are
working with patience and we will continue to do so."
The U.S. diplomat also ruled out an escalation of tension in south
Lebanon.
