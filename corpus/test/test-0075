Greece to Send More Soldiers to Kosovo
Greece has decided to send more soldiers
to Kosovo to increase the strength of the Greek military contingent
serving in the region.
Confirming this at a press briefing Thursday, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that Greece would send another infantry
unit to Kosovo.
The new Greek battalion, which is now based in the northern Greek city
of Thessaloniki, will be stationed in the new installations of the
Rigas Fereos army camp near Urosevac.
Greece has a strong battalion of 1,200 men participating in the
NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in Kosovo, and most of the
Greek soldiers have been stationed in southern Kosovo.
