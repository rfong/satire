Jailed Banker Says Government Leaders Tried to Kill Him 
A banker arrested for alleged corruption that led to the collapse of
Latvia's largest bank has accused government leaders of trying to kill
him.
Alexander Lavent, who was chief supervisor at the troubled Banka
Baltija until its collapse in May, said there was a conspiracy to kill
him by prescribing him the wrong medication.
Latvian Prime Minister Maris Gailis and Central Bank president Einars
Repse were among the conspirators named by Lavent, who is in a prison
hospital with a heart ailment.
The imprisoned bank supervisor made the accusations in a letter Tuesday
to Latvia's largest right-wing newspaper, Neatkariga Rita Avize.
Lavent didn't clarify why the Latvian leaders wanted him dead.
The bank leader was charged a month ago with emptying bank coffers for
personal gain and running a pyramid scheme. He has denied the charges.
Analysts estimate total losses at Banka Baltija at about dlrs 400
million, equivalent to almost half the former Soviet republic's
national budget.
A fifth of Latvians had money in now-frozen Baltija accounts.
Economists say the financial crisis could slow growth in Latvia, whose
radical market reforms have spurred a business boom in recent years.
