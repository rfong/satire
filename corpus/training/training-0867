Swedish IFOR soldiers hurt in mine blasts; US vehicle also hit 
Three Swedish soldiers were injured, one seriously, when they hit
landmines in the north-east of Bosnia-Hercegovina on Sunday, an IFOR
spokesman said.
He said a US armoured vehicle also hit a mine, but there were no
casualties.
The Swedish casualties occurred 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the west of
the town of Maglaj, in a planned demarcation zone between Bosnian
government and Bosnian-Serb sectors, said the spokesman, Major Herve
Gourmelon.
He did not say how the casualties occurred or whether the troops,
serving with the Nordic battalion, were in vehicles or on foot. The
Nordic troops are serving in the US sector of Bosnia, where Maglaj is
located.
The IFOR spokesman said the US incident occurred near the town of
Gradacac, also in the north-east. There were no further details.
