Swazi PM arrives as Taiwan prepares to divert business from SAfrica 
The Prime Minister of Swaziland arrived in Taiwan for a week of talks
Wednesday, as Taipei considers the future of its billion dollar plus
investments in neighbouring South Africa.
Taipei has made no secret that it is ready to help its enterprises in
South Africa relocate to Swaziland as Pretoria prepares to cut
diplomatic ties from the end of the year.
But the move hinges on Swaziland improving its investment climate and
signing an investment guarantee agreement with Taiwan.
Against that backdrop, Swazi premier Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini arrived
in Taipei to be greeted by Foreign Minister John Chang, African affairs
director Timothy Yang and protocol director John Feng.
During his eight days in the nationalist island, Dlamini is scheduled
to meet President Lee Teng-hui, Vice President and Premier Lien Chan
and Council of Agriculture chairman Tjiu Mau-ying.
Simultaneously, a Taiwan-Swaziland economic technical conference is
being held in Taipei this week, with the signing of a cooperation
agreement expected when the forum ends on Thursday.
At stake for Swaziland is a large slice of Taiwan's South African
investments which have a current combined worth of 1.5 billion US
dollars.
"Since Taipei does not have an investment guarantee agreement with
Pretoria, the 620 Taiwan-invested businesses in South Africa may be
jeopardized with the suspension of diplomatic ties," a foreign ministry
official warned.
Dlamini has twice visited the island as Swaziland's finance minister,
in 1985 and 1991 separately.
Swaziland is one of 30 countries maintaining diplomatic relations with
Taiwan.
Taiwan's Tuntex Group, already investing four million dollars on a
textile factory in Swaziland, has plans to build a 350 million power
plant in the kingdom.
The textile factory will create 1,200 job opportunities when it starts
operating at the end of 1997.
