Swiss Police Crack International Drug Ring 
In what is described as the biggest success achieved in Europe so far
against smugglers of illegal "Thai pills," Swiss police have arrested
102 people in a sweeping drug enforcement operation, Swiss Radio
International ( SRI) reported Tuesday.
Authorities also seized 450,000 Thai pills, which resemble the drug
ecstasy, but are cheaper and have an effect that lasts longer up to
eight hours. Police said the high risk of dependence, and the damaging
physical and psychological effects make the Thai pills extremely
dangerous.
SRI reported that the long-planned international enforcement operation
began in 1999, and involved the police forces of 16 cantons in
Switzerland as well as two federal agencies the Federal Office of
Police and the Federal Customs Administration. Police in Germany,
Austria, Liechtenstein and Thailand also cooperated in the
investigation.
At a news conference in Bern on Tuesday, police showed how items such
as stuffed animals, clothing, food, musical instruments, cosmetics or
soap powder were used to conceal the pills during shipment.
Police said the drug ring was using Switzerland as a test market for
the potent Thai pills as well as a distribution point for shipments to
neighboring countries. Switzerland was an ideal test market because of
its large Asian community, its location in the middle of Europe and the
short distances to its borders, police said.
