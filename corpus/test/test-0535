Cards out for rugby World Cup referees 
Rugby World Cup referees will not use yellow and red cards for warnings
or sendings-off, the International Board announced Tuesday.
But players caught punching, kicking and butting will miss the rest of
the tournament, which starts in South Africa next month.
The minimum recommended suspension for a player sent off is 30 days for
punching and 60 for kicking and butting.
Sir Ewart Bell, chairman of Rugby World Cup, announcing the officials
for the World Cup, said: "I was expecting that the card system would be
used but the International Board has not agreed to the general adoption
of the experiment.
"The IB has not made up its mind and wants further tests. We did not
think the Rugby World Cup was the place to experiment."
Opposing teams and officials have 24 hours to cite players guilty of
foul play missed by the referee or touch-judges. The case will be heard
by a member of the executive council of the IB. Guilty players will be
sent home.
The board announced officials for the first two rounds. Welshman Derek
Bevan, who refereed the last World Cup final between Australia and
England, will be in charge when South Africa meet Australia in the
opening match in Cape Town on May 25.
Referees have so far only been appointed for the opening two rounds of
games.
Scotland's Jim Fleming referees England's match against Argentina on
May 27 and Ireland's Stephen Hilditch is in charge when they play the
Italians on May 31.
Wales will have Argentina's Ephraim Sklar in charge when they open
against Japan and England's Ed Morrison takes control of Wales v New
Zealand.
Scotland's opening fixture against Ivory Coast will be taken by Felise
Vito, of Western Samoa, and the Scots' game against Tonga is to be
refereed by Australian Barry Leask.
Ireland have the other Australian referee, Wayne Erickson, when they
start against New Zealand and their match against Japan will be
controlled by South African Stef Neethling.
There are two referees from countries who have not qualified -- Moon
Soo Han, of Korea, and Inaki Atorrasagasti, from Spain.
