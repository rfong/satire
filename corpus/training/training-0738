UNHCR Expects Greater Role in Refugee Issue 
Officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said here
Friday that they had not been informed of a decision by Thailand to
allow them to help solve the Karen refugee issue.
Earlier reports said Thailand would allow the UNHCR to play a greater
role in handling the Karen refugees on the Thai-Myanmar border.
The reports quoted Thai Supreme Commander General Mongkol Ampornpisit
as saying that "the UNHCR will work jointly with Thailand in relocating
the refugees to safer areas further inside Thailand's borders."
He said the UNHCR would be allowed to work with the Thai military to
take better care of the refugees and ensure more security and safety
for the refugees.
Plans are reportedly underway to combine and relocate the camps aimed
at facilitating closer supervision and providing more security and
safety for the refugees.
The UNHCR has been seeking greater access to the refugee camps which
shelter some 90,000 Karen refugees who escaped to Thailand after being
attacked by their rival Karen Buddhist army.
