Three dead as heavy rains, floods, hit Spain 
Three people were killed in separate parts of Spain on Tuesday as heavy
rains and gale force winds swept across the country, local authorities
said.
Officials said a five-year-old girl drowned when a wave of mud engulfed
the house where she was playing at Cabezuela del Valle in the
southwestern region of Extremadura. Her 10-year-old cousin was
seriously injured.
A 65-year-old woman was crushed by a collapsing wall as floodwaters up
to two metres (six feet) deep surged through the village of Montoro,
near Cordoba.
Later, authorities said a 49-year-old man died when his four wheel
drive vehicle was crushed by a tree which fell in gale force winds near
Avila, central Spain.
The meteorological service warned of continuing heavy rains in southern
regions, which have suffered from drought for several years.
Elsewhere the crews of two trawlers were rescued after their vessels
sank off the coast of Galicia, in the north west of the country.
In the south and around Burgos, northern Spain many minor roads were
reported to be impassable.
