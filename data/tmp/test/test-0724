While/IN Tokyo/NNP 's/POS population/NN has/VBZ remained/VBN stable/JJ at/IN around/RB 11/CD million/CD for/IN several/JJ years/NNS ,/, the/DT National/NNP Land/NNP Agency/NNP estimates/VBZ that/IN congestion/NN will/MD only/RB get/VB worse/JJR if/IN the/DT city/NN retains/VBZ its/PRP$ current/JJ structure/NN ./.
