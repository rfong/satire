hke Rubiera Wins 19th Stage at Tour of Italy Cycling 
Spaniard rider Jose Luis Rubiera went it alone in the mountains on
Thursday to take the 19th stage of the Tour of Italy as leader Ivan
Gotti recovered from Wednesday's slip to extend his advantage overall
to more than 90 seconds with two stages left.
Gotti, who lost 14 seconds to main rival Pavel Tonkov in Wednesday's
time-trial, gained 55 seconds on the Russian over Thursday's six hill
climbs covering 222 kilometres in the Dolomites, stretching his overall
lead to one minute and 32 seconds.
But the day belonged to 24-year-old Rubiera. The Spaniard joined a
large breakway after the second hill before producing a sustained surge
that the other riders simply couldn't live with.
He crossed the line over three minutes in front of a group of four --
the Italian trio of Gotti, Roberto Conti and Giuseppe Guerini, and
Colombian Jose Jaime Chepe Gonzalez Pico.
Tonkov, who fell on the fourth hill, lost touch with Gotti and Guerini
after they attacked 55km from the finish. Guerini's performance lifted
him to third overall.
Frenchman Luc Leblanc and Kazakhstan's Alexandre Shefer, third and
fourth overall at the start, pulled out during the stage, both
evidently suffering from their falls the previous day.
