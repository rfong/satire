Seles reaches final against Hingis
Fourth seed Monica Seles breezed past 11th seed Barbara Paulus of Austria
6-1, 6-0, here Thursday to reach a showdown final against Martina Hingis at
the WTA Lipton Championships.
Hingis beat Seles 6-2, 6-0, last November in an indoor final at Oakland
in their only prior meeting. But Seles was hampered by an injured
shoulder that caused her to quit the WTA Championships in New York two
weeks later.
Seles has been off the past four months with a broken right ringfinger
and made her 1997 debut here, going 5-0 so far.
Hingis has won four titles this year, including the Australian Open for
her first Grand Slam crown. Hingis is 28-0 overall in 1997 and 25-0 in
WTA and Fed Cup competition.
