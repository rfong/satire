Croatia Says Some Peacekeepers Can Stay 
The president of Croatia on Sunday agreed to let a scaled-down U.N.
peacekeeping force remain as a buffer between his troops and Serb
fighters.
The announcement, made as world leaders gathered at the U.N.'s poverty
summit in Copenhagen, reduces fears that the Balkans were on the verge
of erupting into fighting even more bloody than the last 3 1-2 years of
war.
President Franjo Tudjman previously had said the 12,000-man U.N. force
would have to leave once its madate expired at the end of March. But he
said Sunday that he envisions about 5,000 staying after a new mandate
is worked out with the U.N. Security Council.
The troops' duties and redeployment were still up to negotiations
between Croatia and the United Nations, Tudjman said. He said there was
no deadline for a new agreement, ``but we hope it could be in the near
future.''
The agreement came after months of diplomatic pleas and pressure, from
the United States and others. Tudjman made his announcement in a joint
news conference with Vice President Al Gore.
The withdrawal order raised the prospect of renewed fighting in
Croatia, which had been largely peaceful since a six-month war in 1991,
and of inflaming neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, where a shaky
four-month truce is set to end May 1.
``The departure of U.N. presence from the scene now would lead to
full-scale war between Croatian Serbs and government forces,'' Gore
said.
Tudjman had complained that the peacekeeping force had done nothing
toward reintegrating Serb-held territory into Croatia and that the
force had only preserved the status quo.
