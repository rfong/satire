Croatian Serbs Reported Withdrawing From Bihac Pocket 
The new four-month truce across Bosnia took deeper hold Tuesday with
U.N. officials reporting that Croatian Serbs who had threatened to
unravel the truce were withdrawing to their own territory.
The forces from Serb-held Croatia had threatened the truce by fighting
on in northwestern Bosnia. They intervened in the Bihac pocket, which
borders their territory in Croatia, in November when Bosnian Serbs and
rebel Muslims launched a fierce offensive against government troops in
the area.
The Croatian Serbs were supposed to withdraw under the four-month truce
agreed at the weekend between the Bosnian government and Bosnian Serbs.
But the Croatian Serbs were not a direct party to that accord, which
specifically demanded the withdrawal of ``foreign forces.''
U.N. spokesman Michael Williams told reporters in Zagreb that fighting
``has subsided quite significantly'' in the Bihac pocket, and that
Croatian Serb forces were withdrawing.
``It does seem to be a substantial withdrawal ... (but) we can't say
whether their withdrawal is completed,'' he added.
The report of their pullout followed talks between U.N. and Croatian
Serb leaders on Monday.
The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, who
has shuttled around the republic trying to maintain the momentum for
peace, went to Gornji Vakuf in central Bosnia Tuesday to try and cement
the cease-fre there.
He was attending the first meeting of a regional commission of
government and Serb commanders who are to discuss withdrawal of troops
and deployment of U.N. forces to police the cease-fire, particularly
around nearby Donji Vakuf, where the Serbs are besieged on three sides
by government forces.
Another U.N. spokesman in Zagreb, who asked not to be identified, said
most of the 20 cease-fire violations countrywide Monday were around
Bihac. Twelve were attributed to Bosnian Serbs, and eight to government
forces, he said.
In Bihac, he said, small arms fire and 32 shell impacts were reported
in and around Velika Kladusa, the stronghold of renegade Muslim leader
Fikret Abdic, whose troops recaptured most of it from Bosnian
government troops in mid-December.
The Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency, quoting Abdic's radio, claimed
government forces were attacking Abdic's men and that about 100
government soldiers had defected to Abdic.
Croatia's state news agency HINA reported Tuesday on an advance of
Bosnian Croat troops in west-central Bosnia, but it was not clear if
that took place before or after Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak
signed the latest U.N.-brokered truce on Monday.
HINA said Bosnian Croat troops took control of ``the last important
Serb stronghold'' in the region, Crni Lug hill, some 45 kilometers
(nearly 30 miles) northwest of Livno and 20 kilometers (12.5 miles)
west of Glamoc, two recent hot spots of Croat-Serb fighting.
Neither the Tanjug nor HINA reports could be independently confirmed.
The four-month truce pact signed Saturday by the Bosnian government and
Bosnian Serbs calls for separation of troops, free movement of U.N. aid
and personnel as well as the opening of access roads north and south of
Sarajevo.
But implementation on the ground seemed slow and laborious.
In Sarajevo, U.N. officials said Croatian Serbs and Abdic's men were
still restricting U.N. movement around Bihac.
Bosnian Serbs also still have not given permission for evacuaton of 35
chronically ill people out of the eastern Muslim enclave of Gorazde.
Permission was sought on Christmas Day, and two of the sick already
have died, U.N. relief officials said.
Supplies for U.N. personnel and the civilian population in the Bihac
area also continued to be a problem.
Williams said the U.N. received clearance from Croatian Serbs Tuesday
for one substantial resupply convoy for the Bangladeshi battalion in
Bihac, who have almost no fuel and thus cannot patrol any truce.
In Sarajevo, a total of 31 flights were scheduled to land at the
airport, which was reopened after an Il-76 transport plane, immobile
after a crash landing, was removed from the runway.
