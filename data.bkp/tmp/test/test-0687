As/IN James/NNP Wyatt/NNP and/CC Gerard/NNP Plunkett/NNP told/VBD it/PRP ,/, their/PRP$ lives/NNS changed/VBD forever/RB one/CD night/NN nearly/RB nine/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, when/WRB a/DT man/NN shot/VBD and/CC seriously/RB wounded/VBN them/PRP after/IN a/DT traffic/NN dispute/NN ./.

He/PRP turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB an/DT off-duty/JJ New/NNP York/NNP state/NN correction/NN officer/NN ./.

As/IN the/DT officer/NN ,/, Kenneth/NNP Robinson/NNP ,/, told/VBD it/PRP ,/, his/PRP$ life/NN was/VBD in/IN danger/NN when/WRB he/PRP fired/VBD at/IN Wyatt/NNP and/CC Plunkett/NNP ,/, who/WP were/VBD hurling/VBG punches/NNS and/CC racial/JJ slurs/NNS at/IN him/PRP ./.

Wyatt/NNP and/CC Plunkett/NNP are/VBP white/JJ ,/, and/CC Robinson/NNP is/VBZ black/JJ ./.

After/IN years/NNS of/IN courtroom/NN battles/NNS that/WDT may/MD not/RB be/VB over/RP yet/RB ,/, the/DT state/NN has/VBZ been/VBN held/VBN responsible/JJ for/IN Robinson/NNP 's/POS actions/NNS ,/, even/RB though/IN he/PRP was/VBD off/IN duty/NN ,/, and/CC last/JJ week/NN a/DT judge/NN ordered/VBD it/PRP to/TO pay/VB more/JJR than/IN $/$ 6/CD million/CD to/TO the/DT men/NNS he/PRP shot/VBD ./.

The/DT judge/NN ,/, Albert/NNP Blinder/NNP of/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Claims/NNS in/IN Manhattan/NNP ,/, said/VBD Wyatt/NNP should/MD get/VB just/RB over/IN $/$ 4/CD million/CD and/CC Plunkett/VB slightly/RB more/JJR than/IN $/$ 2/CD million/CD ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ virtually/RB certain/JJ that/IN the/DT state/NN will/MD consider/VB appealing/VBG the/DT ruling/NN ./.

A/DT spokesman/NN for/IN Attorney/NNP General/NNP Dennis/NNP Vacco/NNP ,/, in/IN office/NN less/JJR than/IN three/CD weeks/NNS ,/, said/VBD last/JJ week/NN that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ not/RB had/VBN time/NN to/TO study/VB the/DT case/NN ./.

The/DT case/NN arises/VBZ from/IN a/DT seemingly/RB minor/JJ and/CC common/JJ kind/NN of/IN traffic/NN confrontation/NN ./.

On/IN March/NNP 21/CD ,/, 1986/CD ,/, Wyatt/NNP ,/, Plunkett/NNP and/CC Plunkett/NNP 's/POS wife/NN had/VBD dinner/NN together/RB and/CC made/VBD plans/NNS to/TO go/VB to/TO a/DT basketball/NN game/NN ./.

Wyatt/NN ,/, who/WP lived/VBD in/IN the/DT Inwood/NNP section/NN of/IN Manhattan/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT Plunketts/NNPS ,/, who/WP lived/VBD in/IN the/DT Riverdale/NNP section/NN of/IN the/DT Bronx/NNP ,/, took/VBD the/DT same/JJ route/NN home/NN in/IN their/PRP$ separate/JJ cars/NNS ./.

The/DT accounts/NNS of/IN what/WP happened/VBD next/JJ vary/VBP ,/, depending/VBG on/IN who/WP is/VBZ telling/VBG the/DT story/NN ./.

Wyatt/NNP testified/VBD that/IN he/PRP saw/VBD a/DT car/NN go/VBP through/IN a/DT red/JJ light/NN in/IN the/DT Bronx/NNP ./.

Pulling/VBG alongside/IN the/DT car/NN moments/NNS later/RB ,/, Wyatt/NNP said/VBD ,/, he/PRP told/VBD the/DT driver/NN to/TO be/VB more/RBR careful/JJ ./.

The/DT other/JJ driver/NN was/VBD Robinson/NNP ,/, then/RB employed/VBN at/IN the/DT Taconic/NNP Correctional/NNP Facility/NNP in/IN Westchester/NNP County/NNP ./.

The/DT drivers/NNS got/VBD out/RP of/IN their/PRP$ cars/NNS ,/, and/CC after/IN a/DT confrontation/NN --/: Robinson/NNP said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD attacked/VBN --/: the/DT officer/NN shot/VBD Wyatt/NNP ./.

Moments/NNS later/RB ,/, Plunkett/NNP drove/VBD up/RP ,/, saw/VBD what/WP was/VBD happening/VBG and/CC got/VBD out/RP of/IN his/PRP$ car/NN to/TO confront/VB Robinson/NNP ,/, who/WP shot/VBD him/PRP also/RB ./.

Robinson/NNP has/VBZ maintained/VBN that/IN he/PRP fired/VBD only/RB in/IN self-defense/NN and/CC after/IN showing/VBG his/PRP$ correction/NN officer/NN 's/POS badge/NN and/CC firing/NN warning/NN shots/NNS ./.

Years/NNS ago/RB ,/, a/DT Bronx/NNP grand/JJ jury/NN declined/VBD to/TO indict/VB Robinson/NNP ./.

Wyatt/NNP and/CC Plunkett/NNP then/RB sued/VBD the/DT state/NN ,/, contending/VBG that/IN the/DT Department/NNP of/IN Correctional/NNP Services/NNPS should/MD never/RB have/VB hired/VBN Robinson/NNP ,/, and/CC that/IN its/PRP$ screening/NN and/CC training/NN of/IN applicants/NNS was/VBD inadequate/JJ ./.

To/TO illustrate/VB their/PRP$ point/NN ,/, they/PRP noted/VBD that/IN the/DT department/NN had/VBD failed/VBN to/TO take/VB action/NN against/IN Robinson/NNP in/IN an/DT incident/NN in/IN 1984/CD ,/, when/WRB he/PRP shot/VBD and/CC killed/VBD a/DT dog/NN in/IN the/DT Bronx/NNP ./.

The/DT dog/NN 's/POS owner/NN testified/VBD that/IN he/PRP had/VBD notified/VBN the/DT state/NN ,/, to/TO no/DT avail/NN ./.

Robinson/NNP testified/VBD he/PRP was/VBD on/IN crutches/NNS at/IN the/DT time/NN and/CC shot/VBD the/DT dog/NN because/IN he/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO attack/VB him/PRP ./.

The/DT plaintiffs/NNS '/POS suit/NN was/VBD dismissed/VBN by/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Claims/NNS in/IN 1990/CD ,/, but/CC the/DT Appellate/NNP Division/NNP reinstated/VBD it/PRP a/DT year/NN later/RB ,/, holding/VBG that/IN the/DT state/NN was/VBD liable/JJ ./.

The/DT case/NN went/VBD to/TO the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Claims/NNP again/RB for/IN the/DT purpose/NN of/IN awarding/VBG damages/NNS ./.

When/WRB Wyatt/NNP was/VBD shot/VBN ,/, he/PRP was/VBD 43/CD years/NNS old/JJ and/CC worked/VBN as/IN a/DT specialist/NN clerk/NN on/IN the/DT floor/NN of/IN the/DT New/NNP York/NNP Stock/NNP Exchange/NNP ./.

In/IN the/DT ruling/NN this/DT week/NN ,/, Blinder/NNP said/VBD that/IN Wyatt/NNP 's/POS recovery/NN had/VBD been/VBN an/DT ordeal/NN that/WDT included/VBD abdominal/JJ surgery/NN ,/, partial/JJ disability/NN of/IN his/PRP$ right/JJ hip/NN and/CC leg/NN and/CC constant/JJ pain/NN that/WDT caused/VBD him/PRP to/TO make/VB repeated/VBN mistakes/NNS and/CC has/VBZ hampered/VBN his/PRP$ career/NN ./.

``/`` What/WP he/PRP lost/VBD was/VBD the/DT opportunity/NN for/IN dramatic/JJ advancement/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT judge/NN wrote/VBD ./.

Plunkett/NN ,/, 35/CD ,/, was/VBD a/DT stockbroker/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN he/PRP was/VBD shot/VBN in/IN the/DT left/JJ hip/NN ./.

The/DT judge/NN wrote/VBD that/IN Plunkett/NNP spent/VBD agonizing/JJ weeks/NNS in/IN the/DT hospital/NN and/CC was/VBD left/VBN with/IN a/DT shortened/JJ leg/NN that/WDT has/VBZ curtailed/VBN his/PRP$ previously/RB athletic/JJ way/NN of/IN life/NN ./.

Robinson/NNP is/VBZ being/VBG sued/VBN separately/RB in/IN state/NN Supreme/NNP Court/NNP ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT plaintiffs/NNS '/POS lawyers/NNS ,/, Richard/NNP Dienst/NNP and/CC Barry/NNP Washor/NNP for/IN Wyatt/NNP and/CC Lawrence/NNP Epstein/NNP for/IN Plunkett/NNP ./.

Dienst/NNP said/VBD he/PRP understood/VBD that/IN Robinson/NNP was/VBD still/RB working/VBG for/IN the/DT correction/NN agency/NN ./.

Robinson/NNP could/MD not/RB be/VB reached/VBN for/IN comment/NN ,/, nor/CC could/MD officials/NNS who/WP could/MD confirm/VB his/PRP$ employment/NN ./.
