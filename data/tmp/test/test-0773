News/NNP Analysis/NNP :/: Will/MD Bangladesh/NNP Agree/VB to/TO Export/NNP Gas/NNP ?/.

During/IN U.S./NNP President/NNP Clinton/NNP 's/POS wind-whirling/JJ visit/NN to/TO Bangladesh/NNP on/IN March/NNP 20/CD ,/, the/DT issue/NN of/IN gas/NN export/NN will/MD feature/VB prominently/RB on/IN the/DT itinerary/NN of/IN his/PRP$ short/JJ stay/NN ./.

Actually/RB it/PRP worked/VBD as/IN the/DT major/JJ catalyst/NN to/TO Clinton/NNP 's/POS visit/NN ,/, though/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS dismissed/VBD the/DT notion/NN ./.

Will/MD Bangladesh/NNP then/RB agree/VB to/TO open/VB its/PRP$ gas/NN sector/NN ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, agree/VBP to/TO export/VB its/PRP$ gas/NN to/TO any/DT other/JJ country/NN during/IN Clinton/NNP 's/POS visit/NN ?/.

Bangladeshi/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Sheikh/NNP Hasina/NNP ,/, in/IN a/DT recent/JJ television/NN program/NN ,/, said/VBD Bangladesh/NNP would/MD consider/VB the/DT possibilities/NNS of/IN exporting/VBG gas/NN only/RB after/IN becoming/VBG sure/JJ that/IN it/PRP had/VBD a/DT reserve/NN for/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ for/IN 50/CD years/NNS ./.

According/VBG to/TO official/JJ estimate/NN ,/, the/DT current/JJ proven/JJ deposit/NN of/IN gas/NN in/IN the/DT country/NN is/VBZ 13/CD trillion/CD cubic/JJ feet/NNS ,/, which/WDT will/MD be/VB exhausted/VBN in/IN 35/CD years/NNS under/IN the/DT current/JJ reserve-to-production/JJ ratio/NN ./.

Other/JJ senior/JJ government/NN officials/NNS held/VBD similar/JJ opinion/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP suggested/VBD to/TO set/VB up/RP power/NN plants/NNS or/CC fertilizer/NN plants/NNS based/VBN on/IN natural/JJ gas/NN instead/RB of/IN gas/NN export/NN ./.

The/DT major/JJ opposition/NN parties/NNS also/RB took/VBD similar/JJ stand/NN on/IN gas/NN export/NN ./.

Bangladesh/NNP Nationalist/NNP Party/NNP Secretary/NNP General/NNP Abdul/NNP Mannan/NNP Bhuiyan/NNP Wednesday/NNP put/VBD up/RP his/PRP$ party/NN 's/POS proposal/NN concerning/VBG the/DT natural/JJ resources/NNS ,/, which/WDT includes/VBZ determining/VBG the/DT actual/JJ deposit/NN of/IN gas/NN both/DT in/IN the/DT discovered/VBN and/CC undiscovered/JJ fields/NNS ,/, fixing/VBG up/RP the/DT actual/JJ demand/NN of/IN gas/NN consumption/NN in/IN domestic/JJ industries/NNS ,/, households/NNS and/CC power/NN generation/NN for/IN the/DT next/JJ 50/CD years/NNS ,/, not/RB leasing/VBG out/RP all/PDT the/DT gas/NN fields/NNS at/IN a/DT time/NN and/CC also/RB keeping/VBG prospective/JJ gas/NN blocks/NNS reserved/VBN for/IN state-owned/JJ Petrobangla/NNP for/IN exploration/NN ./.

As/IN to/TO the/DT international/JJ oil/NN companies/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- IOCs/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, however/RB ,/, they/PRP believe/VBP no/DT gas/NN for/IN exports/NNS means/VBZ no/DT exploration/NN ./.

As/IN gas/NN exploration/NN is/VBZ an/DT expensive/JJ proposition/NN ,/, they/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO know/VB about/IN the/DT prospects/NNS of/IN selling/VBG regarding/VBG the/DT recovery/NN of/IN their/PRP$ investment/NN and/CC profit-making/NN ./.

Under/IN production/NN sharing/NN contracts/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- PSCs/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- signed/VBN so/RB far/RB between/IN the/DT Bangladeshi/NNP government/NN and/CC the/DT IOCs/NNPS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP to/TO sell/VB gas/NN to/TO the/DT state-owned/JJ Petrobangla/NN only/RB and/CC not/RB to/TO any/DT other/JJ country/NN ./.

The/DT gas/NN price/NN is/VBZ determined/VBN by/IN the/DT quarterly/JJ average/JJ price/NN of/IN High/NNP Sulfur/NNP Fuel/NNP Oil/NNP in/IN Singapore/NNP market/NN under/IN the/DT Gas/NNP Purchase/NNP and/CC Sales/NNP Agreement/NNP ./.

And/CC the/DT current/JJ level/NN of/IN very/RB high/JJ petroleum/NN price/NN has/VBZ already/RB affected/VBN Petrobangla/NNP adversely/RB ./.

Petrobangla/NNP is/VBZ facing/VBG financial/JJ problem/NN to/TO meet/VB its/PRP$ commitment/NN and/CC has/VBZ sought/VBN relief/NN from/IN its/PRP$ debt/NN servicing/VBG liability/NN and/CC value/NN -/: added/VBN taxes/NNS to/TO tide/NN over/IN the/DT situation/NN ./.

This/DT has/VBZ clearly/RB demonstrated/VBN that/IN Bangladesh/NNP will/MD find/VB it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO purchase/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ natural/JJ gas/NN from/IN the/DT IOCs/NNPS unless/IN it/PRP is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO raise/VB its/PRP$ export/NN earnings/NNS substantially/RB by/IN exporting/VBG gas/NN through/IN pipeline/NN ./.

As/IN gas/NN exploration/NN is/VBZ an/DT expensive/JJ proposition/NN ,/, it/PRP could/MD not/RB afford/VB to/TO explore/VB without/IN foreign/JJ investment/NN ./.

What/WP about/IN establishing/VBG gas-based/JJ industries/NNS and/CC exporting/VBG their/PRP$ products/NNS to/TO earn/VB foreign/JJ currency/NN and/CC pay/VB the/DT IOCs/NNPS for/IN buying/VBG gas/NN from/IN them/PRP ?/.

Citing/VBG a/DT U.S./NNP study/NN ,/, Forrest/NNP E./NNP Cookson/NNP ,/, president/NN of/IN the/DT American/NNP Chamber/NNP in/IN Bangladesh/NNP said/VBD Bangladesh/NNP might/MD get/VB 1.50/CD U.S./NNP dollar/NN by/IN exporting/VBG 1,000/CD cubic/JJ feet/NNS gas/NN through/IN pipelines/NNS ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT export/NN of/IN power/NN with/IN the/DT same/JJ volume/NN of/IN gas/NN would/MD earn/VB the/DT country/NN 1.25/CD dollar/NN ,/, fertilizer/NN 0.60/CD dollar/NN and/CC liquefied/VBN natural/JJ gas/NN only/RB 0.40/CD dollar/NN ,/, after/IN deducting/VBG the/DT cost/NN of/IN production/NN ./.

So/IN these/DT projects/NNS would/MD eventually/RB not/RB be/VB cost-effective/JJ ,/, and/CC Bangladesh/NNP is/VBZ almost/RB certainly/RB ``/`` better/JJR off/RB in/IN sending/VBG it/PRP in/IN pipeline/NN ''/'' than/IN the/DT other/JJ options/NNS ,/, Cookson/NNP said/VBD ./.

Foreign/JJ companies/NNS ,/, including/VBG Unocal/NNP from/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ,/, engaged/VBN in/IN gas/NN exploration/NN in/IN Bangladesh/NNP ,/, roughly/RB estimated/VBD that/IN the/DT deposit/NN would/MD be/VB from/IN 30/CD trillion/CD to/TO 50/CD trillion/CD cubic/JJ feet/NNS ,/, which/WDT could/MD easily/RB meet/VB the/DT domestic/JJ demands/NNS for/IN the/DT next/JJ 50/CD years/NNS ./.

And/CC the/DT U.S./NNP business/NN leaders/NNS pledged/VBD to/TO invest/VB 600/CD million/CD dollars/NNS a/DT year/NN if/IN Bangladesh/NNP decides/VBZ to/TO export/VB gas/NN to/TO India/NNP through/IN pipelines/NNS ./.

Recently/RB ,/, they/PRP even/RB come/VB up/RP with/IN a/DT new/JJ proposal/NN that/IN Bangladesh/NNP could/MD invest/VB on/IN hydroelectricity/NN in/IN Nepal/NNP and/CC Bhutan/NNP to/TO get/VB hydropower/NN at/IN a/DT cheap/JJ price/NN in/IN exchange/NN of/IN exporting/VBG gas/NN ,/, saying/VBG that/IN donors/NNS and/CC international/JJ business/NN circle/NN would/MD naturally/RB be/VB interested/JJ in/IN providing/VBG assistance/NN for/IN such/PDT an/DT integrated/JJ project/NN under/IN a/DT regional/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

U.S./NNP Secretary/NNP of/IN State/NNP Madeleine/NNP Albright/NNP said/VBD Wednesday/NNP that/IN ``/`` with/IN right/JJ policies/NNS in/IN place/NN ,/, Bangladesh/NNP could/MD make/VB a/DT quantum/NN leap/NN forward/RB by/IN exploiting/VBG its/PRP$ vast/JJ energy/NN reserves/NNS ,/, particularly/RB in/IN natural/JJ gas/NN ./. ''/''

She/PRP opined/VBD that/IN American/JJ companies/NNS could/MD be/VB the/DT ''/'' perfect/JJ partners/NNS to/TO help/VB seize/VB such/JJ opportunities/NNS ./. ''/''

Under/IN the/DT dual/JJ pressure/NN from/IN the/DT U.S./NNP government/NN and/CC the/DT IOCs/NNPS ,/, Bangladesh/NNP will/MD feel/VB it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO stand/VB firm/NN on/IN its/PRP$ previous/JJ position/NN ./.

Opening/NN gas/NN sector/NN is/VBZ only/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN time/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, considering/VBG the/DT domestic/JJ pressure/NN ,/, The/DT Bangladeshi/NNP government/NN won/NN '/POS t/NN make/VBP decision/NN hastily/RB during/IN Clinton/NNP 's/POS visit/NN to/TO allow/VB gas/NN export/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD sign/VB new/JJ production/NN sharing/NN contracts/NNS with/IN some/DT other/JJ IOCs/NNS first/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT opening-up/NN of/IN the/DT gas/NN sector/NN will/MD be/VB done/VBN in/IN phases/NNS ./.
