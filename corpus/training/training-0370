Chinese General Meets With Bangladeshi Military Leader 
General Fu Quanyou, chief of the general staff of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA), in a meeting here today with Bangladesh's Chief
of the Army Staff Muhammad Mustafizur Rahman, said China is in firm
opposition to all forms of hegemonism and power politics and that all
peace-loving nations are extremely concerned about the NATO's
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
He called for an immediate halt to the airstrikes to put the Kosovo
issue back on the track towards a settlement by a political approach.
China and Bangladesh are friendly close neighbors who have a
traditional friendship, he said, and who have always supported and
helped each other in international affairs. Bilateral cooperation in
all areas, including politics and the economy, have made progress, and
the ties between the armies of the two countries are becoming tighter,
thanks to the great attention given by government and military leaders,
he noted.
The Bangladeshi government agrees that all conflicts should be resolved
through dialogues and with the participation of the United Nations,
Mustafizur said, and he stressed that it is the sincere hope of the
Bangladeshi government that the friendship and cooperative ties between
Bangladesh and China and their armed forces will be strengthened.
