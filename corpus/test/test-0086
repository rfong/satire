EU organises seminar on political options for Somalia 
Around 30 Somali intellectuals are to meet in the western Kenyan town
of Naivasha on Thursday for a three-day EU-funded seminar on political
structures for Somalia, the EU office here said.
The discussions will centre around different types of administration
which could be considered by Somali decision-makers setting up future
governments in the war-torn country.
Somalia has not had a proper government since the ouster of former
dictator Siad Barre in 1991 and has been riven by factional fighting.
