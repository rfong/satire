S Africa tables law correcting racial imbalances 
A draft bill aimed at correcting imbalances in media ownership in South
Africa created by apartheid was tabled Monday, amid warnings the
legislation could encourage government control of the press.
The Media Development and Diversity Agency bill states that funding
will be sought and handed out by a special board to people to start
small media enterprises in communities whose needs were not served
under white rule.
The members of the board will be nominated by parliament's portfolio
committee and appointed by President Thabo Mbeki, according to the
bill.
The opposition Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) said it supported attempts
to promote media diversity but believed politicians should not decide
who sits on the board as this meant that "the president can ultimately
decide who gets what."
"One needs only to look at Zimbabwe to see the danger of government
interference in the media," IFP MP Suzanne Vos told AFP.
"If grants are given to the media, we need to ask to whom and ensure
it's not used for party political purposes."
The chairman of the communications committee, Ned Kekana -- a member of
the ruling African National Congress -- said the bill should be passed
by parliament by April.
It was introduced by Essop Pahad, the minister in the presidency. He
has denied that there would be any government interference in the
content of new publications that see the light as the result of the
bill.
