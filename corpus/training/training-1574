Hungary to Open Air Space for U.S. to Fight Terrorism 
The Hungarian government proposed Friday to open the country's air
space and airports for the United States in its fight against terrorism
in the wake of last week' terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.
The country's national security committee made the decision at a
meeting, which also promised ground service for U.S. warplanes. The
proposal needs yet to be approved by the Hungarian parliament in
accordance with relevant laws on the use of Hungarian air space or
airports by foreign warplanes.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Martonyi Janos told reporters after the
meeting that Hungary had been earlier approached by Washington with
such a request. He added that the U.S. request was made without
elaborating on details. It does not suggest immediate passage or use of
airbases by U.S. warplanes, he said.
The Hungarian foreign minister hoped that the parliament would discuss
the proposal and make a decision next week.
