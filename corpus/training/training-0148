Beijing Rules To Support Its High-Tech Industries 
Beijing has decided to loosen the rules for establishing a high-tech
enterprise to accelerate the development of its high-tech industries.
A ruling of the municipal government today says that high-tech
enterprises can sign an agreement with a risk investment institution to
serve as guarantor if they do not have sufficient capital.
The government will also have measures to protect the names of
high-tech enterprises with registered capital above 500,000 yuan (
about 60,000 U.S. dollars).
Graduate students and others involved in scientific research in
colleges and in institutes are also allowed to start high-tech
enterprises, according to the rules, and foreigners and people from
Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan can hold senior management positions in
high-tech enterprises.
Licenses of these high-tech enterprises can be obtained in five days
after the application papers are submitted.
