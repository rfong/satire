Washington meanwhile refused to join Paris and London in expressing concern
and simply reasserted that Jewish settlements were "unhelpful" and
"complicated" negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
There was some speculation that Christopher may embark on a Middle East
tour once he wins the support of the European leaders on a common
approach to the worsening situation in the region.
Christopher holds talks Thursday with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind in London before traveling to Paris to meet with his French
counterpart Herve de Charette and President Jacques Chirac.
He holds meetings in Bonn on Friday with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
who will pay a visit to Russian President Boris Yeltsin the following
day to get a first-hand glimpse of his state of health.
On Bosnia, Christopher hopes to strengthen the resolve of Europeans to
move forward with elections in the Balkan republic on September 14.
Washington earlier this year overcame European resistance in the
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) -- the body
tasked with organising the elections -- to allow the ballot to be held
by mid-September.
