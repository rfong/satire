Thai PM Orders Security Beef-up Against Terrorism 
Thai National security council has been told to step up its
surveillance of immigrants entering the country to prevent terrorism
following the Oklahoma City bombing, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said
Monday.
He said security was tightened after he received reports that hundreds
of thousands of illegal immigrants have entered the country.
Chuan said police officers have been told to take safety precautions
after the disastrous bombing which prompted the US State Department to
ask its embassy here to step up security, local press reported today.
It was reported that Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said Monday
that Thailand was vulnerable to terrorism because it was a base for
many international organizations and the local authorities would have
to work hard to protect members of international organization and the
mass media.
