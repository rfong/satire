Three Cricketers Suspended for Drug Use 
Three New Zealand cricketers have been suspended for smoking marijuana
during the recent tour of South Africa.
Stephen Fleming, Matthew Hart and Dion Nash were banned for three
one-day internationals against the West Indies, New Zealand Cricket
chairman Peter McDermott said Thursday.
Confirming the players will miss Sunday's one-day match in Auckland,
McDermott said recent times had been `the darkest weeks in the history
of the sport.''
McDermott said the ``woeful results'' recorded in recent times by New
Zealand had been caused by a ``general lack of self discipline and
application -- and we've had enough.''
The ban means Canterbury batsman Fleming, Northern Districts
all-rounder Hart and Nash will miss the entire one-day series against
the West Indies. Sunday's opening match is to be followed by games in
Wellington next Wednesday and Christchurch on Jan. 28.
McDermott said their replacements would be Auckland pair Justin Vaughan
and Dipak Patel -- Patel subject to a fitness test -- and Northern
Districts' bowler Royden Hayes.
Allegations of players smoking marijuana surfaced when the New Zealand
team returned from South Africa recently where they lost the test
series 1-0 and failed to win a one-day international.
Both the coach Geoff Howarth and manager Mike Sandlant have since
resigned.
At a packed press conference in Auckland on Thursday, McDermott said
there were many people in New Zealand who looked to the New Zealand
cricket team as role models and heroes, and it was essential strong
action was taken when team members acted inappropriately.
He said the behavior of the three players who had been suspended was
endemic of ``a wider malaise that appears to have recently infected the
game.''
