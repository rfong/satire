Soldiers Accused of Beating Koreans
Police on Monday turned over to U.S. military authorities eight
American soldiers who allegedly assaulted two South Koreans in a brawl.
The soldiers were accused of beating two South Korean men trying to
break up their brawl with a taxi driver Sunday night in Chunchon, 80
kilometers (50 miles) east of Seoul, police said.
The U.S. soldiers, all belonging to an aviation unit in Chunchon, were
immediately detained, they added.
The national news agency Yonhap identified one soldier as Cpl. Paul A.
Jullen, 22. No further information on Jullen, including his hometown,
were available.
The turnover was in accordance with a 1965 agreement under which U.S.
soldiers involved in criminal cases in South Korea remain under U.S.
custody pending investigation and trial.
The case, the second of its kind in three days, sparked local media
criticism. South Korean newspapers and television played up the news
and demanded that the accord be revised to give South Korea greater
legal jurisdiction over crimes involving U.S. soldiers.
On Saturday, 12 drunken U.S. soldiers were seized by South Korean
police and then turned over to U.S. military authorities for allegedly
beating a Korean man during a brawl at a Seoul subway station.
Five were summoned by South Korean police Monday to appear for police
questioning by Thursday morning.
The U.S. military command in Seoul has expressed regret over the
incident and promised cooperation with the South Korean police
investigation.
Meanwhile, in Kwangju, 240 kilometers (142 miles) south of Seoul, about
800 students burned a U.S. flag during a campus rally to demand
punishment for the soldiers involved in the two cases, Yonhap reported.
The students threw rocks when police, firing tear gas, blocked them
from marching out of the campus, the report said. Students also
demanded the closure of the U.S. Cultural Center.
About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a defense
treaty, and are constantly under media scrutiny. Crimes involving them
are treated as major news and often trigger angry reactions from
Koreans demanding that Seoul strengthen jurisdiction over the U.S.
soldiers.
