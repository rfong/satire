Human Cloning Must be Prohibited: Japanese Panel 
Human cloning should not be allowed and research on genetic engineering
should proceed only with the consent of the general public, the
advisory committee to Japan's Science and Technology Agency said today.
Noting that many countries, including Japan, do not approve of human
cloning, the committee said there should be legal restrictions on such
experiments.
It recommended that the Japanese government set up an special agency to
deal with genetic engineering research. It also stressed the need to
raise the general public's understanding of the potential impact of
such research and urged an examination of the ethical and social issues
involved.
The committee said the system to evaluate the safety of genetic
engineering should be improved in order to prevent harmful effects on
people and the environment.
