"Something has to be done to really alleviate the economic hardship in
Gaza and the West Bank, otherwise we all fear that the whole peace
process will really come to an end," he said.
"We have to also think of the future and the future generations," he
said.
The Meridor-Masri meeting was the highest level economic contact
between Israel and the PA since the closure was imposed in late
February.
It came in the context of a gradual acceleration of the peace process
which had largely been stalemated since Netanyahu came to power at the
head of a coalition of right-wing and nationalist parties which had a
long history of fierce opposition to Palestinian autonomy.
After resuming technical discussions with the PA earlier this month,
Netanyahu decided on Monday in a meeting with Meridor, Defence Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign Minister David Levy to set up a special
team to study ways of supporting the Palestinian economy.
Israeli and Palestinian officials say broader political negotiations
will also resume soon after a six-month break.
Also since the weekend a summit meeting between Netanyahu and PA
President Yasser Arafat has appeared increasingly likely.
Israel's President Ezer Weizman announced Sunday that he was prepared
to meet Arafat in a move widely seen as designed to pressure Netanyahu
into giving up his reluctance to encounter the Palestinian leader.
The Israeli media has speculated that the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting
could take place as early as this Sunday or between the Jewish holidays
of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur in late September.
But the offices of both men insist that no date for a meeting has been
set.
