Dollar rises against major currencies in active trading 
The dollar rose sharply against major foreign currencies in active
trading here Thursday as traders sought to cover their positions and
limit losses.
Gold meanwhile lost 10 cents to 383.50 dollars an ounce from its
closing price Wednesday.
At 4:45 p.m. (2045 GMT), the greenback was worth 1.4340 German marks,
down from 1.4355 marks earlier in the day but up from 1.3884 marks at
the previous close.
Against the yen, it was worth 85.65 yen, down from 86.15 yen earlier in
the day but up from 83.90 yen at Wednesday's close.
The dollar climbed against major European currencies: to 5.0355 French
francs against 4.8755 late Wednesday, to 1.1960 Swiss francs against
1.1495, and to 0.6398 pounds sterling from 0.6307 pounds at the
previous close.
The dollar gained throughout the day after surpassing the threshold of
1.4225 marks, said Tom Renfer of the Bank of Montreal in New York.
The greenback's recovery began overnight as the German mark weakened,
after German monetary officials alluded to a possible relaxation in
monetary policy, Renfer said.
Against the yen, the dollar profited from US abandonment of the strong
yen policy and the announcement that Washington would take concrete
measures to reduce its huge trade deficit with Japan, he added.
The US Trade Representative announced Wednesday that sanctions against
Japan were imminent following the collapse of bilateral auto trade
talks over the weekend.
Traders seemed unconcerned by a 0.5 percent rise in producer prices in
April.
Most economists believe that slower US economic growth will hold
inflation at bay and that the slowdown will not be sufficiently serious
or long-lasting to justify an interest-rate cut.
