Rain washes out first round of LPGA Championship 
Rain wiped out Thursday's scheduled first round of the 1.2
million-dollar LPGA Championship, reducing the women's golf major event
to 54 holes.
The field of 144 golfers in quest of the 180,000 dollars will begin
play Friday at DuPont Country Club, with the cut coming after round two
Saturday.
More than two inches of rain fell on the course earlier in the week and
two-tenths of an inch that fell on Wednesday night, pushing the course
to its saturation point.
"We're disappointed the course is unplayable," tournament director
Betsy Rawls said. "We're pleased with the decision and we'll move
forward. Hopefully it'll be nice and sunny from here on in."
Kelly Robbins seeks a second consecutive LPGA Championship title after
finishing second to Australia's Karrie Webb, a 21-year-old who is off
to the hottest start in women's golf history.
Webb has won 462,388 dollars to lead to LPGA TOur with Robbins second
at 348,493 dollars.
