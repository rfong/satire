Satirist Bitten By Rabid Fan; In Trouble For Pissing On Sacred Cows
Satirist, King David was attacked yesterday by a rabid Appalachian
State University fan who felt like one of his sacred cows had been
pissed on. As King was just about to close the gate (where the cow was
after it was pissed on), the dog jumped out of nowhere and bit the
satirist on his rump.
"I was entirely surprised," said the confounded satirist. "The damned
dog came out of nowhere and bit me on the ass!" King was treated and
released by doctors at Duke University Hospital and told to go home and
nurse his wounds.
The satirist was reported to have deliberated at what to do about the
dog after the attack, and, apparently decided to write another article
in response.
This isn't the first time a writer for The Spoof magazine has been
attacked for writing articles. Several years ago, the writer,
Jalapeñoman was bitten on the leg for writing an article against
corporate water monopolies in the desert. The writer affectionately
known as the "J-man," in a move to protect himself that only a
poisonous frog or professional wrestler could emulate, turned himself
from a man into a Jalapeno pepper.
"Now, bite me you insidious bastards!" he was reported to have said.
"This is the kind of Tom Foolery and acid tonguery that we expect from
our writers," said The Spoof editor-in-chief, Mark Lowton of Lowton
Brothers Enterprises.
"We want our writers to go to where the stories are, and, oftentimes
the stories are about troglodytes buried, or hidden in their own back
yards. Writer's seek truth at whatever the cost," he said.
"It's not uncommon for writers, particularly satirists to be thrown out
of their countries. Satirists have a history of this," said Professor
of Humanities, Dr. Hyman Curl. "Others, like H.L. Mencken, become
editors of major newspapers such as the Baltimore Sun. It just depends
on who's in power at the time."
"The threat of violence is always present when you live on the edge as
we do," satiric writer from the Spoof magazine, Breeze stated in an
off-hand conversation with other writers.
"We writers are a hardy breed, courageous and valiant, ever ready to
tweak the nose of terror with our humorous scribblings and stand tall
in the face of adversity. Although, just to be on the safe side, I
generally target people weaker than myself, the disabled and elderly,
for example," Breeze continued.
What a guy. Gotta love 'em.
