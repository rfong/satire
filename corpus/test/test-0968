Bomb That Killed N.J. Executive Was Mailed In S.F.
Jim Freeman, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Francisco office,
asked the public to ``examine the possibility that the UNABOM suspect
does live in one of our communities.''
The FBI, which is working on the UNABOM case jointly with the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Postal Service, urged
anyone with information about the bomber to call the toll-free hotline,
1-800-701-BOMB. Anonymity will be granted, and informants will be given
identification numbers. A $1 million reward has been offered.
UNABOM is the name given by federal agents to a mysterious bomber who
has killed two men and injured 23 other people in a 16-year terror
campaign that appears to be aimed at universities, airlines and
computer-related enterprises. The most recent incident occurred
Saturday when Thomas J. Mosser, the recently named general manager and
executive vice president of Young &AMP; Rubicam in New York, was killed
in his North Caldwell, N.J., home when he opened a bomb that has since
been identified as a creation of the UNABOM perpetrator.
The revelation that the Mosser bomb was mailed from San Francisco now
means that of the 15 incidents attributed to the bomber, seven either
were mailed from or exploded in Northern California. The bomber also
mailed a letter to the New York Times from Sacramento last year at
about the time two of his devices injured professors in Marin County,
Calif., and at Yale University in New Haven, Conn.
The small package that exploded in at Mosser's kitchen bore a postmark
date of Saturday, December 3, and arrived at Mosser's home on Friday,
December 9. He did not open the package until the next day. It had a
San Francisco return address, but FBI agents said a cursory check
indicates ``there is not a person by that name at that particular
location.''
When the package was mailed is important because some investigators
have speculated that the bomber has, of late, been choosing his victims
from the pages of newspapers. Mosser's promotion to his new post was
mentioned in the Wall Street Journal one day before the bomb was
mailed.
Freeman said agents are still reconstructing fragments of the
packaging. He would not divulge which post office in San Francisco
handled the package.
``I want the general public ... to be particularly alert,'' Freeman
said, adding that it is ``very pertinent'' that the UNABOM killer has
been physically located in Northern California, Utah and Illinois,
perhaps for short periods of time.
``He certainly has a familiarity with the Bay Area and San Francisco.
Whether or not he is a full-time resident, I don't know,'' Freeman
said. ``He may even appear to be a very nice guy. (He) could easily be
the person living next door.''
Packages carrying bombs through the mail bore postage stamps,
indicating that the suspect probably affixed them himself to avoid
contact with a postal clerk. Not all of the packages are alike, and the
bomber has used different methods of detonation.
``There has been a progression in the sophistication of devices ... and
the destructiveness of the explosions,'' Freeman said.
Although the FBI has yet to identify a suspect, Freeman said, ``we are
progressing in terms of gathering data relative to similarities between
the victims.''
FBI agents are warning the public to be alert to any suspicious
packages, such as those that are unexpected or bear an unfamiliar
return address -- or no return address at all.
``To allay any widespread public concern, it should be noted that all
mailed devices thus far have targeted specific individuals.''
Since the first bomb exploded on a unversity campus in Chicago in 1978,
investigators have been stumped by the bomber. Freeman said eight of
the bombs have been mailed to individuals, and seven others placed in
areas where they would be disturbed and detonate.
``There's quite a spectrum of targets ... we have a very broad spectrum
of victims,'' he said. ``We don't have that good a handle on the
targets because they run such a broad range.''
But although Mosser's death apparently is a departure from other UNABOM
incidents, in that Mosser was in the advertising business, clues can be
found, some investigators noted, in the timing of recent events
connected to both Mosser and Young &AMP; Rubicam.
Six of the bombings, including the December 1985 killing of Hugh
Campbell Strutton in Sacramento, were connected to computers. Strutton
owned a computer store, and the other victims, none of whom died,
either were computer professors or worked in university computer
science buildings.
In November, there were brief announcements in the New York Times that
Young &AMP; Rubicam had picked up two computer-related firms as clients
-- Massachusetts-based Digital Equipment Corp. and the Desktop Document
Systems division of Xerox Corp., of Palo Alto, Calif. Three days after
the Xerox Corp. announcement, the Wall Street Journal ran its story
about Mosser's promotion to the top job at Young &AMP; Rubicam.
The computer link in the UNABOM case is being considered seriously by
investigators, who have been pondering the meaning of the initials,
``FC,'' which have appeared on at least seven of the bomber's devices.
The initials also appeared in the letter the bombmaker sent the New
York Times. Speculation about the meaning of FC has run the gamut from
F-- Computers to Fight Control, according to Michael Reynolds, who
spent nearly a year following the UNABOM case for an article in Playboy
Magazine.
Reynolds said in an interview yesterday that the federal UNABOM task
force has run down 5,000 leads and amassed a list of 200 suspects, all
to no avail.
