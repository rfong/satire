S. African Revenue Service Ready for SA-EU Trade Agreement 
The South African Revenue Service is ready for the implementation of
the South Africa- European Union Free Trade Agreement, it said in a
statement Thursday.
The statement said the SARS had finalized all its preparatory work for
the introduction of the agreement and the administration of the Rules
of Origin, scheduled to come into effect on January 1.
These rules provide for the necessary certification of goods to ensure
that they receive preferential treatment in terms of the agreement,
SARS spokesman Fani Zulu told reporters.
He said amendments to the Customs and Excise Act, made to accommodate
the agreement and allow the SARS to act in accordance with the
agreement, were published in the Government Gazette Thursday.
Also gazetted were the regulatory framework and revised schedules to
implement the phasing down of the rates of duty in 2000, as provided
for in the agreement, added Zulu.
The spokesman said most of the customs offices handling international
cargo movements would not process commercial traffic from Friday to
Sunday.
These offices include Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban,
Richard's Bay, Saldanha Bay, Mossel Bay, Johannesburg, Germiston,
Bloemfontein, Pietermaritzburg, Upington, and the Johannesburg, Cape
Town and Durban international airports, he said.
