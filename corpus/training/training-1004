Tanzanian Scientist Wins Award for Marine Conservation
A renowned Tanzanian marine scientist has won a fellowship of 150,000
U.S. dollars for his contribution to marine conservation.
Dr. Magnus Ngoile, Director General of the Tanzanian National
Environment Management Council, won the Pew Marine Conservation
Fellowship from the United States Pew Charitable Trusts, The Guardian
reported Tuesday.
One of the world's largest and most prestigious awards for sea
preservation, the fellowship is in recognition of Ngoile's dedication
and professional approach in marine conservation.
Ngoile's Pew Fellowship resource will be utilized in establishing a
marine reserve in Kilwa, a pristine coastal district south of Dar es
Salaam.
The district has a coastal strip of about 150 kilometers long which is
full of reefs and historical areas.
The Pew-funded project, he said, will not only establish a marine park
but also become the guiding light for future development and contribute
toward a more dynamic economy.
Ngoile is the second Tanzanian to win this award. The first was
Professor Adelaide Semesi, who won it in 1997.
