Hundred Foreign Buyers Cancel Visit to Jakarta Expo 
About 100 foreign buyers have officially canceled their attendance of
the Indonesian Resources Exhibition 2001, scheduled to be held here on
October 24-28, citing inconducive security condition.
"As a result of the increasing tension between the United States and
Afghanistan, a number of buyers -- mainly from the Netherlands and some
other European countries -- have canceled their attendance of the
exhibition," head of the National Agency for Export Development of the
Industry and Trade Ministry Gusmardi Bustami said here Wednesday.
He pointed out that the 25 American businessmen, who had earlier
confirmed their attendance, have not made any cancellation.
Gusmardi admitted that the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York
and Washington D.C., coupled with the U.S. military action on
Afghanistan, have forced the organizing committee to revise the target
of 6,000 foreign buyers for this year's exhibition.
"Last year, the number of foreign buyers who attended the exhibition
was 4,800. It would be noteworthy if the same number can come to this
year's event," he was quoted by the Antara News Agency as saying.
Gusmardi also disclosed that he has asked the police and the National
Intelligence Body to help secure the exhibition to give a sense of
safety to participants and buyers.
