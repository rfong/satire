Iraqi vice president to Sudan, Yemen 
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan left Baghdad for Sudan and
Yemen Monday as part of a diplomatic offensive by Iraqi officials to
mobilize Arabs against eventual US strikes on their country.
The Iraqi officials' trips are aimed at "exchanging views on ways of
backing the Palestinian intifada and standing up to the threats of
aggression against Iraq," Ramadan, quoted by the official INA news
agency, said before departing.
The visits are also "designed to create a more propitious climate for
the Arab summit due to be held in Beirut" on March 27-28, he said.
Ramadan is the third Iraqi official dispatched by President Saddam
Hussein to lobby for Arab support.
Ezzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of Iraq's ruling Revolution Command
Council (RCC), arrived in Qatar Monday after talks in Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, while Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz has been on a tour of Arab North African states
since Saturday.
The United States has threatened to take military action against Iraq
unless it allows UN arms inspectors back to verify that it no longer
has weapons of mass destruction, but US Vice President Dick Cheney has
found no enthusiasm for a strike during a tour of Arab states which
ended in Kuwait Monday.
Cheney will conclude his regional tour in Turkey, Iraq's northern
neighbour, after visiting Israel.
In remarks published Monday, Ramadan said Iraq might readmit the
inspectors, barred since pulling out in December 1998, if the United
Nations draws up a list of sites and a timetable for inspections.
"Iraq refuses the return of inspectors for as long as the sites for
inspection and a precise timetable are not drawn up," he told the
Saudi-owned daily Asharq Al-Awsat.
Iraq "is totally free of weapons of mass destruction," Ramadan
insisted, suggesting an Arab inspection team could visit any site,
including presidential palaces.
