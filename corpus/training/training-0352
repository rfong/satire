Jakarta shares close 0.8 percent lower 
Indonesian shares closed lower for the fifth consecutive day Friday on
sustained profit-taking, with sentiment depressed by weakness in
regional markets, dealers said.
The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index ended down 4.139 points or
0.8 percent at 525.863 on volume of 292 million shares worth 286.287
billion rupiah (33.3 million dollars).
The rupiah was at 8,625/8,635 to the dollar compared to Thursday's
8,605/8,615.
A dealer with Panin Securities said poor sentiment was partly
attributable to weakness in the regional markets in line with Wall
Street's weak performance.
He said domestic leads such as the announcement of dividends by Indosat
and the fact Telkom failed to boost buying interest had largely been
anticipated.
However, he said the index's decline should not be seen as a sign of
market caution over any fundamentals.
"It is purely profit-taking particularly after the sharp gains last
week," he said.
Telkom was down 50 rupiah at 4,075 while Indosat was down 200 at
11,250.
Gudang Garam was down 150 at 10,050, Sampoerna was down 50 at 4,175 and
Astra International was down 50 at 4,525.
