US Marine helicopter crashes off Mogadishu, killing one person 
A US Marine Corps helicopter crashed into the sea on taking off Sunday
from a warship off Mogadishu, killing one of the five marines on board.
Spokesman Jerry Broeckert said Monday that the pilot of the Huey UH1N
radiod an alarm call as he lifted off the deck of the amphibious
assault ship Essex.
The four survivors suffered only minor injuries, Lieutenant Colonel
Broeckert said.
