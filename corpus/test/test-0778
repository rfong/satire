Narcotics Cases Reach Record High in Thai Courts 
Narcotics cases in Thai courts have reached a historical high and the
trend is still rising, The Nation Monday quoted Criminal Court Chief
Justice Pramot Chapanan as saying.
Narcotics cases had been over-represented in the Criminal Court,
reaching an all-time high of 70 percent of all criminal cases, Pramot
said.
There had been many more cases in 1999 than in any of the previous
years, and the Criminal Court had to increase the number of permanent
benches of judges on drug-related trials from 10 to 14 to cope with the
influx of cases, he noted.
He also expressed support for a proposal of the Office of Narcotics
Control Board to reduce the minimum penalty for retail drug trafficking
from five years to four, which would help speed up cases.
With the minimum penalty for minor drug traffickers reduced to four
years as proposed, the Criminal Procedure Code provides that the court
would not have to summon witnesses for testimony.
Court procedures for such cases would be shorter, and the number of
cases on trial in the courts would be decreased, Pramot said.
However, he also realized that the public may not like this idea.
But he argued that prisons so far are overcrowded with 10,000 convicted
heroin and amphetamine traffickers, none of whom were heads of drug
trafficking syndicates.
Applying harsh punishment to them would not help solve drug abuse
problem in the country, he said.
