Roh happy to be "cut off from world"
The son of jailed disgraced former president Roh Tae-Woo was allowed to
visit him Friday in the prison where he spent his first night on
corruption charges.
"Don't worry about me. I slept well last night," Roh was quoted as
saying by his son, Roh Jae-Hun, who met his father for 100 minutes at
the Seoul Detention House on the outskirts of the city.
"After cutting myself off from the world, I feel comfortable," Roh
Tae-Woo said.
The son said he had brought his father "his favorite Korean history
books, warm socks and underwear and a Hanbok (traditional Korean
robe)."
Yonhap news agency said that on his first day in the cell, Roh was
awakened for roll-call at 6.30am, took morning exercise in an isolated
training ground and ate most of prison breakfast -- a bowl of rice
mixed with barley, pollack soup.
The former head of state is in solitary in a cell that normally holds
16 people, warders said, adding that heating in the jail during the
bitter Korean winter was minimal.
"Probably because of his long life in the military, he is adjusting
quickly to prison life and prison food," a justice ministry official
said.
Roh was jailed on Thursday on charges of receiving 310 million dollars
in bribes from businesses during his five year term of office which
ended in February 1993.
One of his aides was arrested Friday afternoon accused of collecting
bribe money for Roh.
Meanwhile, the government is moving to rewrite laws to suspend honorary
treatment of ex-presidents, beginning with Roh, in the event he is
convicted, Government Adminstration Minister Kim Ki-Jae told
journalists.
Roh was stripped of his privileges -- including his presidential
pension, car and chauffeur and security guards -- when arrested.
Constitutional experts are looking at what special treatment Roh also
qualified for.
