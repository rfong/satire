Kim Basinger Protests Alec Baldwin's Imus-Like Remarks to Daughter
CCN (Crazy Cal News) - Hollywood - Kim Basinger has died her hair red
in protest of ex-husband Alec Baldwin's remarks to their daughter
Ireland. "I can't believe he called her a nappy headed ho," exclaimed
Basinger.
This weekend, Hollywood reacted to the controversial tape: Larry King
told E.T, "It was wrong for him to say a thing like that to his
daughter," while Valerie Bertinelli told us, "I think it was
unfortunate that it was released to the press because I had to
re-schedule my hair appointment."
Alec Baldwin in the voicemail message, Alec is recorded telling
Ireland, "I don't give a damn that you're 12 years old, you looked 15.
Your mother is a thoughtless pain in the a$$ who doesn't care about
what we do together. You have humiliated me for the last time with this
phone sex... This crap you pull on me with this g--damn phone situation
that you would never dream of doing with your mother -- and you do it
to me constantly over and over again. I'm fresh out of Viagra now."
Baldwin goes on to call his daughter "a rude, thoughtless, nappy headed
ho."
Rev. Jackson and Rev. Sharpton were called, but could not be reached
for comment.
