Biotechnology Firms Boom in Belgium 
More and more Belgian companies have entered biotechnological fields,
local media said Tuesday.
About 180 biotechnology firms are operating in Belgium with more than
7,000 employees. The companies have a total annual turnover of more
than 3.3 billion euros (some 3.17 billion U.S. dollars), and have an
annual growth of between 30 percent and 50 percent.
According to data available, over half of these companies are based in
Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region in this country. The Social
Economic Council For Flanders has emphasized the important questions
about biotechnology, in particular those concerning genetically
modified organisms.
The Council also advised the Belgian Parliament to pay attention in its
coming debate on genetic manipulation to the safety of workers in the
biotech sector and to consumer protection.
