British Pows to Seek Compensation from Japan 
The remaining British prisoners of war (POWs) who were held in Japanese
labour camps in World War Two will fight for compensation for their
suffering.
Three representatives of the survivors, who leave for Tokyo on Tuesday,
have vowed to try to get their case to court there, The Times newspaper
said today.
Under a treaty signed in 1951, POWs from Japanese labour camps received
compensation of 76 pounds, equivalent to about 1,000 pounds (1,585 US
dollars) today.
On this visit, they hope to persuade the Japanese authorities to hear a
full court case in April and win 16,000 pounds (25,360 US dollars)
each.
However, lawyers say they have little chance of winning a compensation
claim against Japan. British Prime Minister John Major has told them
his hands are tied by the 1951 treaty.
