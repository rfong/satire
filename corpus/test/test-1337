President Bill Clinton ordered dozens of B-52 bombers and fighter jets
to the Gulf Monday despite Iraq's announcement it was pulling its
troops back from the Kuwaiti border, officials said.
The action came as Clinton was preparing a televised address to the
country from the White House Oval Office.
A senior Pentagon official said the order to send B-52 bombers and
F-15E fighter jets raised to about 350 the number of US aircraft moving
into the Gulf region from US bases in Germany, Italy and other
locations.
