South African President Visits Cuba 
South African President Thabo Mbeki arrived on Monday in Havana for his
first official visit to Cuba. The visit is expected to improve
political relations and economic cooperation between the two countries.
Mbeki was received by Cuban leader Fidel Castro at Havana international
airport.
The South African leader will be decorated with the Order of Marti, the
highest honor for foreign citizens, during his four-day visit.
Mbeki, who participated in last year's Group of 77 summit in Havana, is
expected to hold talks with Castro on Tuesday.
He was also scheduled to speak at Havana University, pay tribute to
national hero Jose Marti and to international Cuban fighters in Africa,
and unveil a bust of Oliver Tambo, a long-time leader of the African
National Congress (ANC), which Mbeki now heads.
The South African delegation, made up of ministers and senior
government officials, was to sign cooperation accords with Cuba in
culture, science and technology, sports and shipping.
Havana and Pretoria established diplomatic relations in 1994 after
black majority rule was established in the country's first all-race
elections.
South Africa maintains close ties with Cuba despite opposition from the
West, especially the United States.
