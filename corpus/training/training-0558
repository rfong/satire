UK Bankers Urge for Clear Government Stand on EMU
The British Bankers Association (BBA), which represents British and
overseas banks based in Britain, is to press the government to put a
clear time frame on Britain's membership of the European Monetary Union
(EMU).
Tim Sweeney, Director-General of the BBA, was quoted by today's
Financial Times as saying: "We have got to be realistic, we are not
necessarily expecting a concrete date, but we would like to see a
narrowing down of options."
The BBA is among several business organizations taking part in an
advisory group, set up by Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown, to investigate the practical implications of the single European
currency due to be implemented on January 1 1999.
British bankers and business leaders regularly complain that
uncertainty created by London's opt-out of the single currency named
euro has impeded efforts to prepare for the EMU.
Business consultants also reported that British companies are among the
worst prepared within the the 15-member European Union.
British banks' wholesale operations will be ready for 1999, but most
have no plans to equip their retail branches with dual currency
handling facilities until the Government has given a firmer indication
about its intentions, the report said.
Bank consultants are warning companies not to risk delaying their EMU
preparations, since inability to handle transactions from January 1
1999 could result in a permanent loss of customers.
