Pakistan rejects "absurd" Indian claim to Azad Kashmir 
Pakistan on Tuesday rejected as "absurd" India's claim of sovereignty
over the part of Kashmir under Islamabad's administrative control.
Foreign office spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said India's claim, repeated
this week by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, was laughable and
hardly justified a serious response.
He also deplored India's "negative" attitude toward resuming dialogue
to defuse the tense military standoff over Kashmir after Vajpayee
rejected Islamabad's latest plea for talks.
The two nuclear rivals have come to the brink of their fourth war since
New Delhi accused Pakistan-based Islamic militants of carrying out an
attack on its parliament on December 13.
"It is unfortunate that the goodwill shown by us, despite all the steps
that we have taken, the response still has been negative," Khan told a
press briefing, referring to Islamabad's crackdown on Islamic
extremists and repeated calls for dialogue.
"Absurd excuses are sometimes being made not to come to the talks. All
that we can say is that we will remain patient and steadfast to settle
all issues."
Military spokesman Major General Rashid Qureshi also rejected as absurd
reports that India wanted any talks on the future of the divided
Himalayan state to discuss handing over Pakistan-administered Kashmir
to India.
Vajpayee said Monday said any future talks on Kashmir would have to
involve the issue of handing over "Pakistan-occupied Kashmir" to India.
"Kashmir is an integral part of India and we have a legal and
constitutional right over it."
Islamabad claims Kashmir is the unfinished business of the partition of
the subcontinent in 1947. It believes the Muslim majority population
should vote on whether to join India or Pakistan as suggested in
decades-old UN resolutions.
New Delhi however lays its claim to the picturesque but impoverished
region on the basis of an accession agreement signed with the Kashmiri
maharaja in 1947 as Pakistani tribesmen invaded the state.
On Saturday Musharraf sent a message to Vajpayee marking India's annual
Republic Day, saying he wanted "good neighbourly relations" with India.
"I would like to reiterate our readiness to engage in a serious and
sustained dialogue with India to commence together a journey of peace
and progress," he said.
But Vajpayee's response was terse and negative.
"Our neighbour keeps inviting us for meetings and talks but I ask them,
what do we do with the meeting if we have to meet to fight once again?
It is better to remain separate," Vajpayee was quoted as saying by the
Press Trust of India.
