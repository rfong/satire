Mandela rules out intervention in trial of generals 
President Nelson Mandela Wednesday ruled out intervening in an
impending murder trial of former defence
minister Magnus Malan and 10 apartheid-era military officers.
"We accept the principle of the separation of power, the separation of
the government and the judiciary," Mandela told reporters on his
arrival at a local government election polling station in this black
township near Pretoria.
"I am not prepared to intervene in this case," he added to cheers from
supporters of his ruling African National Congress (ANC) queuing to
vote in South Africa's first all-race local government elections.
Malan and the retired top officers, among them four generals and a vice
admiral, are to be formally arrested and charged with murder on
Thursday in Durban in eastern KwaZulu-Natal province.
The officers, including former defence force chiefs Jannie Geldenhuys
and Kat Liebenberg, are accused of helping form a paramilitary force to
aid the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in its bitter
feuding with the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal, which has claimed more than
14,000 lives since 1985.
The leader of the white right-wing Freedom Front, Constand Viljoen,
meanwhile, said he will Wednesday bring an urgent court action in the
KwaZulu-Natal capital Pietermaritzburg in a bid to halt Thursday's
trial.
Viljoen said in a radio interview that he was bringing the action "in
the interests of the constitution."
"We think this case relates to conflicts of the past with a political
content," he said. "You had on the one side the African National
Congress (ANC) fighting a revolutionary war and on the other side the
KwaZulu government and the then South African government."
"We believe the amnesty provided for in the constitution is
applicable," Viljoen added. "We maintain the prosecutions are not in
the interests of national unity and should be dealt with first by the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission before going to the criminal
courts."
On Tuesday, ANC secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa said the accused in
the trial can apply for amnesty from the commission, which is due to be
set up early next year.
But Viljoen, who headed the South African military from 1980 until
1985, said he was anxious that the former military leaders not be
subjected to a public trial, which he said was part of the ANC's
"psychological war" against the white rightwing.
"We are asking for a postponement of this case for a ruling by the
Constitutional Court as to whether this is in line with the
constitution or not," he said.
Asked to comment on Viljoen's action, Mandela said that if the
rightwing leader succeeds in his application, "I will be satisfied the
ordinary process of law has been followed."
