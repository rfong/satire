UK/NNP Business/NNP Failures/NNP on/IN Rise/NN Business/NN failures/NNS in/IN Britain/NNP have/VBP increased/VBN to/TO their/PRP$ highest/JJS level/NN in/IN seven/CD years/NNS ,/, as/IN a/DT new/JJ survey/NN showed/VBD that/IN 11,741/CD firms/NNS went/VBD bust/NN in/IN the/DT three/CD months/NNS July/NNP to/TO September/NNP ,/, the/DT worst/JJS figure/NN since/IN 16,000/CD failed/VBD in/IN the/DT Summer/NNPS of/IN 1992/CD ./.

``/`` Although/IN there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT rise/NN in/IN business/NN confidence/NN amongst/IN almost/RB all/DT sectors/NNS of/IN the/DT economy/NN ,/, these/DT figures/NNS illustrate/VBP the/DT downside/NN of/IN the/DT very/RB tight/JJ profit/NN margins/NNS under/IN which/WDT many/JJ companies/NNS are/VBP having/VBG to/TO operate/VB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Philip/NNP Mellor/NNP ,/, senior/JJ analyst/NN at/IN Dun/NNP &/CC Bradstreet/NNP ,/, which/WDT undertook/VBD the/DT survey/NN ./.

The/DT number/NN of/IN business/NN failures/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN accelerating/VBG ,/, with/IN the/DT underlying/VBG rate/NN rising/VBG by/IN 13.2/CD percent/NN for/IN the/DT nine/CD months/NNS of/IN this/DT year/NN ,/, compared/VBN to/TO 10.7/JJ percent/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ six/CD months/NNS of/IN the/DT year/NN ./.

So/IN far/RB this/DT year/NN ,/, 33,000/CD businesses/NNS have/VBP failed/VBN ,/, about/IN 850/CD every/DT week/NN ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT survey/NN ./.

Although/IN the/DT UK/NNP economy/NN is/VBZ now/RB improving/VBG ,/, with/IN economic/JJ growth/NN predicted/VBN to/TO reach/VB 1.5/CD percent/NN this/DT year/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN pricing/NN pressures/NNS are/VBP putting/VBG many/JJ firms/NNS '/POS profits/NNS at/IN risk/NN ./.

With/IN inflation/NN at/IN 2.1/CD percent/NN ,/, companies/NNS are/VBP finding/VBG that/IN customers/NNS are/VBP refusing/VBG to/TO pay/VB higher/JJR prices/NNS in/IN the/DT shops/NNS ./.

Recent/JJ surveys/NNS of/IN business/NN confidence/NN suggest/VBP that/IN most/RBS British/JJ companies/NNS are/VBP becoming/VBG more/RBR optimistic/JJ about/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP strong/JJ regional/JJ variations/NNS in/IN the/DT rate/NN of/IN business/NN failure/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT relatively/RB prosperous/JJ South-East/NN contrasting/VBG with/IN high/JJ rates/NNS of/IN failure/NN in/IN Wales/NNP ,/, the/DT Midlands/NNPS ,/, and/CC the/DT North-East/NN ./.

In/IN London/NNP there/EX was/VBD actually/RB a/DT decline/NN in/IN business/NN failures/NNS ,/, with/IN 4.8/CD percent/NN fewer/JJR firms/NNS going/VBG bust/NN ./.
