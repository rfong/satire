McEnroe Wins Seniors Title
The American added the Melbourne Park event to his win in Sydney a week
earlier when he overpowered South African-born Kriek in straight sets
7-5, 6-3.
The crucial break for McEnroe came from a line call at 5-5 in the first
set with Kriek on game point. McEnroe's return was called out but he
complained and Kriek offered to replay the point.
McEnroe won the point and was then unstoppable.
McEnroe extended his winning record over Kriek to 21-7, which includes
12-5 on the ATP Tour and 9-2 on the seniors circuit. Kriek was playing
in his 20th final but slumped to a 2-18 record.
