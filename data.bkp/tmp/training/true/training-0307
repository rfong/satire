The/DT 29-year-old/JJ Australian/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN plagued/VBN by/IN injuries/NNS since/IN his/PRP$ Wimbledon/NNP triumph/NN in/IN 1987/CD and/CC underwent/VBD back/RP surgery/NN 11/CD months/NNS ago/RB ./.

He/PRP underlined/VBD he/PRP is/VBZ serious/JJ about/IN his/PRP$ latest/JJS return/NN to/TO the/DT courts/NNS with/IN a/DT pair/NN of/IN impressive/JJ victories/NNS Sunday/NNP at/IN the/DT Hopman/NNP Cup/NNP teams/NNS event/NN at/IN the/DT Burswood/NNP Superdome/NNP ./.

Cash/NNP downed/VBD Christo/NNP van/NNP Rensburg/NNP 7-5/CD ,/, 6-2/CD in/IN the/DT men/NNS 's/POS singles/NNS and/CC he/PRP and/CC Kristine/NNP Radford/NNP then/RB beat/VBD Van/NNP Rensburg/NNP and/CC Amanda/NNP Coetzer/NNP 7-6/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- 7-2/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, 7-6/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 11-9/CD -RRB-/-RRB- as/IN Australia/NNP defeated/VBD seventh-seeded/JJ South/NNP Africa/NNP 2-1/NNP in/IN a/DT first-round/JJ match/NN ./.

Cash/NNP said/VBD the/DT ballet/NN exercises/NNS helped/VBD him/PRP strengthen/VB his/PRP$ back/NN ,/, while/IN the/DT new/JJ service/NN action/NN aims/VBZ at/IN putting/VBG less/JJR pressure/NN on/IN the/DT problem/NN area/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB actually/RB dancing/NN or/CC anything/NN like/IN that/DT ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT exercise/NN routine/JJ that/IN the/DT ballet/NN dancers/NNS do/VBP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ basically/RB keeping/VBG up/RP the/DT strength/NN work/NN and/CC the/DT stretching/NN exercises/VBZ to/TO get/VB me/PRP mobile/JJ again/RB ./. ''/''

Cash/NNP said/VBD his/PRP$ serve/NN now/RB involves/VBZ less/JJR twisting/NN ./.

``/`` To/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP had/VBD n't/RB been/VBN through/IN some/DT inconsistent/JJ periods/NNS with/IN my/PRP$ other/JJ serve/NN would/MD be/VB lying/VBG ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP every/DT player/NN has/VBZ problems/NNS with/IN their/PRP$ serve/NN ,/, but/CC as/RB far/RB as/IN power/NN goes/VBZ ,/, I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ now/RB as/RB powerful/JJ ,/, if/IN not/RB more/RBR powerful/JJ ./.

``/`` I/PRP 've/VBP done/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN studying/VBG and/CC video/JJ analysis/NN of/IN my/PRP$ serve/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT serves/NN of/IN other/JJ players/NNS ,/, to/TO help/VB me/PRP visualize/VB the/DT right/JJ way/NN to/TO serve/VB ./.

``/`` It/PRP might/MD not/RB look/VB that/DT obvious/JJ to/TO most/JJS people/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT quite/RB significant/JJ change/NN ./. ''/''

Cash/NN ,/, who/WP led/VBD Australia/NNP to/TO two/CD Davis/NNP Cup/NNP titles/NNS ,/, said/VBD he/PRP still/RB is/VBZ a/DT long/JJ way/NN from/IN his/PRP$ best/JJS ./.

``/`` I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN working/VBG like/IN a/DT slave/NN to/TO get/VB back/RB and/CC things/NNS are/VBP going/VBG well/RB so/RB far/RB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` The/DT object/NN is/VBZ to/TO start/VB playing/VBG these/DT -LRB-/-LRB- top/JJ -RRB-/-RRB- guys/NNS ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ obviously/RB very/RB exciting/JJ for/IN me/PRP to/TO start/VB playing/VBG them/PRP again/RB --/: at/IN least/JJS being/VBG in/IN the/DT tournaments/NNS with/IN them/PRP ./.

``/`` Maybe/RB you/PRP lose/VBP the/DT first/JJ round/NN a/DT few/JJ times/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB matter/VB as/RB long/RB as/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN there/RB ./.

``/`` The/DT goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO keep/VB improving/VBG and/CC stay/VB injury-free/JJ ,/, and/CC if/IN you/PRP do/VBP that/IN you/PRP 'll/MD play/VB good/JJ tennis/NN ./. ''/''

Cash/NNP 's/POS current/JJ comeback/NN is/VBZ his/PRP$ third/JJ since/IN his/PRP$ Wimbledon/NNP triumph/NN --/: and/CC he/PRP says/VBZ he/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR determined/JJ than/IN ever/RB ./.

``/`` With/IN my/PRP$ back/NN they/PRP wrote/VBD me/PRP off/RP and/CC I/PRP came/VBD back/RB ,/, and/CC after/IN my/PRP$ Achilles/NNP injury/NN they/PRP wrote/VBD me/PRP off/RP and/CC I/PRP came/VBD back/RB ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP people/NNS are/VBP going/VBG to/TO run/VB out/RP of/IN ink/NN before/IN I/PRP disappear/VBP ./. ''/''
