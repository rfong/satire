Tomba shrugs off legal worries to win slalom 
Italian Alberto Tomba, shrugged off his legal problems to win his first
World Cup race of the year by taking the slalom here on Tuesday.
Tomba, who risks charges after attacking a photographer last Sunday
following his third place finish in the giant slalom, had a combined
time of 1min 34.62secs.
France's Yves Dimier was second with 1:36.17 and Italy's Konrad
Ladstatter third in 1:36.56.
Norway's Lasse Kjus was initially awarded third but was later
disqualfied for having missed a gate towards the end of the second run.
It was a stunning performance by Tomba who was celebrating his 29th
birthday.
Lying third after the first run the Italian, who has had a miserable
start to the season, suddenly showed the formed that saw him sweep the
World Cup last season.
His victory gave him his 30th World Cup slamom win and hios third on
the Madonna piste.
Shortly before the race began Italian police confirmed they were
investigating Sunday's incident when a press photographer was cut on
the hand when he was hit by a glass trophy thrown by Tomba.
Tomba insists it was an accident but the photographer, Aldo Martinuzzi,
claims the Italian aimed at him and has lodged a formal complaint.
Tomba fell out with Martinuzzi, a freelance, when he snapped
full-frontal nude photos of him in a Swiss sauna which were published
in an Italian magazine last year
