Circumcised immigrant takes Rabin's name 
A new Jewish immigrant has adopted the name of Israel's assassinated
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin under a religious rite after undergoing
circumcision.
The Jerusalem Post said Tuesday that Russian immigrant Luzav Alexander,
27, asked that his name be changed when the doctor asked him to recite
the "kiddush" in which the name of the circumcised man is stated.
"'Yitzhak will continue to live in Israel,' he said in halting Hebrew,
stirring the small crowd at the ceremony" on Monday in the northern
town of Safed, on Rabin's burial day, the paper reported.
Tel Aviv mayor Ronni Milo, meanwhile, plans to rename Kings of Israel
square, where Rabin was assassinated at a peace rally on Saturday,
after the slain premier, the paper said.
