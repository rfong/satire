Milosevic Dreams He's Slaughtering Ethnic Albanians In His Underwear
In an incident he described as "really freaky," Serbian president Slobodan
Milosevic dreamed he was ordering the slaughter of tens of thousands of
Kosovars while clad only in his underwear Tuesday. "Everything in the dream
was totally normal, except, for some reason, I wasn't wearing any clothes,"
Milosevic said. "At one point, I was trying to think of a way to excuse
myself to go home and get dressed, but I had to stay and order the mass
execution of 2,400 villagers in the border town of Podujevo." Last Friday,
Milosevic dreamed he was taking an exam with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
on a mound of bodies near the Macedonian border.
