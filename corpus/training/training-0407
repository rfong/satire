Czech Government Devotes to Rebuilding Flood-Hit Areas 
The Czech government adopted a series of measures Wednesday to help the
flood-hit areas resume production and rebuild homes, a government
spokesman said today.
Minister of Environmental Protection Jiri Skalicky was sent to
supervise the work of the flood relief mission.
The spokesman said that the government will issue 1 billion korun
(about 303 million U.S. dollars) of state bonds to aid the flooded
areas.
He said every flood-hit county will get an aid of 23 million korun
(about 697,000 dollars), and each house-losing family can receive
150,000 korun (about 4,545 dollars) from the government as well as
850,000 korun (about 25,758 dollars) of low interest loans to rebuild
their house.
Since early July, the floods, triggered by continuous torrential rains
in the eastern part of the Czech Republic, have led to 46 deaths and
massive property damage.
