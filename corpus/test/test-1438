Anhui Province Uses World Bank Loans for Expressway 
East China's Anhui Province today began construction of a
153-kilometer-long expressway linking its capital Hefei with another
major city, Anqing.
The project will cost 3.7 billion yuan (about 450 million U.S.
dollars), including 200 million U.S. dollars in loans from the World
Bank, the first time Anhui will use loans from the international
organization for local highway construction.
The expressway, which is part of the country's major highway which will
run from Shanghai to Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province in the
Southwest, is expected to open to traffic in June 2002.
In recent years, the province has used 420 million U.S. dollars of
overseas investment to build highways.
During the 1996-2000 period, the province will spend 20 billion yuan to
add 5,000 kilometers to its highway network, including 650 kilometers
of expressways. As much as 30 percent of this huge cost will be covered
by overseas funds.
