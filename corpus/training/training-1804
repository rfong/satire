Thai socialites won't risk reputations to expose conmen 
A senior Thai police officer has appealed to the wealthy, high-society
victims of a gang that has worked the same scam for five years to come
forward and lodge complaints, a local newspaper said Sunday.
The conmen send letters to social notables inviting them to receive
fake honorary degrees from famous US universities at no cost, The
Nation daily said, citing the commander of the police Economic Crime
Suppression Division.
But before the degrees are to be awarded, the gang asks for
100,000-800,000 baht (4,000-32,000 dollars) for the cost of hotel rooms
and receptions, the daily said.
None of the hundreds of victims have filed a complaint with the police
as it could damage their reputations, police Major General Pipop na
Ranong was cited as saying, so the culprits remain at large.
