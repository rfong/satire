Talks on ADB Loan for Nepali Road Project Start 
The Nepalese government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) began
negotiations here today on a proposed loan of 40 million US dollars for
a road improvement project in this country.
The project is to upgrade about 250 kilometers of highways in the
country's far-western, mid-western and eastern regions to all-weather
standards starting from 1996, according to the Ministry of Finance.
The proposed project would also provide rehabilitation and periodic
maintenance for high priority feeder roads of some 100 kilometers in
various regions of the kingdom, the ministry said.
These roads connect farming communities to the main roads and market
centers, and their rehabilitation would help alleviate poverty in
isolated agricultural areas.
According to the ministry, the proposed ADB loan will be repaid within
40 years with a grace period of 10 years. The loan will have a one
percent service charge.
The Asian Development Bank has been supporting the Nepalese government
in the transport sector since 1972.
