AFC Discontent on Postponing World Club Championship 
The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Tuesday expressed its
displeasure over the decision by world football governing body FIFA to
postpone the 2001 World Club Championship until 2003.
Peter Velappan, the general secretary of AFC said that the AFC is
"deeply disappointed" with the postponement of the championship that
was due to be held in Spain in July and August.
The tournament, which features the champions of each continent, is
believed to have been axed because of problems attracting sponsorship.
