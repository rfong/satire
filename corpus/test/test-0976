Western Xia Dynasty Relics Found in Ningxia 
Remains of buildings and shards of porcelain dating from the Western
Xia Dynasty (1038-1227) have been found in this capital of northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
Chinese archeologists say that the relics will contribute to the study
of the layout of the capital of the dynasty, which was set up by the
nomadic Dangxiang tribe.
"The find is the first material proof that the capital of the dynasty
was located on the site of present-day Yinchuan," said Xu Cheng,
director of the Regional Institute of Archeology.
According to Xu, the Western Xia capital ruins are hard to find because
the city was submerged by the silt-filled Yellow River when the Mongols
destroyed a dam on the river.
The building remains were found at the construction site of a new
telecommunications building.
