Andean Environment Conference Opens in Quito 
Ministers of finance, energy and environment of the Andean Community
countries met here Thursday to discuss environment protection in the
Amazon region.
Ecuador's Environment Minister Yolanda Kakabadse said the techniques
used by petroleum companies to exploit crude and the application of
sophisticated mechanisms have done a lot of damage to the environment,
specially to the east of Ecuador and its surroundings.
At the two-day conference, representatives will work out a series of
policies to protect the regional environment affected by petroleum
exploration.
The Andean Community is composed of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru
and Venezuela.
