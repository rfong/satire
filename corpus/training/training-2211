Denmark gives aid to UN agency helping Palestinians 
Denmark will give just over a million euros in aid to support a UN
agency working to help Palestinian refugees living in the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank, Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller said Wednesday.
The 1.07 million euros (936,500 US dollars) will go to the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA).
In a statement, Moeller said the humanitarian situation in the
Palestinian territories had deteriorated to the point that half of
Palestinians live below the poverty line, unemployment is high and
health care has worsened.
Moeller said it was "essential" to try to help the Palestinians "who
want nothing more than peace and calm and the chance of a normal life".
In January Denmark urged Israel to lift its blockade of the Palestinian
territories, saying the creation of a Palestinian state would help
Israel find security.
