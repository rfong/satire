China to Make New Breakthroughs in Enterprise Reform (2)
Currently, China has over 14,500 large and medium-sized state
enterprises and over 300,000 small ones, according to the official.
China plans to standardize large and medium-sized state firms by
clarifying the investors and multiplying the share-holding rights, and
to encourage non-banking institutions and legal persons including
non-government companies to join in the restructuring of state
enterprises.
The majority of state firms will be turned into limited companies,
while large and medium-sized key state companies are expected to adopt
the modern enterprise system by the end of the century.
Meanwhile, the state will encourage the establishment of trans-regional
and trans-industrial, large enterprise groups through stock-holding,
based on the capital and adopting market mechanism.
On the other hand, the state will withdraw its capital from small state
firms gradually to let them compete on the market, the official said.
He noted that the government will change its method of control over the
enterprises by adopting the system of investorship, so as to realize an
effective supervision and control over state properties, and the
mechanism of operation and value-increasing mechanism.
Meanwhile, efforts will be made to improve the system of legal person
properties, to create a mechanism for enterprises to compete on an
equal footing, while the employment system will also be improved, so as
to let workers find a job through mutual selection. In addition,
enterprise leaders should be selected through competition.
