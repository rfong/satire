Ugly/JJ scrap/NN over/IN ECB/NNP top/JJ job/NN could/MD bruise/VB euro/NN An/DT ugly/JJ scrap/NN for/IN the/DT top/JJ job/NN at/IN the/DT European/NNP Central/NNP Bank/NNP could/MD also/RB bruise/VB the/DT euro/NN ,/, but/CC economists/NNS say/VBP the/DT new/JJ chief/NN is/VBZ unlikely/JJ to/TO be/VB as/RB unpopular/JJ with/IN the/DT market/NN as/IN outgoing/JJ Wim/NNP Duisenberg/NNP ./.

Few/JJ tears/NNS were/VBD shed/VBN among/IN currency/NN dealers/NNS on/IN Thursday/NNP after/IN the/DT gaffe-prone/JJ Dutch/JJ banker/NN said/VBD he/PRP would/MD step/VB down/RP as/IN president/NN of/IN the/DT ECB/NN in/IN July/NNP 2003/CD ,/, and/CC the/DT euro/NN perked/VBD up/RP to/TO 0.8679/CD dollars/NNS from/IN 0.8650/CD dollars/NNS shortly/RB before/IN ./.

A/DT decision/NN by/IN the/DT ECB/NN to/TO leave/VB interest/NN rates/NNS unchanged/JJ at/IN 3.25/CD percent/NN shortly/RB afterwards/RB also/RB drew/VBD a/DT muted/JJ response/NN ./.

In/IN late/JJ trade/NN ,/, the/DT European/JJ single/JJ currency/NN was/VBD at/IN 0.8679/CD dollars/NNS ,/, while/IN the/DT dollar/NN fetched/VBD 133.74/CD yen/NNS ./.

Things/NNS could/MD get/VB more/RBR interesting/JJ for/IN the/DT market/NN as/IN contenders/NNS for/IN a/DT replacement/NN emerge/VBP from/IN the/DT wings/NNS ./.

Duisenberg/NNP 's/POS appointment/NN and/CC the/DT birth/NN of/IN the/DT ECB/NN were/VBD marred/VBN by/IN a/DT bitter/JJ row/NN with/IN France/NNP ,/, which/WDT had/VBD at/IN the/DT last/JJ minute/NN tried/VBN to/TO push/VB through/IN Jean-Claude/NNP Trichet/NNP ,/, the/DT head/NN of/IN the/DT French/JJ central/JJ bank/NN ,/, as/IN an/DT alternative/JJ candidate/NN ./.

Most/JJS bets/NNS are/VBP on/IN Trichet/NNP to/TO succeed/VB Duisenberg/NNP ./.

But/CC Trichet/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN dogged/VBN by/IN an/DT investigation/NN into/IN his/PRP$ role/NN in/IN the/DT near-collapse/NN of/IN the/DT previously/RB state-owned/JJ bank/NN Credit/NNP Lyonnais/NNP in/IN the/DT early/JJ 1990s/NNS ,/, when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD a/DT finance/NN ministry/NN official/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT risk/NN is/VBZ clearly/RB that/IN the/DT Trichet/NNP investigation/NN continues/VBZ to/TO run/VB on/RP sufficiently/RB long/RB that/IN effectively/RB he/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO take/VB the/DT post/NN next/JJ year/NN anyway/RB ,/, in/IN which/WDT case/NN then/RB it/PRP certainly/RB starts/VBZ raising/VBG big/JJ questions/NNS as/IN to/TO who/WP will/MD take/VB over/RP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Jeremy/NNP Hawkins/NNP ,/, an/DT economist/NN at/IN Bank/NNP of/IN America/NNP ./.

Other/JJ possible/JJ contenders/NNS include/VBP ECB/NNP vice/NN president/NN Christian/NNP Noyer/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ to/TO resign/VB at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN May/NNP ,/, French/NNP Finance/NNP Minister/NNP Laurent/NNP Fabius/NNP ,/, Luxembourg/NNP 's/POS prime/JJ minister/NN and/CC finance/NN minister/NN Jean-Claude/NNP Juncker/NNP and/CC Belgian/JJ finance/NN minister/NN Didier/NNP Reynolds/NNP ./.

Jane/NNP Foley/NNP ,/, an/DT economist/NN at/IN Barclays/NNP Capital/NNP ,/, said/VBD that/IN any/DT public/JJ tussle/NN over/IN the/DT presidency/NN could/MD hurt/VB the/DT standing/NN of/IN the/DT ECB/NN ,/, saying/VBG the/DT euro-zone/JJ central/JJ banks/NNS ``/`` do/VBP need/VBP to/TO build/VB up/RP their/PRP$ credibility/NN ./.

She/PRP told/VBD AFP/NNP :/: ``/`` Duisenberg/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB the/DT same/JJ weight/NN as/IN -LRB-/-LRB- US/NNP Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP chief/NN -RRB-/-RRB- Alan/NNP Greenspan/NNP or/CC even/RB Eddie/NNP George/NNP and/CC the/DT Bank/NNP of/IN England/NNP has/VBZ ,/, so/IN anything/NN that/WDT could/MD be/VB potentially/RB negative/JJ to/TO credibility/NN could/MD potentially/RB also/RB be/VB a/DT euro-negative/JJ factor/NN ./.

Yet/CC whoever/JJ lands/NNS the/DT job/NN would/MD unlikely/RB be/VB less/RBR popular/JJ in/IN the/DT market/NN than/IN Duisenberg/NNP ./.

His/PRP$ verbal/JJ gaffes/NNS and/CC the/DT ECB/NN 's/POS timid/JJ monetary/JJ policy/NN have/VBP been/VBN factors/NNS behind/IN the/DT euro/NN 's/POS steady/JJ decline/NN since/IN its/PRP$ birth/NN in/IN 1999/CD ./.

``/`` Duisenberg/NNP is/VBZ n't/RB a/DT particular/JJ favorite/NN anyway/RB so/RB from/IN that/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN it/PRP 's/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO expect/VB that/IN the/DT market/NN 's/VBZ going/VBG to/TO get/VB very/RB disappointed/JJ that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB someone/NN else/RB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Foley/NNP ./.

``/`` If/IN he/PRP were/VBD to/TO stay/VB on/RB longer/RB ,/, a/LS -RRB-/-RRB- it/PRP would/MD just/RB be/VB negative/JJ for/IN the/DT markets/NNS in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB Duisenberg/NNP anyway/RB ,/, and/CC b/LS -RRB-/-RRB- I/PRP suppose/VBP it/PRP would/MD be/VB negative/JJ in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/IN it/PRP suggests/VBZ that/IN they/PRP 're/VBP having/VBG real/JJ problems/NNS trying/VBG to/TO find/VB someone/NN to/TO replace/VB him/PRP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Hawkins/NNP ./.
