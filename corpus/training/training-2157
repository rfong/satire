Bangladesh to Export Gas, Crude Oil
According to official sources, the proposal made by the Energy Ministry
was approved Thursday by the task force at its meeting chaired by the
Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael Ahmed.
The meeting was attended by concerned officials and representatives of
the private sector who took stock of the country's export performance
and discussed the problems relating to expansion of exports.
No detail about the proposal was available yet. It was learnt that
donors, the world bank in particular, favor Bangladesh's export of gas,
arguing that the country is rich in natural gas reserve and opening up
of gas export would encourage more overseas investment in the energy
sector.
