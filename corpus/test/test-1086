UN delegation leaves NKorea after inspection trip 
A UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs delegation left Pyongyang
Saturday after touring flood-hit areas to guage the seriousness of
North Korea's food shortages, the North's media said.
The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the delegation had
"consulted with representatives of international organisations and made
preparations to call for new international cooperation in food,
agriculture, medical service and other domains."
The KCNA report, monitored here, gave no further details.
The UN visit came on the heels of a similar mission last week by the UN
World Food Progam (WFP) and amid reports that Pyongyang had demanded
food aid guarantees as a pre-condition for entering peace talks with
the South.
Both Washington and Seoul, which have been major donors to the North in
the past three years, have told North Korea in talks in New York that
guarantees can be discussed once it comes to the negotiating table.
North Korea's economy has shrivelled since the collapse of the
communist block and Chinese market reforms cut it off from
virtually-free "fraternal aid," and UN agencies have said the country's
22 million people are sapped by chronic malnutrition.
