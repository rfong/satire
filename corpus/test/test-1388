India's Trade Deficit Down in April-July 
India's trade deficit in April-July this year stood at 1.08 billion
U.S. dollars, lower than the 1.5 billion dollars gap in the
corresponding period last year, official sources said here today.
Trade in April-July was marked by a sharp deceleration in imports and a
slow down in export growth compared with June as well as the first four
months of the previous year.
India's exports in April-July were about 10.8 billion dollars, up by
11.45 percent over the same period last year.
While imports in this period stood at 11.92 billion dollars, 5.95
percent higher than the same period last year. This is mainly on
account of a far sharper rise in oil imports valued at 3 billion
dollars, an increase of almost 42 percent over the corresponding period
last year.
The trade deficit for the year 1995-96 stood at 4.53 billion dollars,
with exports growing at the rate of 21.28 percent and imports at 28.74
percent.
