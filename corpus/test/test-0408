Access to Samashky; Refugees Bring Tales of Woe 
Relief officials and journalists were denied access for a fourth day
Monday to the village of Samashky in western Chechnya, while refugees
alleged atrocities there by Russian troops.
``I'm suspicious that a few things are going on there, as they do not
let us enter,'' said Jean Corboz, field coordinator for the
International Committee for the Red Cross in Chechnya.
Samashky, 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of the Chechen capital Grozny,
has been a flashpoint of separatist resistance and site of a brutal
assault by federal forces over the weekend.
Attempts by aid workers and reporters to enter the village have ended
at a checkpoint about a mile west of it. Interior Ministry troops said
they had orders not to let any outsiders pass.
Corboz argued in vain that he had permission from the Russian military
commander in Chechnya, Lt. Gen. Anatoly Kulikov, to travel throughout
the breakaway republic.
The atmosphere at the checkpoint was tense after women who had walked
out of Samashky clutching a few belongings and their children's hands
tearfully recounted the storming of the village.
``Bring us medicines -- there are wounded lying in their houses,''
cried 32-year-old Yakha Alpatova, stumbling with grief. ``Nobody is
helping us. We haven't eaten for three days.''
Alpatova said her father and aunt were killed when troops hurled a hand
grenade into the cellar where the family was taking cover from an air
and artillery bombardment Friday and Saturday.
``They gave us no warning -- they just threw the grenade in,'' she
said.
Zelay Arkhiyeva, 30, said she saw two old men approach Russian troops
to ask for drinking water.
``They fired 30 or 40 bullets into them,'' she said, tears running down
her cheeks. ``You'd think two bullets would have been enough.''
Stone-faced young soldiers sitting atop an armored vehicle watched the
grief-stricken women, some carrying white flags.
No men walked out of Samashky on Monday. Arkhiyeva said her husband had
been detained along with many other village men.
A truck later brought out 15 village women wounded by shrapnel and
bullets, taking them to a hospital. Two helicopters arrived to pick up
a wounded Russian serviceman.
``You talk about genocide but look what's happening to us,'' an
Interior Ministry soldier muttered, looking at his wounded comrade.
Two buses packed with Chechen women were allowed back into the village
to find and bury the dead. Villagers who left Samashky on Monday said
there were many corpses lying in cellars and in the streets.
Russian military officials claim to have killed 130 rebel fighters and
captured 124 in the offensive. A military spokesman in Chechnya, Col.
Vladimir Komarov, said another 44 were seized Sunday in a forest east
of Samashky.
In a statement carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency, he did not respond
to the refugees' allegations.
Chechen Information Minister Movladi Udugov said Sunday that only 28
rebels had been killed and 700 villagers, about 300 of them in a forest
as they attempted to flee.
None of the figures could be independently confirmed. Both sides in the
Chechen conflict routinely distort casualty reports.
Russian troops entered the rebel republic Dec. 11 to quash its
independence movement. As many as 25,000 people have been killed,
according to some accounts. Hundreds of thousands have fled their
homes.
Moscow's forces now control much of Chechnya but resistance continues
to flare in several areas. Another rebel stronghold, Shaami-Yurt, east
of Samashky, fell Sunday evening, according to the military command.
