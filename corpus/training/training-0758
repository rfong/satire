Man's Body Found In Trunk In Atlantic
A fisherman trolling the waters of the Atlantic Ocean 29 miles south of
Fire Island early Tuesday found the body of a man floating in a large
plastic utility trunk, Suffolk County police said.
The body was described as that of an man in his mid-30s, weighing about
190 pounds. It was fully clothed but without any identification, said
Petty Officer Dennis Uhlenhopp, a spokesman for the Coast Guard.
The trunk was spotted by an unidentified fisherman aboard the trawler
Carol Lee in international waters about 6:10 a.m. The discovery was
reported to the Coast Guard, which sent a boat and helicopter to
transport the body to the Coast Guard station at Fire Island Inlet.
Police said they had listed the case as an apparent homicide; the body
had been removed to the Suffolk County Medical Examiner's Office for a
post-mortem examination to determine the cause of death.
Uhlenhopp said indications were the body had been in the water for a
day and a half to two days. He said there were no visible signs of
severe trauma.
He described the plastic trunk that held the body as black, measuring 2
feet by 3 feet. ``It's a type of tool carrier one might find in the
back of a pickup truck,'' he said.
Late Tuesday a spokesman for the FBI said the agency was assuming
jurisdiction for the case because it was considered a ``crime on the
high seas.'' Suffolk police said they had received no reports of
missing persons in the last several days.
