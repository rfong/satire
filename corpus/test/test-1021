Monthly Interbank Forex Transactions Down 
Interbank foreign exchange trading volume fell to 2.47 billion US
dollars in February, according to statistics released by the
Shanghai-based China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The drop in trading is due to a week-long holiday during the year's
Spring Festival which began on February 5.
The total included 2.41 million US dollars, 203 million Hong Kong
dollars and 3.657 billion Japanese yen.
The weighted average exchange rate of the US dollar hit 2.878 yuan at
the end of February, and the Hong Kong dollar ended the month at 1.0632
yuan, down nine points from January, with the yuan- yen rate standing
at 7.5138:100, down 0.2447 points.
