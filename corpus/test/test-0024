Two Donors Hold Back Funds For Children In Uganda 
Save the Children Fund of the United Kingdom and Save the Children
Norway have suspended funding the National Council of Children (NCC) in
Uganda.
They are blaming the Ugandan government for failing to present the
children and the national council for children bills to Parliament.
the two organization, according to the local news media here today,
said they were suspending funding for the NCC secretariat until the
laws were passed by the parliament.
The donors' main concern is the absence of a law to alleviate the
situation of children in the post-war Uganda.
The donors said the two bills to protect Uganda's children and
establish an overseeing body were drafted more than a year ago but had
failed to reach the floor in the National Resistance Council for debate
and passage.
The two organizations, which together with the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) are major donors to the child advocacy
initiative of the NCC, have said they will support district
administrations for local child advocacy and planning activities.
They stressed that NCC should be legally established in order to have
bank account where the funds should be channelled.
The reports said Save the Children Fund of UK spent about 21,000 US
dollars on NCC activities last year and about 35,700 dollars was
earmarked for this year.
Save the Children Norway spent about 60,000 dollars last year.
The two donor representatives said the laws whose bills were drafted by
the Child Law Review Committee established in 1991 to revise children's
laws should be in place by now.
