Santer attacks US over Cuba sanctions 
European Commission President Jacques Santer reiterated Thursday EU
protests over US sanctions against Cuba, warning that Europe-US
relations could be threatened.
Speaking before the start of the G7 Lyon summit, he said he hoped US
President Bill Clinton would listen to the protests "in the interest of
good relations."
"I hope they will show more flexibility. In the interest of good
relations we should be able to achieve that. Our protest will be
heard," he said, calling the US sanctions "unilateral and
extra-territorial."
Washingon has come under pressure from its G7 partners over the
so-called Helms-Burton law, which penalises foreign companies that
benefit from investment in property seized by Fidel Castro after the
1959 revolution.
Canada, Mexico and European countries maintain the provisions violate
international trade law and have vowed to retaliate with similar
measures if the legislation is fully implemented.
Santer said he hoped Washington "will be able to improve the
application of this legislation, and show more flexibility."
The United States is hoping to avoid an embarrassing dressing-down by
its G7 partners at the summit, which opens formally Friday morning and
continues until Saturday.
"It is the view of the United States that the Helms-Burton legislation
should not come up in any kind of a major sense at Lyon," State
Department spokesman Glyn Davies said on the eve of the summit.
Santer also spoke out about US sanctions against Iran and Libya. In
particular he said Europe should maintain a "critical dialogue" with
Iran, widely accused of being behind international terrorism.
