South Korean president orders "thorough" probe into Hanbo scandal 
South Korean President Kim Young-Sam on Monday ordered a through
corruption investigation into the controversial failure of the Hanbo
Group.
"The president ordered a through investigation into irregularaties and
corruption over Hanbo," a presidential spokesman said.
The order came amid opposition charges that Kim's close associates or
family were implicated and used their influence to help the troubled
conglomerate obtain massive bank loans despite insufficient collateral.
It was the president's first comment on the snowballing scandal, which
erupted last week when Hanbo Steel and General Construction Co. went
insolvent after failing to honor millions of dollars in promissory
notes.
