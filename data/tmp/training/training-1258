``/`` That/DT 's/VBZ an/DT incredible/JJ rise/NN ,/, ''/'' Wool/NNP International/NNP policy/NN and/CC planning/NN manager/NN Sylvia/NNP Kelly/NNP said/VBD Tuesday/NNP ./.

Kelly/NNP told/VBD AFP/NNP the/DT strong/JJ demand/NN had/VBD been/VBN evident/JJ from/IN March/NNP this/DT year/NN and/CC Chinese/JJ buying/NN had/VBD been/VBN the/DT mainstay/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, continuing/VBG even/RB during/IN recent/JJ price/NN rises/NNS ./.

``/`` That/DT 's/VBZ a/DT bit/RB unusual/JJ because/IN they/PRP tend/VBP to/TO be/VB price/NN sensitive/JJ buyers/NNS but/CC they/PRP have/VBP hung/VBN in/IN there/RB and/CC continued/VBN to/TO buy/VB ,/, ''/'' she/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Another/DT factor/NN is/VBZ the/DT trough/NN of/IN the/DT recession/NN in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC Japan/NNP seems/VBZ to/TO have/VB passed/VBN and/CC there/EX 's/VBZ now/RB increasing/VBG buying/VBG from/IN western/JJ European/JJ countries/NNS ./.

Kelly/NNP said/VBD Germany/NNP and/CC Japan/NNP have/VBP been/VBN slowest/JJS to/TO emerge/VB from/IN recession/NN ,/, but/CC buying/NN had/VBD increased/VBN in/IN France/NNP and/CC Italy/NNP which/WDT had/VBD turned/VBN the/DT corner/NN ./.

A/DT drop/NN in/IN cotton/NN production/NN caused/VBN by/IN a/DT bad/JJ harvest/NN has/VBZ also/RB been/VBN good/JJ for/IN the/DT wool/NN industry/NN ,/, pushing/VBG up/RP cotton/NN prices/NNS and/CC turning/VBG attention/NN to/TO traditional/JJ substitutes/NNS of/IN wool/NN and/CC man-made/JJ fibers/NNS ./.
