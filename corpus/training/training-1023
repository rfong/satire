Neef joins Britain's casualty list 
Melanie Neef joined a mounting casualty list on Wednesday when the 400m
star pulled out of Britain's European Cup team for Madrid.
Neef, winner of the event in Lille last year, has an Achilles problem
and withdrew from two weekend meetings.
After further physiotherapy, the 26-year-old Glasgow runner decided to
restrict herself to a leg of the 4x400m relay.
Donna Fraser or Allison Curbishley will take over from Neef, who does
not want to jeopardise her Olympic prospects.
She joins fellow experienced internationals Mick Hill (javelin), Ann
Griffiths (1500m) and Alison Wyeth (5000m) in withdrawing.
Britain also lost Tony Jarrett from the sprint relay squad and Iwan
Thomas from the 4x400m line-up today.
Jarrett wants to concentrate on his high hurdling for Atlanta. Thomas,
Britain's fastest 400m man this season, has hamstring trouble.
