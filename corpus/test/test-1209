Evening wear is a paradox.
These are the clothes most women wear the least, yet the garments over
which they agonize the most.
Evening wear is often bought in haste, bought on sale or bought with
only one occasion in mind, when in reality, its expense and importance
dictate that it should be given the most thought.
Well, there's still time, sister.
Even though the fall social season is set to swing into action any
moment now, a well-thought-out evening wardrobe remains a possibility.
While it may be too late to purchase a September dress from among the
trunk shows coming to stores in the next few weeks -- some designers
now send their fall trunk shows out as early as April -- much of fall
and winter's evening wear is just now hitting stores.
First, make a list of the big evening events and special occasions in
your life between now and March 1, the approximate date when spring
fashions begin to blossom in the Southwest.
Second, decide which events call for cocktail clothes, which are formal
and which are more casual, when evening pajamas might suffice.
Third, review your closet to see (a) how many of the evening clothes in
your closet can still be worn and (b) whether new accessories,
alterations or additions can update outfits you already own.
Finally, make a list of your must-haves for evening. Do you need a ball
gown? A cocktail dress or suit? Evening pajamas? A dress for a formal
wedding, your retirement party or a cruise?
Educating yourself on current styles before shopping will pay off in
the long run, as you will probably choose clothes on the upswing of
their popularity. Voluminous ball gowns, for example, are on the way
out. Only a few designers had anything suggesting tulle petticoats, and
when Isaac Mizrahi put together a navel-baring, hip-hung mass of plaid
taffeta, it was a ball skirt, not a gown.
Long dresses for fall are skinnier, although not always straight. The
straightest dresses usually have slits, sometimes up to there, and some
of the dresses are not straight at all, although they appear that way
with layers of chiffon that fall straight in repose and drift when the
wearer walks.
What makes these chiffon dresses new? Very often it's the iridescence
of the fabric. And with velvets, they might be crushed velvets this
fall or subtle shading from neck to hem for an ombre effect.
Column dresses that hug the midriff and the waist or fall from tiny
straps, in the case of the slip dress, are also narrow and may be
flared at the hem.
The bias-cut dress, usually of featherweight satin or silk charmeuse,
merely skims the figure. Cutting the pieces on the diagonal causes the
fabric to cup the body in places and ripple naturally in fullish
skirts. Think glamorous movie-star looks from the 1930s and '40s in
dresses that are downright slinky.
The black dress remains most important for fall and winter, and the
choices are many. Interestingly, too, many designers sent out dresses
in very short and very long versions with identical bodices. Note also
that the V-neck dress is coming on strong again, especially at Victor
Alfaro's, where he piles on the Harry Winston diamonds. Simple,
sophisticated dresses can only mean a return to real jewels.
Red is the second-most-important color for evening, followed closely by
white or cream, then the deep tones of brown, royal, purple, teal,
green, rose and all shades of gray.
Ultra-bright colors are indeed around, but mostly for the very young
who prefer neon orange or fuchsia to muted Persian orange and rose red.
So where have all the bugle beads gone?
Actually, beading is still around. There is jet beading on black satin
or lace, metallic embroidery, gold beads, and jewels on Persian and
Moroccan-inspired finery. There is plenty of antique bronze, matte
silver and copper used as accents, even huge stones and crystals used
as trims. But shine this season comes mostly from the fabrics
themselves, rather than the trims.
Golden and silver organzas, gazars and silks, as well as metallic
laces, are everywhere and frequently used against the matte fabric,
black velvet, to accentuate the shine.
Velvet is the fabric of choice for subdued evenings, and it comes in a
wide range of colors from deepest browns and greens to royal purple and
pale chamois. But once again, black velvet teamed with black stretchy,
sheer fabrics is hitting a home run for Carolina Herrera's early
buyers.
Donna Karan, however, designed the most subtle of evening clothes,
mixing soft, pale cashmeres with silks and satins, playing the
sportswear fabric off seductive bias-cut, sarong-draped or flowing
skirts, both long and short.
Textured fabrics are very popular, from wrinkles and crinkles to
puckers, knots, weaves and re-embroidered or all-over-embroidered
patterns with tiny beads. Witness Oscar de la Renta's rich-upon-rich
creations and Rifat Ozbek's fur-trimmed tucked velvets and heavy
satins.
Tuxedo looks and the le smoking of Yves Saint Laurent fame are still
with us, especially since pantsuits are so popular again. The same look
can be achieved, however, by adding a cream silk charmeuse top to a
black wool daytime pantsuit or a stark white, tucked tuxedo shirt with
feminine accessories.
Feather boas, capes and trims return to fashion, recalling '20s and
'30s trends. Once again, the clothes they grace are relatively simple,
soft and feminine and usually solid colors.
The only prints around this year are Persian, Moroccan or African by
inspiration, with the exception of a huge dose of animal prints, both
as faux fur and printed chiffons or silks.
If you are looking to update a black cocktail suit or dress already in
your wardrobe, this is a fine year to add black patterned hosiery and a
pair of high-heeled black sandals.
