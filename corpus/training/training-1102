Indy racer still critical 
US racer Stan Fox remained unconscious and in critical condition here
Thursday while doctors and officials began sorting out various problems
from the Indianapolis 500.
Fox suffered a brain injury in a first-turn crash and remains stable
after a blood clot was removed from his brain. Doctors are treating him
now to prevent swelling that could cause further harm.
Several more days are needed to determine the extent of his brain
damage, said doctors, who praised the helmet and shock absorbing
abilities of race cars with saving Fox's life.
Fox's car flew into pieces after slamming into the outer wall of the
speedway and being struck by the car of rival Eddie Cheever.
Canada's Jacques Villeneuve won the 500-mile (800km) event after
countryman Scott Goodyear improperly passed the pace car. Drivers were
critical of pace car driver Don Bailey, but race sanctioning body
president Dick King backed his man Thursday.
"He did nothing wrong," King said. "Drivers are just going to have to
slow down. That's all there is to it. The controversy was all created
by the participants, not the officials."
