Afghan Taliban militia capture key towns north of Kabul: report 
The Taliban militia Thursday captured a key northern town and entered
Gulbahar at the mouth of the Panjsher Valley, stronghold of the ousted
Afghan government's defence minister Ahmed Shaha Masood, an Afghan
information service said.
The religious militia seized Jabul Siraj town, 77 kilomters (48 miles)
north of the Afghan capital after heavy fighting which claimed
casualties on both sides, Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) said.
The Agency said the Gulbahar district at the foothills of Masood's
traditional bastion Panjsher Valley some 90 kilomters (50 miles)
northeast of Kabul also fell to the Taliban.
No independent confirmation was immediately available.
The Pakistan-based private news agency gave no details beyond saying
that at least 11 ex-government soldiers were killed and 80 captured by
the Taliban.
The AIP without naming its source said the Taliban lost six men.
