Five die in blast at illegal fireworks factory 
An explosion at an illegal fireworks factory in central China has
killed at least five people and caused the collapse of several
surrounding buildings, state media said Monday.
The explosion occurred early Saturday morning in the basement of a home
in Wen county, in the central province of Henan, the China News Service
said.
Police were investigating the cause of the blast, it said.
The explosion turned the home in Guangzhuang village into rubble and
caused the collapse of five surrounding homes. The entire area was
littered with paper used to wrap firecrackers, the report said.
China is the world's biggest producer of fireworks, with people in
rural China often illegally producing them in their homes under unsafe
conditions.
Figures for those killed annually in firework production accidents are
not released, but are thought to be high.
A year ago, at least 42 children were killed in an explosion at a
village school in south China's Jiangxi province which had forced
students to make firecrackers.
