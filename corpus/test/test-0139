India appoints new mediators to resolve Kashmir hostage crisis by Surinder Oberoi 
Indian authorities appointed fresh mediators late Friday in a bid to
resume snapped contact with the Moslem rebel abductors holding four
Western tourists for nearly three months in Kashmir.
An official spokesman, meanwhile, expressed cautious optimism that
contact with the Al-Faran rebel group would be resumed over the
weekend, adding that intermediaries had said the hostages were "safe."
He gave no details about the new mediators.
The official Crisis Management Group, led by retired lieutenant general
D.D. Saklani -- an adviser to the Kashmir governor, held an emergency
meeting in this state summer capital to review the situation, officials
said.
Diplomats from Britain, the United States and Germany were also present
at the meeting which discussed the breaking of links with Al-Faran.
There has been no contact for more than 10 days.
"This is for the first time in the nearly three-month-old crisis that
the militants could not be contacted," spokesman Kulbhushan Jindiyal
said. "However, the situation is not alarming.
"They are safe in the custody of the militants who are holding them,"
he said and hoped the crisis would end peacefully.
Al-Faran militants seized Britons Paul Wells, 23, and Keith Mangan, 33,
German Dirk Hasert, 26 and American Donald Hutchings, 42, between July
4 and 8 in the Kashmir hill district of Pahalgam.
A fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans-Christian Ostro, 27, was beheaded by
the abductors in the first week of August.
Kashmir officials had been in touch with Al-Faran over the radio. The
hostages are believed to be safe but sick after being marched at
gunpoint from one mountain hideout to another across the Kashmir
Valley, dodging thousands of Indian troops.
Indian officials believe Al-Faran is linked to the Harkat-ul-Ansar
militant outfit, comprising mainly Afghan guerrillas. The Harkat
kidnapped two British trekkers in Kashmir last year but released them
unharmed after 17 days.
More than 12,000 people have died in Kashmir since 1989 when Moslem
separatists stepped up a drive against Indian rule. India accuses
Pakistan of fomenting militancy in the state but Islamabad denies the
charge.
