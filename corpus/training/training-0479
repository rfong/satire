In Paris, trading was suspended after workers protesting the partial
privatization of the state-owned car manufacturer Renault stormed into
the exchange.
French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery has announced that around 30
percent part of Renault's capital would be sold before the end of the
year to private investors while the state would retain a majority stake
in the company which for decades has set the pace in French labour
relations.
Prior to the invasion, Groupe Andre had risen 6.5 percent, while
Eurafrance and Damart were both up 3.5 percent, DMC had lifted 2.8
percent, Pechiney CIP was up 2.3 percent while Schneider was up 2.4
percent and Suez was up two percent.
Bouygues dropped 3.2 percent while Roussel-Uclaf and Fives Lille were
down two percent.
