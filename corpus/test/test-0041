Prisoners With Release Papers Stage Riot Calling To Be Let Out 
About 50 Dominican prisoners ordered released by the courts but still
behind bars rioted Thursday, burning mattresses and clothes in a call
to be let out.
``We want justice, we want liberty,'' shouted the inmates at the La
Victoria prison 14 kilometers (9 miles) north of the capital city.
The eight-hour uprising was quelled only after police sprayed some
20,000 gallons of water into the cells and the country's Human Rights
Commission president, Virgilio Almanzar, asked the inmates to stop.
No injuries were reported.
Santo Domingo prosecutor Alexis Joaquin Castillo was scheduled to meet
with the inmates Friday to evaluate their legal status.
An estimated 130 of La Victoria's 4,000 prisoners were declared
innocent or ordered released by the courts, including this country's
supreme court, months ago but remain in jail. Some were jailed only on
the orders of police, without charges against them.
Human rights groups and the inmates' families have demanded the release
of the prisoners, known locally as ``the disrespected.''
President Joaquin Balaguer has said the prisoners should remain behind
bars, arguing that the decisions to release them were tainted by
corruption. He created a committee to review the cases.
The committee, headed by Attorney General Efrain Reyes Duluc,
recommended in June that 30 of the prisoners be freed. But they remain
jailed.
Balaguer in August pardoned Jose Guillermo Chiari, a Panamanian pilot
who was serving a five-year sentence on a conviction of trafficking 163
kilograms (359 pounds) of cocaine. His appeal was scheduled to go to
court here Friday.
