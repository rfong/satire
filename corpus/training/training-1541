Turkish parliament gives nod to pro-democracy constitution 
The Turkish parliament has approved measures democratising the
country's constitution, turning the page on the basic law inherited
from the last military regime, the Anatolia agency said Sunday.
The new constitution, adopted with 360 deputies in favour and 32
against, provides for extending trades union rights, notably in the
civil service, and lowering the voting age from 21 years to 18.
The total package voted into law early Sunday involved a total 23 (eds:
correct) amendments.
Constitutional reform was one of several conditions set by the European
Parliament for ratification of a customs union agreement between Turkey
and the European Union is approved.
Other conditions include greater freedom of expression in Turkey and
the freeing of jailed Kurish-origin legislators. The European
Parliament is due to look at the customs agreement later this year.
Under the reforms, university lecturers and students will be able to
join political parties, and deputies will be free to change parties
once they are elected. The number of deputies in parliament was
increased from 450 to 550.
The Turkish constitution was passed by an overwhelming majority during
a referendum in 1982 during the 1980-83 period of military rule.
Introductory passages praising the putsch of 1980 will be deleted.
Seven articles in the reform package were rejected during parliamentary
debates. Centre-right deputies rejected an amendment granting public
sector employees the right to strike. But public sector unions will
have the right to draw up collective labour agreements.
The reforms should take effect in the coming days, after being
gazetted.
