India's main centrist party, the Janata Dal, has found a novel way of
promoting their candidates for the upcoming general election, The Asian Age
reported Thursday. It has "rigorously trained" nearly 100 parrots to squawk
"Vote for Janata Dal." The birds will be released in batches over the next
day or two in Patna, the capital of Bihar, where they will canvass for
votes among passers-by.  India will have elections to parliament in
April-May. ---- CAPE TOWN - Actor Omar Sharif's Worldwide Games (OSWG) has
applied for a licence to open a 300 million rand (73.3 million dollar)
casino, hotel and leisure complex in Cape Town, a spokesman for the company
said Wednesday. OSWG hopes that the complex, at the foot of the landmark
Table Mountain and adjacent to the poor townships of Mitchells Plain and
Khayelitsha, will bring economic benefits to the area's black and coloured
(mixed race) residents. Sharif's company believes that casinos should "not
only benefit the shareholders, but must also help the communities in
upliftment programmes," spokeswoman Sarah Martin said in a
statement. bur/msa
