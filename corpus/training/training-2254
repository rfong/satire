Dollar narrowly lower against yen in afternoon Tokyo trading 
The dollar was lower against the yen in a narrow range of trading here
Tuesday, due to lack of incentives amid the summer holiday season,
dealers said.
"Like yesterday, trading was in a narrow range," said Hirokazu Note,
chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank Ltd, adding that "the dollar's top is
still heavy."
The dollar was quoted at 107.61-63 yen in afternoon trading, down from
107.68 yen in New York late Monday and 107.96-98 yen here Monday
afternoon.
Against the mark, the US unit was trading at 1.4770-4772, compared with
1.4780 in New York late Monday and 1.4741-4743 here Monday afternoon.
Trading this week is likely to be thin in Tokyo due to the summer
holidays, dealers said.
Market players are also taking to the sidelines because "main events
such as the Federal Reserves policy meeting and Bundesbank council
meeting will take place next week," Note said.
Japanese exporters are seen placing selling orders at the 108- and
109-yen level while institutional investors are waiting to buy at
around 107.20 yen, he added.
