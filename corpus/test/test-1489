Quick expulsion of Harry Wu from China could clear major obstacle
A quick expulsion from China of jailed Chinese-American human rights
activist Harry Wu, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison Thursday,
could remove a major obstacle to improved US-Chinese ties.
China announced early Thursday through its official Xinhua news agency
that Wu, 58, had been convicted of spying by a court in the central
city of Wuhan and sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment.
Xinhua also said he would be expelled from the country, but it was not
immediately clear whether he would have to serve all or part of his
sentence.
The State Department gave a terse response late Wednesday to the
sentencing and reiterated its position that he should be immediately
released.
"Chinese law gives the right to appeal verdict and sentence. We
continue to believe that Mr. Wu should be allowed to leave China
immediately," a spokeswoman said.
In Wyoming, where President Bill Clinton is vacationing, White House
spokeswoman Ginny Terzano said the United States is seeking further
clarification of the expulsion order's significance.
She said the United States hoped the expulsion would be immediate.
Terzano declined to answer questions on how the announcement would
affect a pending decision on whether First Lady Hillary Clinton would
travel to Beijing to attend the UN conference on women.
"We continue to believe that it would be in the best interests of
China, the United States, and Harry that he be expelled immediately and
return home," Wu's wife, Ching Lee Wu said in a statement.
"I remain hopeful that the Chinese government will expel Harry in the
near future," she added.
Wu was unable to walk unassisted during his trial due to back problems,
his wife reported. She urged Beijing to release him so could obtain
medical treatment in the United States.
The State Department spokeswoman, who refused to answer questions or to
elaborate, said it was unlikely that the sentence would have changed
the travel plans of US Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff, expected
in China on Thursday.
Beijing's announcement came on the same day that Tarnoff was to arrive
in China on an official visit during which he was scheduled to meet
with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing.
Tarnoff was to be the highest-ranking US official to visit China since
bilateral ties took a sharp turn for the worse after Taiwan's president
paid a private visit here in June over Beijing's strenuous objections.
Chinese authorities detained Wu on June 19 as he tried to cross into
China from Kazakhstan and charged him July 8 with spying during
previous undercover trips to expose alleged human rights abuses in
China.
Wu served 19 years in Chinese prisons before immigrating to the United
States in 1985. He has testified often before the US Congress and
international panels on human rights abuses in China.
He returned on several occasions to China posing as a businessman or
police officer to document forced prison labor and the sale of organs
for transplant from executed prisoners to cash-paying foreigners or
Chinese with political connections.
Wu's high visibility and political connections brought intense pressure
to bear on the Clinton administration to take a tough line with China
pending his release.
Republican legislators, Wu's wife, human rights groups, and some White
House aides have urged Hillary Clinton to stay away from the UN
conference on women, from September 4-15 in Beijing, if Wu remains in
detention.
"One could have written this scenario before it happened," said Orville
Schell, a close friend of Wu's and a respected China analyst.
Speaking by phone from his home in California, Schell cited "enormous
pressure to get him out of China before the UN conference."
