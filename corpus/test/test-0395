Conner claims first semi-final win 
Dennis Conner and his Stars and Stripes crew twice came from behind
Friday to defeat America3's almost all-woman Mighty Mary crew for their
first victory of the America's Cup defender semifinals.
Unofficially, the margin was eight seconds -- little more than a boat
length.
But Mighty Mary was scored as did-not-finish because, being behind at
the end, it disdained doing a penalty turn.
The on-water umpires had flagged Mighty Mary for sailing below a proper
course in trying to hold off Stars and Stripes in the last downwind
mile of the race.
The challengers' semi-final races started later because of a
combination of low tide and heavy surf in the Mission Bay entrance
channel.
Stars and Stripes and America3 are based in San Diego Bay, along with
Team New Zealand and Nippon Challenge, while TAG Heuer and oneAustralia
are in Mission Bay.
Team New Zealand was leading oneAustralia by 56 seconds at the first
mark, while Chris Dickson's TAG Heuer came from six seconds behind
Nippon at the first mark to lead by 22 seconds at the second mark.
Stars and Stripes' win was its first in the semi-finals and, combined
with its bonus win, lifted it into second place with a 2-2 record
behind Young America (4-0) and ahead of Mighty Mary (1-2), which
replaced tactician Jennifer Ann (J.J.) Isler with Dave Dellenbaugh a
week ago.
Never more than 35 seconds behind, Stars and Stripes made its best
gains downwind, including near the finish when it caught up, gybed on
Mighty Mary's wind and rolled past to the victory.
