Palestinians protest Jewish settlements 
About 500 Palestinians protested Monday in the Dheisheh refugee camp
near Bethlehem against Israeli plans to expand Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, sources said.
The protesters, who burned an Israeli flag and waved the Iraqi and
Lebanese flags, also demonstrated against attempts by Jewish settlers
to destroy a monument commemorating Palestinians from Dheisheh killed
by Israeli soldiers, the Palestinian sources added.
No incidents were reported with Palestinian police or the Israeli
soldiers stationed outside the refugee camp.
The Israeli military approved on Thursday the construction of 2,000
more homes for Jewish settlers on the West Bank.
The new right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu decided in July to lift the freeze on expanding settlements.
