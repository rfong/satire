Bildt sees Karadzic withdrawal from "public life" 
Top civilian official Carl Bildt said Sunday that Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic appeared to be withdrawing from "public life" in the Serb
Republic.
"The situation is not yet entirely clarified, but the gist of it is
that I don't expect we'll see very much of him in public life," Bildt
told reporters here.
Karadzic told the official Serb news agency SRNA, in a communique
overnight, that he was handing over powers for dealings with the
international community to Biljana Plavsic, a noted hardliner.
The Tanjug news agency, citing the communique, said Karadzic was
stepping down entirely from the Serb presidency.
Asked by reporters when and how far Karadzic would go in leaving power,
Bildt said the "exact modalities of that still have to be worked out."
But he said that if the sidelining of Karadzic did become effective it
would be "one step towards" an appearance before the UN war crimes
court in The Hague to face indictments for war crimes.
"We will see, as things happen and don't happen in the next few weeks,"
he continued, adding that he expected "some formalities" to occur
concerning the sidelining of Karadzic.
Asked if he might make a trip to Pale Sunday, after returning to
Sarajevo from there at 5:30 a.m. (0330 GMT), he said it was possible.
Bildt was expected in the Greek capital Athens Sunday evening.
