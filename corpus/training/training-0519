Shanghai Enterprises Donates 1.6 Million Yuan to Project Hope 
Some 10,000 Shanghai enterprises have donated over 1.58 million yuan to
Project Hope, a nongovernmental program which supports school children
from poverty-stricken families.
The Shanghai branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),
which acts as the agent for over 10,000 corporate donors, has
transferred the donation to the China Youth Development Foundation, the
project organizer.
The donations came from medium- to large-sized state-owned enterprises,
private plants and individuals, as well as 587 affiliate savings banks
of the ICBC Shanghai branch.
Corporations in the city have been encouraged to donate at least 100
yuan each to the project in order to facilitate the development of
education in poverty-stricken regions.
