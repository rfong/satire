Up to 4,000 dead as malaria epidemic flares 
More than 78,000 people have contracted malaria and hundreds or
thousands died of the disease in an epidemic that has flared in the
northern Indian state of Rajasthan, officials and news reports said
Saturday.
"A total of 78,087 people have contracted the disease since January 1
and 232 have died according to our records," said R.K. Singh, a
spokesman of the state health department in Rajasthan capital of
Jaipur.
But regional newspapers on Saturday estimated that up to 4,000 people
may have died in four districts of Rajasthan.
Singh, an epidemiologist, asserted that the higher figures contained in
news reports were based on private estimates and said the state
government was conducting a census in the malaria-infected zones of
Rajasthan.
The Indian Express reported more than 4,000 deaths resulting from the
epidemic since July. The Pioneer daily said the disease has left some
2,000 people dead in the four desert districts.
India's National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP) officials
confirmed the malaria outbreak in Rajasthan, and said thousands have
contracted the disease in Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Pohkran and Barmer.
NMEP epidemiologist B.S. Rao said 63 percent of people examined
randomly in the four impoverished districts had tested
malaria-positive.
The privately-run Voluntary Health Association of India has placed the
fatality toll from the epidemic at 2,000, and stated that 67,950 people
contracted the disease between July and October, The Pioneer said.
The association blamed the outbreak on unsanitary conditions at a
state-built irrigation canal coursing through the affected zone, The
Pioneer said. The epidemic flared in July, experts said.
"The figures given out by government officials do not come anywhere
near the actual position," the Indian Express said. That newspaper said
private medical groups have confirmed 11,000 positive cases out of
173,000 people tested for celebral malaria in Barmer alone.
"Though the outbreak began in mid-August, it was as late as October 1
that the state government took note of the situation and launched an
action plan," the Express added.
