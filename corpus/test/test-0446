IMF Says Italy Will Have Trouble Reaching Deficit-GDP Goal 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Wednesday lowered its GDP
forecasts for Italy and the euro zone by predicting that Italy would
have "difficulty" reaching the deficit-GDP ratio goal in its 2001
Economic Stability Plan.
In its World Economic Outlook survey, the IMF said Italy's GDP was
expected to grow by 1.8 percent or 0.2 points less than forecast last
May, while 2002 growth was expected to be 2 percent, or 0.5 points
lower.
The survey showed GDP in the 12-nation euro zone was expected to grow
by 1.8 percent, 0.6 points lower than the May forecast.
"Some countries, such as France, Germany and Italy will have difficulty
reaching the objectives for 2001 set in their respective national
stability programs," said the IMF statement.
It added that it was essential to maintain the credibility of the
overall Stability and Growth Pact, especially in light of the
"challenges" that will come from the aging of the population in coming
years.
The IMF also said that it lowered its outlook for the world's economic
growth to 2.6 percent for 2001, or 0.6 points below earlier estimates,
and 3.5 percent for 2002, down 0.4 points.
However, it stressed that this estimate was made before taking into
account the economic global effects of the September 11 terrorist
attacks in the United States, so it was "too early to make a
comprehensive assessment of the risks" brought on by those events.
The estimate for growth of the U.S.' GDP was lowered to 1.3 percent for
2001 and 2.2 percent for 2002.
