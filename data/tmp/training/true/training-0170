Buck/NNP Showalter/NNP sounded/VBD confused/JJ and/CC helpless/JJ as/IN he/PRP talked/VBD about/IN the/DT status/NN of/IN his/PRP$ striking/JJ players/NNS ,/, two/CD emotions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP rarely/RB associated/VBN with/IN the/DT control-crazed/JJ ,/, detail-oriented/JJ Yankee/NNP manager/NN ./.

Whether/IN he/PRP is/VBZ watching/VBG another/DT minor/JJ league/NN game/NN or/CC scampering/VBG through/IN another/DT airport/NN ,/, Showalter/NNP 's/POS thoughts/NNS for/IN almost/RB two/CD weeks/NNS now/RB have/VBP frequently/RB drifted/VBD to/TO what/WP his/PRP$ players/NNS are/VBP doing/VBG ./.

He/PRP wishes/VBZ he/PRP knew/VBD ./.

Showalter/NNP claimed/VBD that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ not/RB spoken/VBN to/TO any/DT players/NNS since/IN the/DT strike/NN began/VBD on/RP Aug./NNP 12/CD because/IN he/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN inundated/VBN with/IN scouting/VBG trips/NNS ./.

After/IN spending/VBG a/DT few/JJ days/NNS at/IN home/NN in/IN Pace/NNP ,/, Fla./NNP ,/, he/PRP went/VBD to/TO Fort/NNP Mill/NNP ,/, S.C./NNP ,/, and/CC then/RB to/TO Columbus/NNP ,/, Ohio/NNP ,/, to/TO scout/VB the/DT Yankees/NNPS '/POS Class/NNP AAA/NNP Clippers/NNP ./.

He/PRP is/VBZ now/RB in/IN Albany/NNP ,/, with/IN the/DT Class/NNP AA/NNP club/NN ./.

What/WP about/IN the/DT major/JJ league/NN Yankees/VBZ ?/.

They/PRP might/MD as/RB well/RB have/VB been/VBN hiding/VBG on/IN one/CD of/IN his/PRP$ flights/NNS ./.

``/`` You/PRP try/VBP to/TO stay/VB in/IN touch/NN with/IN them/PRP ,/, but/CC you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP to/TO do/VB ,/, ''/'' Showalter/NNP conceded/VBD Wednesday/NNP ,/, in/IN a/DT telephone/NN interview/NN from/IN his/PRP$ Albany/NNP hotel/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT strange/JJ situation/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ weird/JJ ./.

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP to/TO do/VB ./. ''/''

It/PRP is/VBZ permissible/JJ for/IN Showalter/NNP to/TO speak/VB with/IN his/PRP$ players/NNS during/IN the/DT strike/NN ,/, so/IN he/PRP could/MD potentially/RB retrieve/VB answers/NNS about/IN Mike/NNP Stanley/NNP 's/POS bruised/JJ right/NN hand/NN ,/, Don/NNP Mattingly/NNP 's/POS chronic/JJ right/JJ wrist/NN injury/NN or/CC whether/IN Jimmy/NNP Key/NNP and/CC Melido/NNP Perez/NNP are/VBP throwing/VBG consistently/RB ./.

But/CC he/PRP admitted/VBD that/IN telephoning/VBG them/PRP would/MD be/VB an/DT unusual/JJ and/CC delicate/JJ matter/NN that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ so/RB far/RB avoided/VBN ./.

Even/RB though/IN Showalter/NNP has/VBZ conversed/VBN with/IN trainer/NN Gene/NNP Monahan/NNP to/TO get/VB updates/NNS on/IN those/DT who/WP have/VBP injuries/NNS ,/, a/DT club/NN spokesman/NN said/VBD that/IN no/DT Yankees/NNPS have/VBP been/VBN sighted/VBN in/IN the/DT Bronx/NNP since/IN the/DT strike/NN began/VBD ./.

Paul/NNP Gibson/NNP is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ Yankee/NN who/WP lives/VBZ in/IN the/DT metropolitan/JJ area/NN year-round/NN and/CC he/PRP was/VBD at/IN the/DT strike/NN negotiations/NNS Wednesday/NNP ./.

Still/RB ,/, Monahan/NNP has/VBZ surely/RB spoken/VBN to/TO various/JJ players/NNS and/CC has/VBZ surely/RB reiterated/VBN the/DT team/NN 's/POS advice/NN to/TO remain/VB in/IN shape/NN ,/, similar/JJ to/TO what/WP he/PRP does/VBZ in/IN the/DT off/JJ season/NN ./.

When/WRB Showalter/NNP was/VBD told/VBN by/IN a/DT reporter/NN that/IN a/DT dozen/NN calls/NNS to/TO players/NNS on/IN Tuesday/NNP afternoon/NN did/VBD not/RB find/VB any/DT of/IN them/PRP home/RB ,/, the/DT manager/NN quickly/RB asked/VBD ,/, ``/`` Were/VBD they/PRP working/NN out/RB ?/. ''/''

Showalter/NNP was/VBD told/VBN that/IN only/RB Mike/NNP Gallego/NNP was/VBD discovered/VBN to/TO definitely/RB be/VB working/VBG out/RP because/IN the/DT majority/NN of/IN calls/NNS drew/VBD responses/NNS from/IN answering/NN machines/NNS or/CC simply/RB were/VBD not/RB answered/VBN at/IN all/DT ./.

Once/RB so/RB optimistic/JJ about/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN a/DT quick/JJ strike/NN settlement/NN ,/, Showalter/NNP sounded/VBD pessimistic/JJ Wednesday/NNP ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP the/DT next/JJ two/CD or/CC three/CD days/NNS are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB big/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, wondering/VBG whether/IN a/DT terminated/VBN season/NN would/MD render/VB New/NNP York/NNP 's/POS 70-43/JJ record/NN meaningless/JJ ./.

``/`` You/PRP have/VBP to/TO have/VB faith/NN in/IN your/PRP$ people/NNS that/IN they/PRP 'll/MD be/VB ready/JJ to/TO play/VB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Showalter/NNP ./.
