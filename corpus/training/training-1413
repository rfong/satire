Thai Stock Exchange Gains 52 Points 
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (set) Index Monday showed the biggest
gain in one day since January 11 last year, and the turnover value,
surpassing 10 billion baht (400 million US dollars), was at its best
since January 13 this year.
The thai share market monday surged with other exchanges in Asia,
jumping 52.35 points (4.1 percent), to end the day at 1,330.42 points.
In the heaviest trading in months, 176.17 million shares worth 14.4
billion baht (576 million US dollars) changed hands. Gains overwhelmed
losses 291-67, with 58 issues closing unchanged.
The SET seemed inspired by Wall Street which gained 57 points in its
last trading session.
The SET Index opened by rising sharply, gaining 22 points in the first
25 minutes of trading and doubling that gain in the next hour, brokers
said.
A securities expert said foreign institutional investors have returned
to the market and the big gains in blue-chips caught local investors
off guard.
Foreign investors Monday bought 35.84 percent of total trading
turnover, while their sales amounted to a mere 18.79 percent of the
total.
Analysts forecast a further surge in the SET Index. But profit- taking
is possible.
