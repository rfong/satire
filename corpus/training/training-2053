Cyprus Protests Against Turkish Violations of Air 
Cyprus has formally lodged a protest to the United Nations against new
Turkish violations of its air space and Nicosia's flight information
region (FIR) last week.
According to Cyprus News Agency today, the protest letter, which the
U.N. circulated as an official document, said "such actions increase
tension on the island as U.N. Security Council resolution 1062
testifies."
The resolution expresses "serious concern about recent military
exercises in the region, including overflights in the airspace of
Cyprus by military fixed wing aircraft, which have increased tension."
Last Friday, five Turkish jets flew over Cyprus eastern tip, the
Karpass Peninsula, and the eastern coastal town of Famagusta. Both
areas have been under Turkish control since the Turkish invasion of
Cyprus in 1974.
The letter notes that the violations are "an additional indication of
Turkish provocative behavior in that they took place on the eve of the
22nd anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus".
In a separate move, the Cyprus' permanent mission to the U.N. lodged a
strong protest over last week's visit by Turkey's Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan to the Turkish-controlled northern part of the
island.
The Turkish prime minister paid a one-day visit last Saturday to attend
so-called celebrations in the northern part of Cyprus marking the 22nd
anniversary of the Turkish invasion.
Cyprus has also made representations in writing to U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali about the visit.
This Eastern Mediterranean island has been divided into the
Turkish-Cyprus community in the north and the Greek-Cyprus community in
the south since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and seized the
northern third of the island following a short-lived coup by some Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
