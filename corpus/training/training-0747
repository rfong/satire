Traffic Controllers Continue Strikes; Delays, Some Cancellations 
Air traffic controllers continued intermittent strike actions Tuesday,
causing long delays and some cancellations of flights at Zaventem
international airport, officials said.
Despite the threat of legal action, the controllers started their
two-hour work stoppage at 11 a.m. (0900GMT), affecting many of the
transatlantic flights leaving for the United States.
A new two-hour strike was announced for 6 p.m. (1600GMT).
Belgium's national carrier Sabena said the labor actions had already
cost the company 130 million francs (dlrs 4.3 million) since the
strikes resumed last Friday.
The 350 air traffic controllers are on strike for better working
conditions.
The federation of airline companies flying on Belgium has threatened to
take the traffic controllers to court if they continue their actions.
