International experts say it will take two decades and at least five
billion dollars to clean up the heavily polluted coast of Primorsky
region in the Russian Far East, ITAR-TASS news agency reported
Wednesday.
Experts from Russia, the United States and Norway said that the
clean-up of refuse, sunken ships and other pollutants along the coast
could be conducted by Russian firms working in cooperation with
American and Norweigan ones.
In addition to the benefit of a better ecology, officials in the region
say that much of the pollutants could be recycled and provide
significant financial resources.
