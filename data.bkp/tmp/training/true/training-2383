The/DT defense/NN in/IN such/JJ cases/NNS would/MD typically/RB want/VB jurors/NNS who/WP are/VBP not/RB experts/NNS at/IN science/NN and/CC math/NN ,/, Troutwine/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` In/IN general/NN ,/, when/WRB you/PRP have/VBP a/DT jury/NN that/WDT does/VBZ n't/RB understand/VB evidence/NN ,/, they/PRP tend/VBP to/TO throw/VB that/DT evidence/NN out/RP ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Often/RB juries/NNS will/MD side/VB with/IN the/DT expert/NN who/WP states/VBZ his/PRP$ case/NN the/DT most/JJS clearly/RB ./. ''/''

But/CC Brown/NNP said/VBD the/DT defense/NN might/MD want/VB smarter/JJ jurors/NNS if/IN their/PRP$ DNA/NN expert/NN is/VBZ on/IN strong/JJ ground/NN ./.

Brown/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB use/VB consultants/NNS ,/, but/CC he/PRP said/VBD he/PRP led/VBD in/IN designing/VBG the/DT questionnaire/NN that/IN he/PRP and/CC McCaskill/NNP used/VBD this/DT summer/NN to/TO select/VB the/DT jury/NN for/IN Denver/NNP Blackwell/NNP ./.

McCaskill/NNP won/VBD a/DT first-degree/JJ murder/NN verdict/NN ,/, but/CC Brown/NNP forced/VBD a/DT plea/NN deal/NN in/IN which/WDT Blackwell/NNP escaped/VBD the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ./.

As/IN for/IN the/DT Rush/NNP Limbaugh/NNP supporters/NNS on/IN that/DT jury/NN ,/, Brown/NNP said/VBD :/: ``/`` I/PRP 'd/MD rather/RB know/VB they/PRP 're/VBP there/RB than/IN get/VB blindsided/JJ ./.

But/CC no/DT matter/NN how/WRB much/JJ you/PRP learn/VBP about/IN jury/NN candidates/NNS ,/, Brown/NNP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` sometimes/RB you/PRP have/VBP to/TO go/VB with/IN a/DT gut/NN feeling/NN ./. ''/''

Patrick/NNP W./NNP Peters/NNP put/VBD six/CD persons/NNS on/IN death/NN row/NN before/IN he/PRP quit/VBD last/JJ year/NN as/IN an/DT assistant/JJ Jackson/NNP County/NNP prosecutor/NN --/: and/CC he/PRP never/RB used/VBD a/DT consultant/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP 'd/MD rather/RB look/VB somebody/NN in/IN the/DT face/NN and/CC ask/VB him/PRP a/DT question/NN than/IN have/VB reams/NNS of/IN demographic/JJ data/NNS ,/, ''/'' Peters/NNP said/VBD ./.

He/PRP joked/VBD with/IN potential/JJ jurors/NNS during/IN voir/FW dire/FW ,/, and/CC he/PRP preached/VBD the/DT importance/NN of/IN jury/NN selection/NN like/IN a/DT minister/NN selling/VBG the/DT Bible/NNP ./.

Peters/NNP wanted/VBD to/TO establish/VB intimacy/NN and/CC trust/NN with/IN each/DT juror/NN ./.

Those/DT feelings/NNS should/MD last/VB through/IN trial/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, and/CC peak/NN in/IN closing/NN statements/NNS ./.

Peters/NNP did/VBD n't/RB ignore/VB the/DT so-called/JJ old/JJ truisms/NNS --/: older/JJR juries/NNS are/VBP better/JJR ,/, college-educated/JJ juries/NNS are/VBP more/RBR liberal/JJ and/CC rural/JJ juries/NNS are/VBP more/RBR conservative/JJ ./.

But/CC he/PRP did/VBD n't/RB cling/VB to/TO them/PRP ./.

``/`` Take/VB a/DT 55-year-old/JJ steelworker/NN ,/, a/DT war/NN veteran/NN who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT victim/NN of/IN burglaries/NNS --/: if/IN I/PRP get/VBP the/DT feeling/NN he/PRP likes/VBZ the/DT defendant/NN ,/, demographics/NNS be/VB damned/VBN --/: he/PRP 's/VBZ gone/VBN ./. ''/''

The/DT prosecutor/NN also/RB should/MD use/VB his/PRP$ voir/JJ dire/JJ questions/NNS to/TO plant/VB his/PRP$ game/NN plan/NN in/IN jurors/NNS '/POS minds/NNS ,/, Peters/NNP said/VBD ./.

He/PRP would/MD hint/VB at/IN that/DT plan/NN or/CC theme/NN throughout/IN trial/NN and/CC slam-dunk/VB it/PRP home/RB in/IN closing/VBG statements/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT Simpson/NNP case/NN ,/, for/IN instance/NN ,/, Peters/NNP said/VBD prosecutors/NNS should/MD work/VB on/IN the/DT concept/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT perfect/JJ case/NN ./.

He/PRP said/VBD that/IN 's/VBZ because/IN the/DT defense/NN ``/`` will/MD be/VB holding/VBG up/RP the/DT standard/NN of/IN perfection/NN ./. ''/''

``/`` When/WRB you/PRP voir/VBZ dire/JJ a/DT jury/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ electricity/NN ,/, a/DT contact/NN with/IN people/NNS ./. ''/''

Many/JJ lawyers/NNS and/CC consultants/NNS try/VBP to/TO make/VB trials/NNS too/RB technical/JJ ,/, Beaird/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` A/DT trial/NN is/VBZ no/RB more/RBR complicated/JJ than/IN selling/VBG a/DT pair/NN of/IN shoes/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` You/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN your/PRP$ version/NN of/IN events/NNS ,/, and/CC what/WP you/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG is/VBZ selling/VBG that/DT ,/, ''/'' Beaird/NNP said/VBD ./.

A/DT decade/NN ago/RB ,/, Beaird/NNP said/VBD ,/, area/NN prosecutors/NNS --/: although/IN none/NN would/MD admit/VB it/PRP --/: routinely/RB struck/VBD black/JJ people/NNS off/IN juries/NNS ./.

``/`` They/PRP 'd/MD strike/VB all/PDT the/DT blacks/NNS and/CC leave/VB on/IN five/CD white/JJ guys/NNS in/IN Harley-Davidson/NNP T-shirts/NNS ,/, guys/NNS who/WP would/MD sympathize/VB with/IN me/PRP ./. ''/''

Even/RB with/IN minorities/NNS on/IN Simpson/NNP 's/POS jury/NN ,/, lawyers/NNS question/VBP whether/IN it/PRP can/MD consist/VB of/IN the/DT ideal/JJ ``/`` fair/JJ cross-section/NN ./. ''/''

Beaird/NNP and/CC Troutwine/NNP agree/VBP that/IN the/DT long/JJ Simpson/NNP trial/NN --/: expected/VBN to/TO last/JJ months/NNS --/: could/MD distort/VB the/DT jury/NN pool/NN ./.
