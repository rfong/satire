N. Irish Formula Offers Early Government: Report 
A coalition government will be formed in Northern Ireland in two weeks
if parties accept a peace formula on offer at mediation talks,
Ireland's national broadcasting network RTE reported Sunday.
Quoting "authoritative unionist sources," it said the powerful
pro-British Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) would be able to suspend the
government if Irish Republican Army guerrillas did not start disarming
by the end of December.
"RTE news has learned from authoritative unionist sources that the new
Northern Ireland Executive is to be formed in the next two weeks
provided the deal receives the endorsement of all the pro-agreement
parties," the network reported.
Analysts say Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who supports the
peace pact, may gamble his political future by calling a meeting of the
party's 850-member policy-making council on November 27 in a bid to get
backing for the new formula.
U.S. mediator George Mitchell adjourned the talks last Friday amid
confusion and Sinn Fein claims that the unionists had rejected the
proposal.
Unionists refuse to share power with Sinn Fein unless the IRA starts to
hand in arms -- a stance which they term "no guns, no government."
A senior IRA figure would be appointed to liaise with the province's
"decommissioning commission" which is headed by former Canadian General
John de Chastelain, who would then "be able to report that the process
of decommissioning had started," it said.
The deal would also allow for the creation of new all-Ireland political
institutions, something which was mapped out in the 1998 Good Friday
accord, to proceed without delay, RTE added.
