Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum Opens in Mexico
The third annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific parliamentary forum opened
in the Mexican seaside resort of Acapulco today.
Attending the two-day meeting are delegates from countries in the
region, including Mexico, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Thailand and
the United States, the six member countries of the forum's executive
committee.
During the meeting the delegates will discuss political, social and
cultural issues arising from economic growth and integration, and the
promotion of relations among the national parliaments in the region.
Organizational matters relating to the forum and cooperation between
the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions will also be discussed.
A Chinese parliamentary delegation, headed by Zhu Liang, chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese People's National
Congress, is attending the meeting.
The Asia-Pacific parliamentary forum was established in January 1993 in
Tokyo, Japan, where the first annual meeting was held. The second was
held in Manila, the Philippines, in January 1994.
