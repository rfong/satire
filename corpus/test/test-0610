Three people shot dead near Moscow 
Three people were shot dead on Tuesday when gunmen with automatic
weapons fired on their vehicle in the town of Kolomna about 80
kilometres (50 miles) southeast of the Russian capital, police said
here.
A police spokesman, quoted by the news agency Interfax, attributed the
killings to gang warfare.
Gangland-style or contract killings have become increasingly common in
Russia, and particularly in Moscow.
Earlier Tuesday, Radio Echo Moscow reported the killing of Alexei
Khropov, the director of an independent local radio station, whose body
was identified on Monday after being discovered in a car here several
days ago.
Russia's acting prosecutor-general, Alexei Ilyushenko, said this month
that the number of premeditated murders had increased more than
four-fold in Moscow over the past five years, and more than doubled
throughout Russia.
Public anger and fear at the increase of crime, particularly murders
related to organised crime, have increased sharply following the
purportedly contract killing of popular television personality
Vladislav Listyev here on March 1.
