Tina Yothers Fantasy Camp Files For Bankruptcy
After three years of heavy financial losses, the Tina Yothers Fantasy Camp
finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Friday.  The camp--which allowed
Yothers fans to fulfill their dreams by performing scenes from Family Ties,
dressing up like an actual L.A.  Laker Girl and socializing with former
Yothers co-stars like Michael Gross--got off to a shaky start in 1995, when
only one customer paid $800 to attend the two-week camp. "We are deeply
disappointed by the public's lukewarm reaction to the camp," director
Edward Boros said.  "Frankly, it's baffling." The camp's owners are hoping
to recoup their losses with a series of Esther Rolle-themed luxury cruises.
