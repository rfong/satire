Bangladesh to shut, merge 500 branches of nationalised banks
Bangladesh's central bank announced Sunday it would shut or merge some
500 branches of nationalised banks across the country in a bid to end
losses running into the millions of dollars.
"We will carry out the closure or merger of about 500 branches of six
state-owned banks in three phases across the country," Fukhruddin
Ahmed, the Bangladesh Bank's governor, told reporters.
He said the move, to be completed by the end of December, was part of a
government effort to revamp the impoverished country's sluggish
economy.
"This step should have been taken a long time back and we could have
avoided the losses that run into millions," he said.
The closing and merger of the banks comes a month after Dhaka agreed to
several harsh measures, including the closing down of loss-making bank
branches, massive privatisation and a suspension of government
recruitment at a donors meeting in Paris.
The donors said they would watch Bangladesh closely for the next year
before delivering fresh aid, according to finance ministry officials.
But Ahmed denied the step was ordered under pressure from donor
countries or international financial bodies.
The central bank chief said there has been no decision to merge any of
the six nationalised banks, which together have some 4,860 branches
across the country.
Ahmed said banks were short-staffed and that closing or merger of
branches would not lead to layoffs.
A high-ranking nationalised bank official, however, cautioned that the
merger and closure of branches may be blocked as the finance ministry
has not yet talked with the banks' politicised trade unions.
"I have doubts about how far we can go, as we are already receiving
letters urging us not to close or merge this or that branch," the
official told AFP.
The branches being considered for merger or closing have not made a
profit for at least five years or are within five kilometres (three
miles) of other branches of the same bank.
