Also hockey moms are usually less rabid than pit bulls
By Sarah Palin
Golly! Wasn't that something last night? Before this, the biggest crowd
I ever spoke to was a crowd of 94 on Inuit Awareness Day (43 if you
subtract huskies).
Did you like that barb about how being mayor of Wasila was like being a
community organizer except with responsibility. I didn't get into
specifics because my record speaks for itself:
* Keeping wolves away from our babies. The previous mayor, Chester
Bottomfields, lost 14 babies on his watch. Me? Only 8. That's a 57%
reduction I plan on taking to Washington.
* Fighting gentrification from the Anchorage city folk. We resisted
the cosmopolitan sway of greater Anchorage with their fancy Sports
Authority-bought Crossbows and their modern refrigeration methods.
* Budget management. And we did it while completely abolishing taxes.
The entire budget was raised by chili cook-off's and charity
kissing booths.
My other zinger was that line about the only difference between a
hockey mom and a pit bull was lipstick. Truth be told, there are a few
other differences:
* Pit bulls can't comprehend sports, let alone hockey.
* Although rabies runs fairly rampant in both demographics, it's
slightly more prevalent in pit bulls.
* Female pit bulls carry themselves with a refinement and grace that
hockey moms can't really touch.
Oh and I had one more joke that the speech writers wouldn't let me say
last night: My deaf and dumb baby has more executive experience than
Barack Obama! Zing!!
