Iran and Iraq to exchange bodies of soldiers 
Iran and Iraq are due to go ahead on Tuesday with a large-scale
exchange of bodies of soldiers killed during their 1980-88 war, the
press reported on Sunday.
The swap of the remains of 60 Iranian and 77 Iraqi soldiers will take
place in Shalamsheh on the southern border between the two countries,
it said.
The exchanges are part of a bilateral agreement to repatriate the
bodies of fallen soldiers. In the most recent operation in
mid-November, the two swapped 40 Iranian soldiers and 99 Iraqi troops.
Remains of around 24,000 Iranian fighters have been found since the
August 1988 ceasefire.
The issue of prisoners of war and the missing in action is the main
obstacle to efforts to normalize ties between Tehran and Baghdad.
Iran on Thursday made a dramatic appeal to Iraq to take steps to
resolve the POW issue.
"This is a human issue which should not be politicized," the head of
Iran's POW commission, General Abdollah Najafi, told a press
conference. "If Iraq had a more sincere attitude, the issue could have
been solved more quickly."
Late last month Iran unilaterally handed over 724 prisoners of war to
Iraq in a "goodwill" gesture aimed at settling the dispute.
Iraq claims to have released all of the Iranians taken captive during
the war and says Iran is holding 20,000 Iraqis prisoners.
Iran, for its part, claims that at least 5,000 of its soldiers are
still in Iraq.
