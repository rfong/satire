Mexico, Germany Sign Agreement on Air Traffic 
An agreement to liberalize air routes between Mexico and Germany has
been signed, a Lufthansa airline official said here today.
The deal replaces a 30-year-old agreement on air traffic between the
two countries, Dieter Rohde, general director of the German airline
said.
He said commercial relations and the number of European travelers to
Mexico should increase with the signing of the new agreement.
