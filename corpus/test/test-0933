Kiki Flores is crying. The children at school made fun of her Mexican
accent when she gave a speech in which she said ``Lady
(italics)LEEH-ber-tee (end italics) was a (italics)geehft(end italics)
from France.''
Now, she thinks, her best friends, whom she sees every day in a magical
place called Puzzleworks, seem to be laughing at the way she recites a
tongue twister.
The conflict is but one of many that the Public Broadcasting System
will be examining in a television series ``The Puzzleworks,'' which
starts in January.
In the show, children's lessons in getting along with their peers come
wrapped in an upbeat layer of social realism that reveals some of the
ways that people are different.
In this episode, Kiki is ultimately comforted by her friends, who come
to appreciate her ability to speak a foreign language.
Dressed as a space traveler with her long brown hair poking through a
collander that she has plopped on her head, she fantasizes about living
on a far-off planet where ``everyone speaks as I do and nobody laughs
at anybody's accent.''
Julie Woo, her Chinese-American friend, runs to comfort her.
``Everybody has an accent,'' she says. ``In America, there are about a
million zillion different accents.''
Kiki is not consoled.
Her other friends are at a loss. How can they make her understand that
they weren't laughing at her at all and get her to play with them
again?
They build a spaceship, dress up in outlandish tin costumes and offer
her a lift to the planet she so badly wants to escape to.
On the way there, they learn she is bilingual, and that the reason she
speaks accented English is that Spanish was the language she learned
first.
Quick cut to footage of real children, demonstrating their own prowess
with language.
``I speak English and Korean,'' says one.
``I speak English and Persian,'' volunteers another.
``I read and write in English, but I sign in American sign language,''
the last child in the series says.
Back at Puzzleworks, Kiki's friends are impressed that she can do
everything in two languages -- even feed her cat. Soon, she forgets
about running away and decides to stick around to play with the other
children.
The episode concludes with Kiki's singing to a salsa beat, ``We're
living in a very small world. We've got to learn to understand one
another.'' The other puppets join in for the refrain.
