Philippine President's Son Escapes Ambush 
The Philippine president's son Jojo Ejercito and Sasmuan Mayor Lina
Bagasina escaped death Tuesday when their group was ambushed by still
unidentified suspects in Barangay(village) Malusak, Sasmuan of Pampanga
Province.
However, reporter Vincent Rodriguez who was with the Bagasina party was
shot dead, said a report of the state-run Philippine News Agency.
Ejercito's bodyguard, Manuel Musni, was wounded along with Anette
Manaang, a staff member of Mayor Bagasina.
Emmanuel Ferrer, one of the mayor's supporters, said the incident
happened at around 3:30 p.m. when Mayor Bagasina and Ejercito were on
their way back to Sasmuan aboard a speedboat when they were ambushed.
Mayor Bagasina assumed the mayorship of Sasmuan on May 10 after the
Pampanga Regional Trial Court ruled in her favor in an election protest
she filed against her rival, unseated Mayor Fernando Baltazar.
The Pampanga police has not arrested any suspect yet in the ambush
attempt.
