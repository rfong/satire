End of BCCI trial could soon be in sight: lawyer 
A United Arab Emirates (UAE) appeals court on Sunday adjourned for a
week the trial of several BCCI defendants convicted of embezzlement,
laywers said, but added the end could soon be in sight.
The court in Abu Dhabi said after a two-hour session behind closed
doors that the hearings will resume next Sunday, the lawyers announced.
"Today's trial focused on the civil charges against the defendants. The
trial is gaining pace and it could end in a few weeks," one lawyer
said.
The trial of 13 former executives from the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce resumed in late 1995 after both the prosection and the defence
appealed earlier sentences by an Abu Dhabi court.
The verdicts covered prison terms ranging between three to 14 years and
an order for the defendants to pay around nine billion dollars in
damages to the majority shareholders.
Only one of the present defendants, mostly Pakistanis with British
citizenship, is still in jail as the others have completed their prison
terms. But they have been ordered to stay in the UAE for the trial.
Former BCCI chief executive Mohammed Swaleh Naqvi, who got the stiffest
sentence by the Abu Dhabi court, was jailed in the United States last
year in connection with the BCCI crisis after he was extradited by the
UAE.
BCCI founder, Agha Hassan Abedi, died in Pakistan in 1995. Another
absent defendant is Ziaudddin Ali Akbar, who was sentenced to six years
in jail by a British court in 1994 on charges related to the BCCI
problem.
Abu Dhabi, the main oil producer in the UAE, controled 77 percent of
BCCI, which was one of the biggest financial institutions in the world
before it was shut worldwide in July 1991 for allegations of massive
fraud.
Abu Dhabi has offered 1.8 billion dollars in compensation for the
nearly 250,000 creditors of BCCI. Payments are expected to start this
year after most of the bank's assets have been liquidated.
