Time-bomb destroyed following two recent explosions 
A time-bomb primed to explode was discovered and destroyed in a park in
Cambodia's second city Battambang, where 17 people were injured in two
previous blasts, a witness and a government official said Sunday.
Local people alerted the authorities after two hand grenades attached
to a Chinese-made timing device were found in the small city-centre
park Saturday, a government official said.
Western mine and ordnance disposal experts based in the city destroyed
the bomb by a controlled explosion after police had cordoned off the
area, a witness said.
Two similar devices exploded in the park late Thursday, injuring 17
people.
"It's the Khmer Rouge, they want to terrorise the people and
destabilise the situation," Battambang vice-governor Serey Kosal said.
The Chinese-made timing device indicated that the guerrillas were
responsible, he said.
