France to Investigate Health Problems of Gulf War Veterans 
French Defense and Health Ministries jointly announced Tuesday that
France will start investigating health problems among 25,000 soldiers
deployed in the 1990-1991 Gulf War, French daily Le Monde reported in
its Wednesday's edition.
The study, directed by Roger Salamon, professor of the National
Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM in French), will
question over recent health problems of all French troops that have
fought in the Gulf War from August 1990 to April 1991.
Salamon, who submitted a report on this issue on Monday, said that
based on his research, a symptom "unique and specific" to the Gulf War
does not exist, but some Gulf veterans do suffer from various symptoms
of health problems.
INSERM will also launch an investigation of mortality on French
veterans who were sent to the Balkans battlefield, said Le Monde.
The work will take years to accomplish and will give a definite
conclusion on human health risks by exposure to depleted uranium.
Of 700,000 Americans and 50,000 British deployed to the Gulf, many have
complained of declining health situation. Researches doubt these
symptoms might be caused by exposure to a number of substances,
including drugs and vaccines, pesticides, and smoke from oil burning
fires.
