China to send 15,000 troops to Hong Kong on handover date: report 
China plans to send 15,000 People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops into
Hong Kong when it regains the territory on July 1 1997, a weekly
magazine reported Wednesday.
Britain has tried to talk the Chinese side out of the idea and warned
such "a show of force" would unnerve the population, the Hong
Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review said.
But it added that the PLA seemed determined to mark the handover with a
major impact.
The weekly said British intelligence officials had told thier American
counterparts of such a plan by the PLA.
It has been China's intention to mark the 1997 return of the British
colony to Chinese sovereignty with a high-profile event.
The Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), China's agency for
coordinating the handover, on Sunday suggested the establishment of the
committee to oversee the handover commemorations.
It has also recommended that a monument be erected in the centre of
Hong Kong to mark the event.
Britain and China have not held discussions on what will happen on June
30, 1997, but Chinese officials have said they want a high-profile
event.
Visitors wishing to witness the historic ceremony could have a hard
time -- most hotels in the territory are already fully booked.
