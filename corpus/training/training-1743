Kuwaiti court sets Canadian murder trial for January 22 
A Kuwaiti court has set January 22 for the trial of six Filipinos
accused of murdering Canadian Luc Ethier here in October, newspapers
reported Sunday.
Kuwait's interior ministry has named Filipino Teddy Tomaro as the
ringleader and said the group had planned to share Ethier's life
insurance money.
Tomaro will be tried for premeditated murder, the papers said. The
others, including Ethier's Filipina wife, Mary-Jane Bitos, are accused
of being accomplices in the murder.
A seventh Filipino arrested in connection with the case has been
released.
The suspects' Kuwaiti lawyer Ahmad Qurban told al-Rai al-Aam daily he
will ask the emirate's Criminal Court to release them on bail.
Ethier was fatally shot on October 10 as he walked with his wife
through a busy shopping area south of Kuwait City. Bitos was also shot
three times during the attack and insists she was forced to confess
under duress.
Soon after the murder, Majid al-Mutairi, a Kuwaiti Islamist, was held
as a suspect but released immediately after the Filipinos were
arrested.
