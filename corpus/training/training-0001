G7 meeting seen as "dollar's last hope" 
The Group of Seven summit meeting starting in Naples on Friday looked
like the dollar's last hope Thursday on the London foreign exchange
market, as the greenback remained weak following maintenance of current
levels of US and German interest rates, traders said.
The dollar got up to 1.5815 marks in the early afternoon, but stood in
late afternoon at 1.5715 compared with 1.5680 Wednesday evening in
London.
Chase Manhattan bank analyst Ian Gunner said the dollar was hurt in
late afternoon by profit-taking, as "operators prefer to take profits
every time the dollar strengthens". He said the dollar had benefited
during the day from operators' caution ahead of release Friday of US
job figures and of the G7 summit conclave in Italy.
"Market sentiment is still unfavorable to the dollar - but nobody wants
to be caught off base before the G7 in case, though it is unlikely, the
participants agree to support the dollar", said Gunner.
Economist Lee Ferridge at Natwest Capital Markets bank commented that
all G7 country leaders insist that no decision will be made on the
dollar, "so certain operators are starting to think it's a trap". Those
officials have said repeatedly that one should not expect too much from
the G7 parley in the exchange rate field.
While the Bundesbank and the Fed have not changed key interest rates
this week, analysts said the Fed might raise rates if there is a sharp
rise in US job creations, to be reported on Friday.
The mark's firmness weighed on other European currencies Thursday,
especially the Belgian franc because of the large Belgian brudget
deficit. The market peaked against the franc at 20.74 to the mark in
the morning, but stood in late afternoon at 20.67 against 20.68
Wednesday evening.
The mark traded at 996.15 lire agianst 994.25 Wednesday, and at 3.4360
French francs against 3.4370. It stood at 4.9779 Swedish kronor
compared with 5.0028 and at 3.9309 Danish kroner agianst 3.9341
following Wednesday's sharp runup against those currencies.
At 1600 GMT, the dollar was trading at 1.5715 marks (against 1.5680
Wednesday evening in London), 98.95 yen (98.15), 1.3260 Swiss francs
(1.3183), and 5.4063 French francs (5.3913).
Sterling stood at 1.5420 dollars (1.55), 2.4233 marks (2.4304), 152.58
yen (152.13), 2.0447 Swiss francs (2.0439), and 8.3364 French francs
(8.3586).
Gold was up slightly to 384.25 dollars an ounce against 384 Wednesday.
The three-month Eurodollar was down to 4.8125 percent against 4.875,
while the British three-month interbank rate was unchanged at 5.1875
percent.
