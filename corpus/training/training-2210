Indonesian telecoms giant plans 1998 satellite launch 
Indonesian state-owned telecommunication giant PT Telkom is planning to
launch a new satellite by the end of 1998 to replace another currently
in orbit, reports said Monday.
Telkom president A.A. Nasution, speaking in the northern Sumatra city
of Banda Aceh Friday, said the new satellite would replace the Palapa
B2R, which will end its service in 1999, the Kompas daily reported.
Telkom, which provides domestic and international communication
services, would replace the B2R with either another B generation
satellite or one of the yet to be produced D series models.
The final decision would be made by the government, Telkom's biggest
shareholder, a company spokesman said.
Four foreign companies -- Hughes and Lockheed of the United States and
Aerospatial and Marconi Matra from Europe -- are contending for the new
satellite contract, Nasution said.
US-based Hughes Space and Communication Corporation has manufactured
all of Indonesia's Palapa satellites. The satellites have a combined
footprint covering most of southeast Asia and carry general
telecommunications, as well as Indonesian and foreign television
broadcasts.
Telkom officials earlier said the D series would replace B generation
models as they came out of service.
Indonesia currently has four Palapa satellites in orbit, three of the B
generation and two of the C series.
An archipelago of more than 13,000 islands, Indonesia depends largely
on rocket-launched satellites for telecommunications.
Launches have all been conducted outside Indonesia.
