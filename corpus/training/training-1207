Uganda Hailed Top User Of Kenyan Port 
The managing director of the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) Simeon Mkalla
on Tuesday hailed Uganda "number one transit user" of the Kenyan port
of Mombasa.
Mkalla made the remark when meeting the Ugandan high commissioner to
Kenya Joseph Tomusange at the port.
Tomusange said Ugandan customers were satisfied with delivery service
and other improved services at the Mobasa port.
He told the KPA official there would be an increased amount of Ugandan
cargo at the port with the coming of business boom in Uganda in 1995.
The Ugandan envoy, who was accompanied by representatives from leading
transit cargo companies and parastatals, said Uganda viewed efficient
operations of the port as key to its economic growth.
He singled out the closer cooperation the Ugandan companies have forged
with the KPA as an inspiration to good business.
