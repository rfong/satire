Sir Stan to play again at 80 
Soccer legend Sir Stanley Matthews is to play again -- at the age of
80!
The former England wing wizard, won 54 caps from the age of 19 to the
unbelievable age of 41, will play 15 minutes for Beazer Homes League
club Clevedon Town in a friendly match against Bristol City on Sunday,
July 30.
Clevedon's manager, Steve Fey, met Sir Stanley when he spoke at a
dinner in the Somerset town early in the summer.
"It was a bit cheeky but as a joke I asked him if he would consider
signing on as a player for us," said Fey.
"I nearly fell backwards when he said 'yes' but I jumped at the chance.
I had a Beazer League registration form with me, hoping to sign another
player, so I got Sir Stanley to sign it there and then.
"I asked him what he had earned in the 1953 FA Cup final and he told me
4. 18 shillings.
"I offered him double that, threw in a little extra and got him for a
tenner. It has to be the steal of the century!"
Matthews, immortalised by the so called 'Matthews FA Cup Final' in
1953, was the first footballer awarded the CBE (Commander of the
British Empire) in 1957 and the first to be knighted in 1965.
The match at the Hand Stadium is in honour of Clevedon's retiring
president Doug Hand and entrance is free.
