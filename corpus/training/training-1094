Yeltsin calls for balanced budget by 1999 
President Boris Yeltsin called for a balanced budget by 1999, excluding
debt servicing, in his annual address to parliament Thursday as quoted
by the ITAR-TASS news agency.
Yeltsin said he would take the budget under his personal control and
had given the government three months to come up with a programme for
launching the anti-deficit fight, ITAR-TASS said.
The budget must also create a base for industrial investment and
economic growth, Yeltsin said. From 1998, all budget funds will go into
a single treasury account, he said.
Yeltsin has strongly criticised the current budget, echoing warnings
from liberal parliament deputies that its targets, particularly on the
revenue side, are unrealistic.
Projected revenue for 1997 was set at 434.4 trillion rubles (79.18
billion dollars) -- 25 percent higher than in the 1996 budget, which
proved over-optimistic, with tax revenue amounting to less than 65
percent of the target figure.
