Investors Urged to Mine In Zambia 
Foreign and local investors have been challenged to venture into
Zambia's gemstone mining if they are to achieve maximum financial
benefit.
Margaret Mwanakatwe, acting director-general of Zambia Investment
Center (ZIC), said in a latest issue of Zambian Investor magazine that
apart from copper mining, other opportunities exist in the mining
sector and the greatest potential lies in the gemstone sector,
government-owned Zambia Daily Mail reported Friday.
She noted that it is up to investors to venture into the country's
gemstone industry which has an international advantage if they are to
make benefit.
Zambia's gemstone sector that includes emeralds, amethyst, aquamarine
and tourmaline, garnets and rose quartz has great potential, said the
ZIC chief.
She added that Zambia's export value of emeralds is currently estimated
at 200 million U.S. Dollars per year which is about 20 percent of the
world's production.
This sector, however, has been adversely hampered by a lack of serious
investment and is generally run by small companies and individuals.
Mwanakatwe noted that Zambia now needs serious foreign players who will
establish as partners to existing domestic investors in order to
increase production and process the gemstones for added value.
Zambia has other viable mineral endowments which include cobalt,
ferrous metals and precious metals, she said.
