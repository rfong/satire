Berlusconi backs Parmalat "heroes"
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has rushed to the defence of
top Parmalat officials arrested for multi-billion euro fraud,
describing them as "national heroes".
Instead, Berlusconi firmly laid the blame at the door of Italian
farmers to whom the stricken dairy products company now owes 120m
euros.
"I'm sure they've been sneaking out wads of cash through the Parmalat
gates in their filthy, stinking tractors," he said.
Berlusconi has announced a national day of mourning for former Parmalat
boss Calisto Tanzi and chief financial officers Fausto Tonna and
Luciano Del Soldato who were detained by police after 10bn euros went
missing at the company.
"I will do everything in my power to get these men released," promised
Berlusconi. "I just need a bit of time to install a crooked judge and
bribe a few witnesses."
