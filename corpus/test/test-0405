Iran Rejects Argentina's Terrorist Charge 
Iran Tuesday once again rejected Argentina's accusation that Tehran was
involved in the 1994 bomb attack on a Jewish center in Buenos Aires,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi dismissed as
"baseless" the recent charge raised by Argentine prosecutor Eamon
Mullen that the then Iranian cultural attache to Argentina had been
involved in the bomb attack which killed 88 people and injured 159
others.
IRNA quoted him as saying that the Zionist (Israeli) circles in
Argentina attributed the bombing to Iran in an attempt to cover up the
opposition of the Argentine people to the influence of the Zionists on
their country.
Argentina had already charged four Argentine policemen with the bombing
and this indicated that terrorism is an internal phenomenon in
Argentina, he said, adding that attributing it to a foreign country is
a step to escape from the truth.
After the bombing, an Iranian national offered information to the
Argentine authorities claiming that some Iranian diplomats were
involved in the bombing. However, no enough evidence was found to
support the accusation during the past three years.
