Dollar gains ground, gold jumps 
The dollar gained ground against most major currencies except the Swiss
franc at midday Thursday as traders awaited remarks from the US trade
representative on Japan.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 387.50 dollars an ounce, up 2.70 dollars from
late Wednesday.
At about 1:20 p.m. (1720 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.5864 German marks
against 1.5945 marks earlier and 1.5860 late Wednesday.
Against the yen, it was quoted at 98.80 from 98.79 earlier and 98.75
Wednesday.
The dollar had fallen to an all-time low of 98.40 against the yen
during the morning session, and traders were expecting US Trade
Representative Mickey Kantor to announce retaliatory measures against
Japan to pressure Tokyo to open its markets, a Credit Lyonnais analyst
said.
The US currency rose to 5.4364 French francs, up from 5.4355 late
Wednesday, and to 0.6476 pound sterling (0.6472), but edged down to
1.3335 Swiss francs (1.3337).
The dollar did not rise above 1.5960 marks and weakness on the bond
market prompted selloffs, according to Chase Manhattan Bank's Paul
Farrell.
The greenback could rally against the mark, but its performance against
the yen would be hard to predict, he added.
