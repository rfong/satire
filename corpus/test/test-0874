Christina Aguilera writes a letter to Brazilian government
Christina Aguilera in an unprecedented move wrote a letter to the
Brazilian government to raise their consciousness over the Brazilian
prison system.
Christina who is not new to publicity stunts told a reporter that she
was in love with a "Candy Man" living inside of a Brazilian prison. She
refused to tell reporters his name, but it's reported she sends him a
supply of items every month that includes love letters and pictures of
her.
We managed to get a hold of the letter she had send the Brazilian
government:
___________________________________________________________________
I am writing this letter to show good will to mankind.
Do not allow foreign doctors to establish a practice of medicine in
Brazil because they are antagonistic towards Brazilian citizenship.
Inviting a foreign doctor as a guest to perform an operation and the
government compensating him is a sign of friendship and does not cause
harm to Brazilians. You have to be intelligent about every situation so
you can understand the microscopic details about life itself.
The loyalty of foreign doctors is to their own birthplace. The health
of the Brazilian people is too valuable for you to sacrifice Brazilians
to foreign doctors.
Also I have heard that foreign intelligence agencies are purposely
infiltrating other countries by planting their doctors into foreign
lands to keep the citizenship of that foreign land under control with
the use of fear, paranoia and intimidation so they can control world
policies and policies within those lands. If a foreign doctor or
foreign clinics offer free medical services then you know their
intentions are good because they are trying to help the poor. If a
foreign doctor or clinic charges money for their services then you know
their intentions are not good and they most likely will cover up the
abuses they commit by saying the person was poor.
To keep a good supply of doctors in Brazil you must give free medical
schools to Brazilian children so Brazil will never lack doctors.
Next, you have to mix men and women in the same prison to prevent
genocide of the Brazilian people. You can do this in different ways.
1. You can create hatcheries to have a supply of women to place into
men's prisons in Brazil. Then keep two types of prison: One for
Brazilian men in society and one for Brazilian women in society.
Example:
Brazilian men--Hatchery women
Brazilian women--Brazilian women
2. You can mix Brazilian men and women in the same prison cells.
3. You can mix Brazilian men and women in the same prison and you can
mix hatchery women with Brazilian men in the same prison.
4. You can put four hatchery women into a cell with one male prisoner.
Give them an exercise bike, and exercise equipment. You can have
them do work six hours a day in isolated work compartments in the
form of a factory.
There must be constant access to a female to comply with the Genocide
Laws.
Genocide Laws:
Article II: In the present Convention, genocide means any of the
following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a
national, ethical, racial or religious group, as such:
(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
Article III: The following acts shall be punishable:
(a) Genocide;
(b) Conspiracy to commit genocide;
(c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide;
(d) Attempt to commit genocide;
(e) Complicity in genocide.
Based on the Law, the Brazilian government can be taken before a United
Nations court where Brazil would lose because they keep men in prison
without women. With the use of the prison system, the Brazilian
government is imposing measures intended to prevent births within the
group.
You might have to release Brazilian men from all the prisons and you
will have to close down all the male prisons in Brazil.
If you do close all the prisons in Brazil, you will have to punish men
with taking money out of their work wages so they can pay for crimes
they have committed. This will prevent them from committing crimes
because they don't want to lose parts of their wages.
If men do not want to work to escape punishment, then you can put them
to work in work camps. These men can get free prison clothing they can
wear in society and they can get three meals a day at the work camps.
By law, they would be forced to show up for an eight hour shift at the
work camps and all the money they make would go to the Brazilian
government so it can be used to prevent crime in Brazil.
The men will stay free in society where they can procreate with women.
This sounds better because Brazil will save millions of dollars in
prison cost and they will actually make billions of dollars from the
work camps.
If they do not show, up for work, you can find them, bring them to the
work camp, and extend their sentenced workdays or you can take away
their cars or personal belongings to sell to make up for the lost
workdays.
