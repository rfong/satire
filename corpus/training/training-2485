Primakov Pledges More Support for Coal Industry 
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Monday promised to double
state funding for the coal industry and urged miners to cooperate with
the government in getting over the current difficulties, Itar-Tass
reported.
The government will raise this year's state subsidy to the coal
industry from 5.8 billion rubles (255 million U.S. dollars) to 10- 12
billion rubles (439-527 million dollars), Primakov told an
extraordinary session of the All-Russia Miners' Congress in Moscow.
"Unity between trade unions, the government and local authorities is
necessary. Nothing will happen without that," Primakov said. "Let's not
scare each other, Mutual threats will yield no results."
He also called for "decisive action to improve the situation in the
coal industry," where miners seldom receive their wages more than once
every five months on the average. In some enterprises, wage arrears
have lasted for 12-13 months.
It is reported that disgruntled miners resorted to blocking railroads
last year to press the government and their employers for payment of
back wages.
While admitting that the federal government should take some blame for
the plight of the industry, Primakov pointed his finger at economic
crimes and misuse of funds that have plagued the sector in recent
years. As a result, billions of dollars in coal- export proceeds failed
to return to Russia.
"That is the money which should have paid the miners," he said.
Primakov reiterated that his government's policy of developing the
domestic industry as a top priority. He also listed tax reform, banking
system restructuring, and the improvement of the investment environment
as its main tasks.
