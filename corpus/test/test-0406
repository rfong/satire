Brochard Wins Paris-Nice First Stage 
French rider Laurent Brochard, riding for the Jean Delatour team, on
Sunday won the first stage of the Paris-Nice cycling event, a
7.9-kilometer time trial around eastern Paris.
Brochard, the 1997 world road champion, clocked nine minutes 32. 27
seconds to beat Britain's Chris Boardman by less than a second.
Estonian Lauri Aus finished third.
A professional since 1992, Brochard had never previously won a time
trial.
