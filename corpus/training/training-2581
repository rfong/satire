BBC films Algeria's hidden war 
Algeria's Islamic fundamentalist rebels are well-armed and organised
and in complete control of areas of the country, a BBC television
documentary showed late Saturday.
Members of the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) were shown moving around in
total freedom in the mountainous region of Chlef in western Algeria,
where they have set up a field hospital headed by a qualified doctor, a
communications centre equipped with computers and fax machines, and a
bomb factory.
One man, his face hidden, was filmed making a bomb "with our own
methods" from a gas cylinder, while another militant, interviewed in
the town street, explained why the Islamic groups killed foreign
workers in Algeria.
If western governments stopped supporting the regime, it would collapse
in two weeks," he said. "The foreigners were warned to leave, and they
didn't."
While the BBC team of journalist Phil Rees and an Egyptian camera crew
failed to interview members of the more radical Armed Islamic Group
(GIA), it showed they were also present in the area and that relations
were good with the AIS, armed wing of the banned Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS).
"We cooperate fully on the ground," an AIS militant said.
Rees also spoke in Algiers and Blida, south of the capital, with
lawyers who defended the fundamentalists, journalists who were among
their targets, and ordinary people caught in the middle of the
conflict, and for whom fear and intimidation has become part of their
daily life.
The FIS and GIA have been waging a guerrilla campaign against the
government since the army stepped in to cancel January 1992
second-round elections that the Front was poised to win.
More than 10,000 people have died in the ensuing violence.
