Chinese Leaders Attend Meeting of Scientists, Skilled Workers 
Scientists should use their theoretical and practical knowledge to help
workers improve their skills, according to Wei Jianxing, Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC).
Wei, who is also member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee
and president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), made
the remarks here today during a meeting between scientists and skilled
workers.
The meeting was a major event during China's International Week for
Science and Peace.
Wei noted that the 15th National Congress of the CPC set a goal of
advancing the cause of building a socialism with Chinese
characteristics. He noted that achieving the goal will require a large
number of scientists and hundreds of thousands of skilled workers.
He called on scientists to exhibit greater concern about the scientific
and technological activities of the workers throughout China.
Wei expressed his hope that scientists and skilled workers will learn
each other and contribute greatly to the implementation of the CPC
Central Committee's strategy of using science and technology to
rejuvenate the country.
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, and He Luli, vice-chairwoman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,
also attended the meeting.
The meeting was sponsored by the ACFTU. Some skilled workers
demonstrated their skills during the meeting.
