Kenya Holds Essay Competition to Mark Ozone Day 
The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) announced here Thursday
the winners of Kenyan students' essay competition to commemorate the
International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer.
The ozone day is celebrated every year on September 16 in more than 170
countries around the world.
Deputy Executive Director of UNEP, Shafqat Kakahel, presented the
prizes at a special ceremony held in UNEP headquarters.
Responding enthusiastically to the theme "Save Our Sky: Be Ozone
Friendly," more than 20,000 essays have been submitted from every
corner of the east African country.
"Many of these entries were excellent. So excellent that two first
prizes had to be awarded," said Madhava Sarma, Executive Secretary of
the UNEP Ozone Secretariat.
The competition was organized by UNEP, in collaboration with the Kenyan
government.
