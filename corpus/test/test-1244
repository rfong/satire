Philippines' Economy Posts 2.9 Pct Growth in First Half 
The Philippines posted a 2.4 percent growth in gross domestic product
(GDP) and 2.9 percent growth in gross national product (GNP)
respectively in the first semester of 1999, the Philippine government
said Friday in a report.
According to the report released by the National Statistical
Cooperation Board, the GNP and GDP grew by 3.8 percent and 3.6 percent
respectively in the second quarter, "twice stronger than the first
quarter's 2 percent and 1.2 percent."
GNP is the value of goods and services produced by the economy,
including income from abroad, while GDP is GNP minus overseas income.
The report attributed the good performance of the economy mainly to the
6.6 percent growth rate of the combined agriculture, fishery and
forestry sector as a result of the predominantly rainy weather
conditions.
The services sector continued its positive run, although at a slightly
slower pace compared with last year, with a 3.5 percent growth for this
semester, said the report.
The industry sector, on the other hand, contracted even further
relative to the same period of last year with a negative growth rate of
1.4 percent.
On the expenditure side, only personal consumption expenditure and
government consumption expenditure registered positive growth.
Exports of goods and services in real peso prices posted growth during
the second quarter but was not enough to buffer its decline during the
first quarter, as it shrank by 5.4 percent for the whole semester, said
the report.
Imports of goods and services in real peso prices also grew by 0.4
percent during the second quarter but was not adequate to offset its
reduction during the first quarter. Hence it declined by 11.2 percent
in the first semester of 1999.
Felipe Medalla, secretary of the Social Economic Planning Department,
said that based on these figures, he is confident that the country
could post the whole year growth targets of 3.0-3.7 percent in GNP and
2.6-3.2 percent in GDP.
