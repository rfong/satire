Albanian MP Arrested for Shooting at Rival Lawmaker 
The Tirana police arrested an Albanian Socialist parliamentary member
today who shot at a rival lawmaker at the parliament, local reports
said.
Azem Hajdari of the opposition Democratic Party was shot and seriously
wounded by Gafur Mazreku two days after the two exchanged blows during
a parliamentary session.
After the shooting, some pro-Democrats gathered in front of the
buildings of the parliament and the headquarters of the Democratic
Party, shouting slogans in protest against the shooting incident.
The Albanian interior ministry, the Tirana police and special forces
have taken measures to keep the capital calm, reports said.
Prime Minister Fatos Nano ruled out any political nature in the
shooting, saying that it was an "ordinary crime" and Mazreku would be
responsible for it.
He said everybody in the country is equal before law and the
parliamentary member who shot must be punished by the law.
Nano added that Albania needs peace and the Albanian people need
stability.
