Former Indian actress Jayalalitha back in power 
Former actress Jayalalitha Jayaram was Saturday sworn in as chief
minister of southern India's Tamil Nadu state, just five months after
she was forced to step down from the post over corruption charges.
Jayalalitha took her oath of office in a colourful ceremony at the
Madras University centenary hall, packed with hundreds of her political
supporters.
The controversial Jayalalitha was forced to step down as chief minister
in September on the grounds that she was not a sitting member of the
state legislature.
She had been barred from contesting elections in Tamil Nadu last May --
in which her party swept to power -- because of her corruption
convictions, relating to her previous 1991-1996 tenure as chief
minister.
In February 2000, she was sentenced to one year's hard labour but only
served two months in jail. The convictions were later overturned,
paving the way for her comeback.
