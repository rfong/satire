Washington condemns award of medal to Bosnian Croat war crimes suspect 
Washington on Tuesday condemned Zagreb's award of a medal to a Bosnian
Croat general held by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague on
suspicion of war crimes.
Croatia awarded the medal to General Tolimir Blaskic for his
participation in the August 1995 operation in which the Croatian army
recaptured most of the country from separatist Serb forces.
"This action by the government of Croatia raises questions about that
government's commitment to work with the tribunal," said State
Department spokesman Glyn Davies.
"And it does raise questions about their commitment to Dayton," he
added, referring to the November 1995 Bosnian peace accord.
Blaskic is charged with being individually responsible, as commander of
the Bosnian Croat HVO militia force, for crimes committed by his troops
between January 1993 and April 1994.
He also is charged with five other Bosnian Croats for the massacre of
about 100 Moslem civilians.
Blaskic has been detained by the UN tribunal since he turned himself in
in April. The medal was presented to his wife last week.
