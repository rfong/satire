Nigerian inflation drops to 16.5 percent 
Inflation in Nigeria fell to 16.5 percent in the year to end December
from 17.4 percent in the previous 12 months, the Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS) said Monday.
P8l consumer price index rose by 16.5 percent between December 2000 and
December 2001, down from the 17.4 percent seen in ii5#12 months to the
end of November, the FOS said.
Increases in the prices of household goods, clothing and transport
fares had been offset by falls in the prices of basic foodstuffs and
kerosene, used for cooking.
Inflation rose in Nigeria in the second half of 2001 due to higher
government spending which pumped money into circulation.
The Central Bank of Nigeria has in recent months raised the minimum
rediscount rate from 18.5 percent to 20.5 percent and sought to cut
money supply.
