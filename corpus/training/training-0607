Zhu Rongji on Laid-Off Workers (3)
Zhu said that ensuring the basic livelihoods of laid-off workers is
essential before finding new jobs for them. In this sense, the
establishment of re-employment service centers is an effective measure.
All enterprises which lay off workers must set up re-employment service
centers or similar organizations, which will be responsible for
providing basic living expenses, paying social insurance fees for them,
organizing vocational training and helping them obtain new jobs.
In principle, one third of social insurance funds should come from
fiscal budgets of central and local governments, one third from
enterprises and the remainder from other sectors of the society.
However, the proportions may vary in different localities. Poor areas
will get financial assistance from the central government, the premier
said.
Zhu pointed out that retired workers from state enterprises should be
guaranteed comfort in their remaining years, because they have made
great contributions to the country. Pensions must be paid on time, and
any delayed part must be paid retroactively.
In this regard, legislation will be stepped up to ensure the collection
of pension funds, which can only be used to buy treasury bonds. Anyone
embezzling, misusing or wasting such funds will be severely punished.
In addition, workers in state-owned enterprises may not retire before
the legal age to do so, according to Zhu.
The premier explained that old-age and unemployment insurance,
guarantee of basic livelihoods for laid-off workers and basic living
expenses for urban residents are the three complementary systems of the
Chinese-style social security mechanism under the present conditions.
In the long term, a comprehensive social security system covering all
workers will be set up, he said.
