China Vows to Improve Quality of Medicine 
China has vowed to improve the quality of medical products this year by
streamlining its pharmaceutical industry, stepping up reform of medical
distribution, and standardizing the medicine market, a senior medical
official said.
"The quality of medical products has a great bearing on the health of
the Chinese nation," said Zheng Xiaoyu, director of the State
Pharmaceutical Administration, stressing the importance of intensifying
a sense of quality and tightening control of pharmaceutical production.
It is the sacred duty of medical workers to ensure that people use
medicine in a safe, effective and convenient way, and to safeguard the
rights and interests of consumers, Zheng said in a report delivered to
a national working conference of pharmaceutical directors.
In the report, Zheng urged all medical workers to redouble their
efforts to provide society with the best products and a first-class
service.
In 1996 the total output value of China's pharmaceutical industry
reached 120 billion yuan, with the sales of medical products hitting 88
billion yuan, and pre-tax profits rising up to 12 billion yuan, the
director said.
Great achievements have been made in the reform of marketing and
distribution of medical products in the past year, he said, adding that
illegal manipulations of trading of medical products have been curbed,
and the order of medicine production and marketing improved.
In addition, he said, the supply and management of medicine in China's
rural areas have gradually been enhanced, and a new wholesale and
nationwide retail system of medical products has improved.
