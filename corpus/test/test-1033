Chinese Scholar Defends China's Human Rights Record
On the issue of political democracy, some Western states think that
democracy means every individual has the right to express views and to
seek interests.
However, China holds that an individual's right doesn't mean everything
of democracy although it is indispensable. Democracy should include the
rights to act in accordance with the opinions and interests of the
majority of people.
The West usually judges the conditions of democracy in some countries
by the extent of individual rights instead of paying attention to
whether the masses' opinions are accepted and their demands satisfied.
That is why some Western states failed to see that China's rapid
economic development resulted from satisfaction of the majority
people's demands, which is the embodiment of democracy.
The West also advocates for their model of multi-party election,
separation of the three powers (the legislative, executive and judicial
powers) and the parliamentary system of two houses, saying only this is
democracy.
But, China believes that in view of China's specific conditions, the
People's Congress system can embody more democracy because China's
rapid growth in the past decades is a result of carrying out the
policies, plans and programs approved by the Chinese People's Congress.
It demonstrates that the Chinese People's Congress can guarantee the
demands of the masses of people are truly satisfied. The Chinese people
demand rapid development. The West, which judges China by its own
democratic concept and mode, naturally can not find the kind of
democracy in China it preaches.
On the issue of peace and security, the Chinese people, for the sake of
rapid development, badly need a peaceful and friendly international
environment because China is unlikely to develop without a peaceful and
friendly international environment.
The Chinese people will never be so foolish as to devastate their
development by doing something which will threaten the world peace and
security.
However, some Western nations, which are seeking to expand their sphere
of influence, view China's development as a threat to them. They failed
to see the fact that China's speedy development contributes to the
world peace and security, but also. And what is more, they also failed
to realize what sufferings will befall China and the world's peace and
security if China wanes again.
