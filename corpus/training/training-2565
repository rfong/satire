S. Africa's Release of Prisoners Criticized 
South African opposition parties have expressed shock at the
government's decision to release 9,000 convicts to mark President
Nelson Mandela's 80th birthday.
Correctional Services Minister Sipho Mzimela said Friday that prisoners
to be freed from Monday would be those who had six months or less to
serve in prisons. The release process would take about two weeks.
Mzimela said: "all sentenced inmates" would be granted six months
special remission of sentence.
In response, opposition parties said the government's decision was at
the cost of ordinary citizens who had long had to bear the brunt of
violent crime.
"This is not a happy birthday present for South Africa," local daily
the Citizen Saturday quoted Democratic Party spokesman James Selfe as
reporting.
National Party spokesman Gert Oosthuizen said: "It is amazing that
President Mandela decides to grant remission to all sentenced
inmates... it is unique that the head of state is in effect giving a
birthday present to sentenced criminals."
The United Democratic Movement also criticized the decision, describing
it as "rediculous".
According to Correctional Services Commissioner Khulekani Sitole, the
release of the prisoners would ease the pressure on accomodation. South
African prisons at the present had 148,000 inmates.
The ruling African National Congress led by President Mandela defended
the decision, saying that the decision to grant prisoners a six-month
remission would not have been taken lightly and without due
consideration of the best intersts of society.
the government would take whatever means necessary to ensure the
prisoners were properly reitegrated into society, the ANC said.
