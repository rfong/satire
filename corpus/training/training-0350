Increasing Number Of Movies Filmed In Hollywood of the East
Thailand has become a mecca for Hollywood producers looking for an
exotic setting, stunning landscapes and, in the case of Disney,
elephants roaming in real forests.
Once just a set for Vietnam War movies, the country is currently
hosting the filming of action flicks, ``The Quest'' and ``Cutthroat
Island.'' And Walt Disney Studios just wrapped up ``Dumbo Drop,'' a
dlrs 30-million movie set in Thailand's elephant-filled mountainous
north.
Moshe Diamant, producer of ``The Quest,'' said he chose Thailand as the
filming site because it ``captivated'' him.
``China would have been cheaper but you can't beat Thailand _ good
crews and personnel at all levels. They're very reliable and nice to
work with,'' Diamant said. ``The weather's perfect, the scenery's
stunning.''
Diamant says that the studios aren't the only ones benefiting from the
increasing use of Thailand as the Hollywood of the East. He estimates
that 40 percent of the film's dlrs 35 million budget goes into the
community for extras, food, hotels, and souvenirs.
``We're pumping a lot of money directly into the Thai economy,''
Diamant says from the set in Phuket, 690 kilometers (430 miles)
southwest of Bangkok.
Charlie Sungkawess, the Thai first assistant director on ``The Quest,''
has worked for some 30 Hong Kong and American films, such as ``Rambo
3,'' in which the opening was filmed in Thailand.
He had to turn down ``Cutthroat Island,'' to work on ``The Quest,''
directed and starred in by kick-boxing actor Jean-Claude Van Damme,
with Roger Moore, the former ``James Bond'' star.
``My favorite was probably, `Air America,' with Mel Gibson; very
relaxed atmosphere, very good crew, no pressure,'' says Sungkawess,
during a break from the filming. He worked on ``Dumbo Drop'' for
several months before taking on ``The Quest.''
As he talks, ``Cutthroat Island,'' a dlrs 60 million epic of piracy in
the 1600s, also is being produced and directed by Renny Harlin in the
turquoise waters of Phuket and its thickly-forested national park. The
film stars Geena Davis, Matthew Modine and Frank Langella.
International film-makers first began filming in Thailand, which
resembled Vietnam, to make Vietnam war movies. They were barred from
filming in the Communist country.
``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' with Robin Williams, ``Casualties of War''
with Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn, as well as ``Heaven and Earth,''
directed by Oliver Stone, were all shot in Thailand.
``The Killing Fields,'' about the Khmer Rouge's brutal reign in
Cambodia, also was filmed in Thailand because of government
restrictions, and a continuing civil war, in Cambodia.
But now Thailand is wanted more for itself than its resemblance to its
Indochinese neighbors. Last year, ``Mortal Kombat,'' a maga-bucks
Hollywood feature film, was shot on the lush tropical seashores of
Phuket.
``Cutthroat Island,'' a Carolco production, is scheduled for summer
release, with ``The Quest'' by Universal, to open in the United States
and Europe at Christmas.
``It's like a Christmas gift I want to give people,'' Van Damme said in
an interview in Phuket.
``I think they'll like the movie; it has adventure, action, romance, a
lot of heart,'' he said. `` And, while it's cold outside, maybe even
snowing, they'll be on holiday in the theater, seeing the great
scenery, the beautiful ocean off Phuket ... the sunshine of the
tropics.''
