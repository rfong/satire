Kurdish Leader Favors Iraqi Territorial Integrity 
Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in
northern Iraq, said here on Friday that a solution of the Iraqi problem
should be found within the framework of Iraq's territorial integrity.
Barzani made the statement shortly after his meeting with Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit, reported the Anatolia News Agency. Barzani
described his meeting with the prime minister as " very positive and
beneficial."
Barzani told reporters that they discussed problems related to Iraq's
present and future position and the two sides were of the same opinion
about Iraq's territorial integrity.
Barzani said that Ecevit told him that Turkey attaches vital importance
to the regional security and stability, adding that they shared the
same view.
When asked whether or not Ecevit requested them to establish warm
relations with Baghdad, Barzani said that they will adopt a decision
about the kind of relations they will establish with Baghdad.
After last month's visit by Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader
Jalal Talabani to Turkey, the KDP leader arrived in Ankara on Wednesday
and met with undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry Faruk Logoglu on
Thursday.
Turkey has always advised the two Iraqi Kurdish parties to continue
dialogue with Baghdad and not to pursue independence, as certain
western states have instigated, for fear that a Kurdish state should
involve Kurds living in Turkey, Iraq and Iran.
