EU hopes Mugabe will "hear voice of international community" 
The European Union hopes Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe will take
heed of international criticism of questionable elections that kept him
in power and resulted in Zimbabwe's suspension from the Commonweath, a
European Commission spokeswoman said Wednesday.
He said the EU was "satisfied that the Commonwealth shares its analysis
that the elections were neither free nor fair," she said.
The surprise suspension came after the London-based 54-nation group
failed to reach agreement on sanctions against Harare before the
voting, when African leaders rallied around the anti-colonialist
Mugabe, who has held power since independence from Britain in 1980.
The EU spokeswoman refused to comment on the suspension, calling it "an
internal decision" of the Commonwealth, but added the union "hoped
Mugabe will listen to the voice of the international community" calling
for the democratisation of the country.
Relations between the EU and Zimbabwe had been deteriorating steadily
in the months before the March 9-11 vote, culminating in "targeted
sanctions" against Mugabe's regime, accused of attempting to harass the
opposition and rig the vote.
The EU sanctions include a ban on travel to Europe and a freeze on
assets here of 20 Zimbabwean officials, including the president.
They were voted when the EU's chief election observer in Harare, Pierre
Shori of Sweden, was expelled from the country, after which the entire
EU observer team withdrew.
In Harare, Mugabe's government was said to be preparing its response to
the Commonwealth action, which a government minister scorned.
"We will not spend sleepless nights about the Commonwealth,"
Information Minister Jonathan Moyo said.
