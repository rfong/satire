Donors And Haitians Agree To Speed Up Aid
International donors and Haitian officials agreed Friday to get
promised aid flowing faster to the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation.
``I'm a little bit more optimistic. The highest levels have given their
subordinates orders to get a move on,'' Premier Smarck Michel told The
Associated Press at the conclusion of the two-day meeting.
Seven months after a U.S-led multinational intervention put an end to
three devastating years of military rule and international sanctions,
Haiti is still in ruins.
Many Haitians, facing rising prices and 70 percent unemployment,
complain that international promises to rebuild their shattered economy
have not been kept.
A group of international donors pledged dlrs 1.2 billion to Haiti in
January. Since then about dlrs 240 million has been disbursed, but
little has gone to development. About dlrs 300 million more will be
disbursed by the end of this year, U.S. Ambassador William Swing told
the AP.
At the meeting, donors responded to Michel's request to consider the
urgency of Haiti's plight and simplify procedures for disbursing aid.
``We can all look at ways to accelerate our own internal procedures,''
said Marc Schneider of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
``You're going to see the first project disbursements very soon.''
The World Bank could get projects under way in six to nine months, half
the usual time, said Shahid Javed Burki, its vice president for Latin
America and the Caribbean.
