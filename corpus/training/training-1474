UN agency tackles cattle disease in northern Iraq 
A UN agency has just completed the largest ever campaign to combat
cattle disease in northern Iraq by vaccinating 27,000 cows, Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) officials said Thursday.
Cases of rinderpest, a highly contagious cattle disease, have increased
in recent years in Iraq and Iran partly because it is impossible to
control the semi-nomads crossing between the countries with their
herds, said FAO agronomist Farydun Maaruf.
The 1991 Gulf war also made it hard to find vaccines and the infection
rate rose dramatically, he added.
Four teams of three to four people each vaccinated the cattle in the
last few weeks, overcoming the difficulties posed by factional fighting
among Kurdish groups controlling the area.
Following the success of the programme the FAO is planning a similar
but larger campaign in Iran.
Vaccines will also be given to the veterinary department in northern
Iraq "in order that they can react whenever it is necessary and follow
up the vaccinations regularly," Maaruf said.
