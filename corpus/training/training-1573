France Calls for Ceasefire Treaty in Colombia 
France welcomes the signs of resumption of peace talks between the
Colombian government and the country's largest rebel armed forces FARC
and calls on the parties concerned to conclude a ceasefire treaty as
rapidly as possible, the French Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
"France calls on all parties to pursue the way of dialogue and to reach
a ceasefire treaty rapidly," said a ministry statement.
Colombia's government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC) last Friday invited 10 countries (Canada, Cuba, Spain, France,
Italy, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Venezuela) to form a
committee to assist the country's two-year- old peace talks.
Earlier on Thursday, diplomats from 26 countries, the United Nations
and the European Union visited negotiators of the two sides in the
FARC-controlled area in south Colombia to show support for peace.
Paris has already participated in the group of nations that are friends
and facilitators of the peace process between the Colombian government
and the ELN (the country's second largest rebel armed forces, the
French ministerial document added.
The FARC has been fighting government troops for 37 years and had
always resisted foreign assistance in peace talks.
About 35,000 civilians have been killed in the last 10 years of
conflict.
