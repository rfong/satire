Turkish President Approves New Political Parties Law 
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel Friday approved a constitutional
change in the Political Parties Law, the presidential press center said
here Friday.
The proposal for the amendment in the Political Parties Law was adopted
by the Parliament on Thursday.
Under the new law, a banned political party cannot be established again
under another name.
Any member or founder of a political party whose words and actions led
to the closure of a party cannot act as member, founder, administrator
or a controller of another political party for five years.
In accordance with the new law, any person who is 18 years old and who
is entitled to civil and political rights, can become a member of a
political party.
Political parties in Turkey cannot receive aid, get instructions and
act on decisions from foreign countries, international institutions and
some real and legal bodies which are not of Turkish nationality and
oppose the independence and territorial integrity of Turkey, said the
new law.
