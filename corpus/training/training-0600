Nepal's National Airline Slashes Flights to India 
Nepal's national flag carrier, the Royal Nepal Airlines, has decided to
slash down the number of its flights to various destinations in India
from today due to a shortage of aircraft, newspapers said here today.
The airline's twice daily flights between Kathmandu and Delhi are
affected hardest by the cancellation move with all the flights on
September 17, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27 and 29 being canceled, the reports
said.
Scheduled flights to Calcutta and Mumbai from September 17 to 28 are
also withdrawn partially, they added.
Meanwhile, the Royal Nepal's weekly flights to Paris have also been
affected by the cancellation, according to airline officials.
It was reported that the move to cancel scheduled flights came after
the airline decided not to reextend the lease on a foreign Boeing 727
jet which it had operated with on its India routes since early June.
The lease on the Yugoslav jet expired today, leaving the Royal Nepal
with only two wide-body Boeing 757 to operate in its international
section as no new deals on leased foreign aircraft are in place.
