Two regional leaders head race for job of Indian 
Two top regional leaders were emerging here Monday as leading
candidates for the prime minister's post after H.D. Deve Gowda's fall,
party officials said.
A senior official in the United Front alliance said G.K. Moopanar, the
leader of the regional Tamil Manila Congress (TMC) party, and N.
Chandrababu Naidu were tipped to become prime minister of a new
coalition government.
"It is a leader from south India who will be elected as the consensus
candidate. Both Moopanar and Naidu are on the top of our list," he
said.
He said either of them would be acceptable to the Congress (I) party,
which helped vote the minority Front coalition out of office Friday
after arguing Deve Gowda should be sacked as prime minister.
Congress, however, has pledged to renew its backing and help reinstate
a new Front coalition if it chooses a new leader.
Moopanar set up the TMC last year after leaving the Congress party. He
has never held a government post.
Naidu, chief minister of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is
leader of the regional Telugu Desam party.
