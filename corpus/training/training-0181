Israeli Army Destroys Palestinian Position in Gaza Strip 
The Israeli army on Wednesday destroyed a position of the Palestinian
security force in the southern Gaza Strip.
The position in Rafah on border with Egypt was smashed after the
Israeli army exchanged fires with the Palestinian security force,
during which one Palestinian security man and an Israeli soldier were
wounded.
Before the fire exchanges, Jewish settlers nearby held protest at the
deterioration of the situation and fired at the Palestinian security
force, leaving a Palestinian injured.
The Palestinian force counterattacked the settlers, a move which
sparked the Israeli army's actions.
Meanwhile, an Israeli special unit captured several members of the
Palestinian mainstream Fatah movement.
