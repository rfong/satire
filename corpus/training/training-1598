GRIFF'S STATS STUNTED, BUT FAMILY TIME IS `NICE' 
And Fred McGriff thought playing in 162 games every season was tough.
``One day we're going to Chuck E Cheese, then the Discovery Zone, then
hitting the ball in the backyard,'' the Braves first baseman said of
his baseball-free days with 31/2-year-old son Eric.
``I have to wear him out just so I can get out on the golf course.''
So McGriff is back at home in Tampa, palling around with Eric and
hitting the little white ball. He even admits in a round-about way that
he doesn't really miss the game, adding, ``If I say that, people will
get the impression I really don't care.
``But what they don't realize is that this is the first time I have
gotten to spend with my family like this. When we were playing, I had
to leave at 3 in the afternoon every day and Eric didn't understand
that. Now I see him when he gets up and when he goes down. It's nice.''
And this comes from a player on the verge of a career season, with 34
home runs and 94 RBIs through 114 games. McGriff said he doesn't really
think about what could have been, however.
``I could be selfish and say, `Let's go back out there,' '' he said.
``But I can't be selfish. I have to think about the other people, the
ones before me that sacrificed. We'll start playing again when the
owners give up the salary cap. We've seen what the salary cap has done
in football. Talk to Stan (Kasten). The ball is in their court.''
McGriff, like many players, is ready to wait it out, even if it goes
well into next season. Does he miss the paycheck, a cool $20,718 a day,
which has added up to $393,642?
``It's just one of those things,'' he said. ``We had been paid for
two-thirds of the season. We'll survive. We have to look long-range. I
don't think anybody is hurting.''
McGriff said the only teammate he has talked to is Mark Lemke, who is
his best friend on the club. And other than golf and some tossing with
Eric in the backyard, he said he has done no conditioning work.
``It would take me three or four days to get back into it,'' he said.
``Hitting is all mechanical, so it is really no big deal. But something
is going to happen, something quick to save it. September is going to
be a big.
``I think everybody wants to come back and play. But I can't say that I
haven't enjoyed the two or so weeks I have had off. It sure does
something for your aches and pains.''
So does Eric. .
