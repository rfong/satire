``/`` You/PRP sure/RB do/VBP n't/RB find/VB stuff/NN like/IN that/DT back/NN in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ''/'' Albright/NNP and/CC Ahern/NNP also/RB discussed/VBD trade/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD nations/NNS ./.

Though/IN many/JJ U.S./NNP economists/NNS regard/VBP the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP as/IN a/DT potential/JJ threat/NN to/TO American/JJ prosperity/NN ,/, and/CC concern/NN has/VBZ been/VBN voiced/VBN over/IN restrictions/NNS Ireland/NNP has/VBZ placed/VBN on/IN certain/JJ imports/NNS ,/, Albright/NNP stressed/VBD that/IN the/DT Republic/NNP continues/VBZ to/TO be/VB an/DT excellent/JJ target/NN for/IN U.S./NNP investment/JJ and/CC consumer/NN dollars/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PRP bought/VBD this/DT gorgeous/JJ handmade/JJ Aran/NN fisherman/NN 's/POS sweater/NN at/IN Blarney/NNP Woolen/NNP Mills/NNP in/IN Kilkenny/NNP for/IN a/DT fraction/NN of/IN what/WP I/PRP would/MD 've/VB paid/VBN back/RP in/IN the/DT States/NNPS ,/, ''/'' Albright/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` If/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO save/VB some/DT serious/JJ coin/NN ,/, people/NNS ,/, shop/VB for/IN Irish/JJ stuff/NN in/IN Ireland/NNP ./. ''/''

Albright/NNP also/RB spent/VBD half/PDT a/DT day/NN meeting/NN with/IN Protestant/JJ and/CC Catholic/JJ leaders/NNS in/IN Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP ./.

After/IN laying/VBG a/DT commemorative/JJ wreath/NN in/IN the/DT town/NN square/NN of/IN Omagh/NNP --/: site/NN of/IN the/DT IRA/NNP bomb/NN attack/NN that/WDT killed/VBD 29/CD people/NNS last/JJ summer/NN --/: the/DT Secretary/NNP of/IN State/NNP drove/NNP a/DT rented/NN Mini/NNP to/TO the/DT famed/JJ Giants/NNPS '/POS Causeway/NNP ,/, a/DT long/JJ shoreline/NN of/IN perfectly/RB symmetrical/JJ ,/, hexagonal/JJ volcanic/JJ rocks/NNS she/PRP said/VBD ``/`` weirded/VBD me/PRP out/RP completely/RB ./.

The/DT visit/NN to/TO the/DT Causeway/NNP was/VBD nearly/RB ruined/VBN by/IN an/DT unexpected/JJ crisis/NN ,/, but/CC Albright/NNP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO broker/VB an/DT 11th-hour/JJ deal/NN to/TO save/VB the/DT situation/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP really/RB wanted/VBD a/DT picture/NN of/IN me/PRP at/IN the/DT Causeway/NNP ,/, but/CC stupid/RB me/PRP left/VBD the/DT camera/NN at/IN the/DT hotel/NN ./.

Albright/NNP concluded/VBD her/PRP$ visit/NN with/IN an/DT address/NN before/IN the/DT Oireachtas/NNPS ,/, the/DT Irish/JJ parliament/NN ./.

``/`` Then/RB ,/, at/IN like/IN 4/CD o'clock/RB ,/, we/PRP started/VBD getting/VBG hungry/JJ and/CC we/PRP were/VBD kind/NN of/IN tired/JJ from/IN all/PDT the/DT walking/NN ,/, so/IN we/PRP stopped/VBD at/IN this/DT caf/NN near/IN Trinity/NNP College/NNP ,/, where/WRB we/PRP met/VBD these/DT two/CD guys/NNS from/IN Australia/NNP ,/, John/NNP and/CC Tony/NNP ,/, who/WP go/VBP to/TO the/DT University/NNP of/IN Melbourne/NNP ./.
