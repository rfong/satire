Chinese vice premier meets with Castro, signs investment deals 
China's Vice Premier Li Lanqing concluded tourism and agriculture
investment accords with Cuban officials during a visit here due to wrap
up Tuesday, the Cuban Communist Party paper Granma said.
Li told Granma he had a positive meeting with President Fidel Castro,
which followed discussions Sunday with Vice President Carlos Lage, the
architect of Cuba's limited market economic reforms, and Foreign Trade
Minister Ricardo Cabrisas, the report said.
Lage and Li presided over the signing of China's first investment deals
in the booming Cuban tourism industry, construction of a motel in
Varadero. China will be partners in the deal with Gaviota, the tourism
holding company affiliated with the Cuban armed forces.
In addition, officials signed a letter of intent to set up a
rice-producing joint venture on 5,000 hectares.
Li also attended a bilateral business convention Sunday and toured
Chinatown in the capital, just weeks ahead of Cuba's 150th anniversary
celebration of the Chinese presence in this Caribbean country.
He is set to leave Cuba Tuesday to continue a Latin American tour
including stops in Colombia, Chile and Argentina.
Li's visit came on the heels of one by Chinese Communist Party
politburo member Huang Ju, who concluded a Cuban stay Sunday that
included two meetings with Castro and talks on closer bilateral
economic ties.
