Investment in Zimbabwe Drops Sharply 
Foreign and local investment in Zimbabwe dropped drastically from
January to May this year compared with the same period in 1999,
according to statistics released Monday by the Zimbabwe Investment
Center (ZIC).
The ZIC approved a total of 76 new projects during the period under
review, which were worth 39.4 million U.S. dollars, shrinking 80
percent from the corresponding period last year.
Among the new projects, 11 are foreign owned, which accounted for 30.6
percent of the total, while 65 are joint ventures, which constituted
69.4 percent.
The new projects are mainly involved in manufacturing, mining,
agriculture, tourism, construction, commercial and transport sectors.
The approved projects would be implemented by investors from Austria,
China, France, India, Lebanon, Pakistan, South Africa, the United
Kingdom and the United States among other countries.
Analysts said the difficult macro-economic environment characterized by
high inflation and high interest rates scared away investors.
