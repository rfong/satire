Kenyan Economy to Recover Mildly in 1999 
The Central Bank of Kenya has predicted that the Kenyan economy would
achieve a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2.5 percent in 1999, a
mild recovery compared to the 1.6 percent in 1998.
However, the central bank said this will depend on improvement in the
country's infrastructure, especially the dilapidated road network,
security and increased efficiency of public services.
The bank's Monthly Economic Review for April said the 12 month to
January 1999 showed an expanded GDP of 1.7 percent.
This expanded growth has been achieved from improved agricultural
production that has benefited from good weather conditions in the past
six months compared to early 1998 when the El Nino rains destroyed
crops, the East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
Statistics from the bank indicate that the agricultural sector recorded
a 1.7 percent growth from the end of last year to early this year
compared to 1.2 percent achieved in the same period last year, mainly
owing to good weather conditions.
The bank also noted that the manufacturing sector and tourism industry
experienced no much progress in the past 12 months.
The International Monetary Fund Tuesday predicted in a report that
Kenya is highly likely to achieve a 3.5 percent growth rate in 1999.
