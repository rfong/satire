Anelka decision time for France 
Roger Lemerre is facing decision time for inconsistent striker Nicolas
Anelka ahead of his squad announcement on Thursday for the World Cup
warm-up match against Russia next week.
He has snubbed the much-travelled striker since September 2001, but has
been careful to leave the door open for his eventual reinsertion to his
group of players.
"Anelka took a wise decision in moving to Liverpool," Lemerre said
recently. "He must be given time to settle down."
Anelka's appearances in England have been fleeting, but he has shown
some promise and has received praise from coach Gerard Houllier and his
deupty Phil Thompson.
But with Russia, being France's penultimate warm-up match before they
travel to defend their title in South Korea, time is running out for
the former Paris St Germain, Arsenal and Real Madrid player.
Lemerre is ever faithful to the core of players that won the World and
European titles for France and his strike force options are the envy of
other world powers.
Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet, Sylvain Wiltord and Steve Marlet proved
in the 5-0 drubbing of Scotland in France's last match that Lemerre has
strength in depth in the goal-scoring stakes.
Anelka could be surplus to requirements.
Defenders Lilian Thuram of Juventus and Willy Sagnol of Bayern Munich
are expected to be brought back after missing the Scotland game through
injury, but forward Christophe Dugarry will once again be unavailable.
