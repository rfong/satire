Iraq putting on show to pressure UN: Israeli military sources 
Iraq is aiming to pressure the United Nations into easing its sanctions
by moving troops toward the Kuwaiti border, Israeli military sources
said Friday.
The troop movements reported by US officials in Washington are "only
for show" ahead of a meeting on Monday of the UN Security Council to
discuss the sanctions and long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons, they
said.
The sources said Israel itself did not feel threatened.
During the 1991 Gulf War, two people died when Iraq launched 39 Scud
missiles on Israel. Hundreds of houses in Tel Aviv and the northern
town of Haifa were damaged in the attacks.
The crippling UN sanctions were slapped on Iraq in August 1990 when it
invaded Kuwait. It was driven out in February 1991 by a US-led
coalition.
