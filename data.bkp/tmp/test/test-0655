Adams/NNP says/VBZ IRA/NNP warning/NN casts/VBZ no/DT doubts/NNS on/IN peace/NN process/NN The/DT Irish/JJ Republican/NNP Army/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- IRA/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- said/VBD Friday/NNP it/PRP would/MD not/RB surrender/VB its/PRP$ arms/NNS before/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN all-party/JJ peace/NN talks/NNS on/IN Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP ,/, drawing/VBG swift/JJ rebuke/NN from/IN London/NNP and/CC pro-British/JJ parties/NNS in/IN the/DT province/NN ./.

In/IN a/DT statement/NN early/JJ Friday/NNP ,/, the/DT IRA/NNP said/VBD there/EX was/VBD ``/`` no/DT question/NN ''/'' that/IN it/PRP would/MD meet/VB the/DT British/JJ government/NN 's/POS ``/`` ludicrous/JJ demand/NN for/IN a/DT surrender/NN of/IN IRA/NNP weapons/NNS ''/'' before/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN all-party/JJ talks/NNS ./.

Gerry/NNP Adams/NNP ,/, leader/NN of/IN the/DT IRA/NNP 's/POS political/JJ wing/NNP Sinn/NNP Fein/NNP ,/, moved/VBD quickly/RB to/TO dispel/VB fears/NNS that/IN the/DT statement/NN cast/NN doubts/VBZ on/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN ,/, given/VBN a/DT new/JJ lease/NN on/IN life/NN last/JJ week/NN by/IN a/DT peace/NN formula/NN put/VBN forward/RB by/IN prime/JJ ministers/NNS John/NNP Major/NNP of/IN Britain/NNP and/CC John/NNP Bruton/NNP of/IN Ireland/NNP ./.

Major/NNP lashed/VBD out/RP at/IN the/DT IRA/NNP position/NN ,/, saying/VBG it/PRP pointedly/RB ignored/VBD the/DT Irish/JJ people/NNS 's/POS desire/NN for/IN peace/NN ./.

``/`` IRA/NNP intransigence/NN is/VBZ a/DT slap/NN in/IN the/DT face/NN to/TO the/DT hundreds/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN people/NNS in/IN Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP and/CC the/DT -LRB-/-LRB- Irish/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- republic/NN who/WP last/JJ week/NN demonstrated/VBD their/PRP$ massive/JJ desire/NN for/IN peace/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, referring/VBG to/TO the/DT effusive/JJ reaction/NN to/TO a/DT visit/NN by/IN US/NNP President/NNP Bill/NNP Clinton/NNP ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ now/RB up/RB to/TO Gerry/NNP Adams/NNP to/TO make/VB this/DT message/NN penetrate/VB all/DT corners/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ movement/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, adding/VBG that/IN the/DT IRA/NNP should/MD heed/VB the/DT message/NN of/IN the/DT people/NNS to/TO put/VB down/RP their/PRP$ guns/NNS ./.

The/DT question/NN of/IN IRA/NNP disarmament/NN has/VBZ deadlocked/VBN the/DT peace/NN process/NN for/IN months/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT paramilitary/JJ group/NN refusing/VBG to/TO hand/VB over/RP weapons/NNS ,/, as/IN demanded/VBD by/IN London/NNP ,/, until/IN all-party/JJ talks/NNS on/IN Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP 's/POS future/NN begin/VBP ./.

Last/JJ Tuesday/NNP ,/, Major/NNP and/CC Bruton/NNP announced/VBD a/DT ``/`` twin-track/JJ ''/'' approach/NN ,/, with/IN an/DT international/JJ commission/NN overseeing/VBG disarmament/NN during/IN preliminary/JJ talks/NNS ,/, in/IN a/DT move/NN which/WDT appeared/VBD to/TO breathe/VB new/JJ life/NN into/IN the/DT stalled/VBN process/NN ./.

The/DT IRA/NNP 's/POS announcement/NN was/VBD ,/, however/RB ,/, read/VB as/IN a/DT sign/NN that/IN the/DT organization/NN had/VBD ruled/VBN out/IN cooperating/VBG with/IN the/DT commission/NN ./.

Hours/NNS after/IN the/DT IRA/NNP statement/NN ,/, Adams/NNP said/VBD there/EX were/VBD ``/`` no/DT fresh/JJ doubts/NNS ''/'' on/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN ./.

``/`` Doubts/NNS arise/VBP from/IN the/DT British/JJ government/NN 's/POS refusal/NN to/TO engage/VB positively/RB into/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN .../: its/PRP$ repeated/VBN bad/JJ faith/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Adams/NNP ./.

``/`` We/PRP have/VBP had/VBN and/CC we/PRP will/MD continue/VB to/TO have/VB a/DT positive/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT twin-track/JJ process/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` The/DT issue/NN of/IN disarmament/NN is/VBZ both/DT achievable/JJ and/CC necessary/JJ but/CC without/IN dialogue/NN nothing/NN is/VBZ possible/JJ ./. ''/''

The/DT IRA/NNP statement/NN said/VBD British/NNP ``/`` bad/JJ faith/NN ''/'' and/CC Unionist/NNP ``/`` intransigence/NN ''/'' had/VBD raised/VBN a/DT question/NN mark/NN over/IN the/DT future/NN of/IN the/DT twin-track/JJ approach/NN ,/, and/CC demand/NN for/IN a/DT surrender/NN of/IN weapons/NNS was/VBD blocking/VBG dialogue/NN which/WDT was/VBD ``/`` essential/JJ if/IN the/DT causes/NNS of/IN conflict/NN are/VBP to/TO be/VB removed/VBN ./.

Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP Secretary/NNP Patrick/NNP Mayhew/NNP ,/, meeting/NN with/IN Irish/JJ Foreign/NNP Secretary/NNP Dick/NNP Spring/NNP in/IN London/NNP ,/, called/VBD the/DT statement/NN ``/`` very/RB unhelpful/JJ ,/, but/CC a/DT restatement/NN of/IN a/DT position/NN with/IN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP familiar/JJ ./.

The/DT IRA/NNP statement/NN came/VBD hours/NNS after/IN it/PRP was/VBD confirmed/VBN that/IN the/DT international/JJ commission/NN ,/, headed/VBN by/IN former/JJ US/NNP senator/NN George/NNP Mitchell/NNP ,/, was/VBD to/TO hold/VB its/PRP$ first/JJ meeting/NN in/IN New/NNP York/NNP at/IN the/DT weekend/NN ,/, with/IN subsequent/JJ sessions/NNS in/IN Belfast/NNP and/CC Dublin/NNP next/JJ week/NN ./.

Meanwhile/RB the/DT White/NNP House/NNP dismissed/VBD concerns/NNS that/IN the/DT IRA/NNP refusal/NN to/TO turn/VB over/RP its/PRP$ weapons/NNS indicated/VBD a/DT breakdown/NN in/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN ./.

``/`` We/PRP are/VBP hopeful/JJ ,/, based/VBN on/IN our/PRP$ conversations/NNS with/IN Gerry/NNP Adams/NNP that/IN Sinn/NNP Fein/NNP sees/VBZ the/DT merits/NNS of/IN the/DT twin-track/JJ process/NN ,/, ''/'' White/NNP House/NNP spokesman/NN Michael/NNP McCurry/NNP said/VBD ./.
