Stoltenberg, who ousted New Zealand's Brett Steven 7-6 (7/5), 4-6, 6-3,
was raised on a cotton farm in New South Wales and first played on a
white dirt court there.
Stoltenberg survived two third-set rain delays lasting a total of 123
minutes. Stoltenberg led 2-1 on serve when rain began and dominated
when play resumed, breaking Steven in the first game back. Rain stopped
them again, but Stoltenberg won after only seven points once play
resumed.
"The first rain delay worked in my favor," Stoltenberg said. "Brett
might have felt a bit on top. The match was tilting his way. After the
rain, I came out aggressive and got a break straight away."
Stoltenberg had played in five straight ATP events before taking a rest
last week. The holiday paid off.
"I didn't expect too much here. My preparation wasn't ideal," he said.
"I was pretty drained. I felt like I had a lot of tennis. I went to
Orlando and took a week off. It helped me freshen up mentally."
Stoltenberg faces Wheaton next. Both are nine-year veterans who won
their second career titles earlier this year. Stoltenberg's came at the
US Clay finals in April. Wheaton won two weeks ago at Newport. They
have split six career meetings, with Stoltenberg winning all three on
hardcourts, the surface used here.
"We have always played close matches," Stoltenberg said. "Neither has a
great advantage."
Wheaton served well in eliminating Australia's Michael Tebbutt 7-5,
6-4. Tebbutt, who departed quickly for a friend's weekend wedding in
Arizona, had 14 aces but could not break Wheaton.
"In both sets, he played one bad game on his serve," Wheaton said. "He
has a big serve. He just double faulted and made unforced errors each
time and I had consistent sets."
"I played a couple of loose games and it cost me," Tebbutt said. "I
just lost my concentration. I needed to be more aggressive on his
second serves."
