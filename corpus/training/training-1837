Betts suspended for two matches 
British Test forward Dennis Betts was suspended for two matches on
Tuesday by an Australian Rugby League judiciary after his dismissal
last Thursday.
Betts was sent off by ARL referee Eddie Ward during the Auckland
Warriors' 22-8 loss to Western Suburbs on a headbutting charge.
Betts, in his second season with John Monie's Warriors, maintained he
struck West's hooker Cherry Mescia while in the process of getting into
position for a quick play on the ball, but pleaded guilty to carelessly
striking Mescia.
Twenty six-year-old Betts, who has played 29 Tests and 286 games for
champion English club Wigan, whom Monie used to coach, had never been
sent off before.
Betts told the tribunal he was embarrassed to be the first Warriors'
player to be sent off since the club joined the premiership last year.
"It was a careless act. After I was sent off I felt like I had cost my
side the match and as it turned out I probably did just that," the
second rower said.
