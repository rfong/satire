Massive strikes escalate in SKorea, stock market slides 
More than one million workers were set to walk off the job Friday as
strike fever escalated over the revision of labor laws, sending stock
prices skidding for the second straight day.
The market tumbled 2.2 percent in early trading as workers went on
strike at eight major hospitals in Seoul and its satellite cities, with
four more scheduled to follow in the afternoon.
"Our 1.2 million unionists at 5,500 worksites nationwide will leave
their jobs at 1:00 p.m," (0400 GMT) said a spokesman of the Federation
of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), the country's biggest umbrella union.
The first strike would last 23 hours, and the timetable for the
following protest measures would be further discussed, the spokesman
said.
The government, police and prosecutors have warned that harsh action
will be taken against the "illegal" strikers.
On Thursday, the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) unilaterally passed the
labor bill along with another bill increasing the powers of the secret
police in the absence of the opposition MPs.
The dramatic pre-dawn passage of the bill stoked immediate labor fury,
with strike calls and street protests across the country.
Some 150,000 workers abandoned their jobs nationwide on Thursday, with
the union of the giant Hyundai Business Group entering an indefinite
strike and other key industries hit hard by labor disputes, according
to the smaller bur more militant Korean Confederation of Trade Unions
(KCTU).
The outlawed KCTU, which claims a membership of 300,000 workers, said
Friday participants in the general strike would double by Saturday, as
unionists at hospitals and the Seoul subway joined.
Subway workers have said they will go out Saturday, and television
broadcasters Monday.
South Korean unionists blast the new law as favoring management and
exploiting labor, by making it easier to lay off workers, to increase
working hours, to substitute striking workers with part-time workers.
But the government said the revision was necessary to confirm South
Korean labor law to international norms following its entry into the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develpoment (OECD).
The new law also allows multiple trade unions and third party
intervention, both banned under the previous law.
