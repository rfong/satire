Indonesia to Repeat Voting at 111 Polling Stations 
In an unprecedented move, the Indonesian government has acquiesced to a
party's demand for a repeat of voting at 111 polling stations on Madura
Island, East Java.
General Elections Institute Secretary-General Suryatna Subrata said
here Saturday that the voting on May 29 in the area was disrupted due
to a "security disturbance," institute officials said today.
Suryatna did not admit it but his statement was an indirect denial of
previous reports that residents of Sampang and Pamekasan regencies were
so outraged by what they called blatant poll rigging that they rioted,
causing a great deal of destruction, before demanding fresh polling.
According to local reports, riots have broken out in several East Java
cities after preliminary election results gave the ruling Golkar group
an overwhelming lead.
After the riots, the United Development Party (PPP) demanded a repeat
of the voting.
The repeat balloting will be held on June 3 in 86 sites in Sampang and
another 35 in Pamekasan at the request of their respective district
election committee chiefs.
It will be the first repeat voting ever under President Soeharto's New
Order government, which held its first election in 1971.
Suryatna reiterated that vote-rigging allegations lodged by PPP
supporters were behind the decision to repeat the balloting.
According to provisional vote counting results announced last night,
the Golkar has won 74 percent of the vote, the PPP 23 percent and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) 3 percent.
The three parties are vying for 425 seats in the 500-member House of
Representatives. The remaining 75 seats are reserved for the Armed
Forces whose members do not vote.
A total of 124,740,987 people were eligible to vote in the May 29
general election, the sixth in the country since 1971.
