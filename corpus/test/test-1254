Australia Lead Switzerland 2-0 in Fed Cup 
Nicole Pratt and Alicia Molik beat their rivals respectively in the
singles to help Australia take a 2-0 lead over Switzerland on the
opening day of their Fed Cup second round tie on Saturday.
Pratt beat 16-year-old Myriam Casanova 6-3 6-1 in less than an hour on
the grass surface at The Royal Sydney Golf Club.
Molik then rolled over Myriam's 17-year-old sister Daniela by the same
scoreline.
Switzerland's top players, including world number one Martina Hingis,
were unavailable for the tie.
Switzerland will attempt to keep the tie alive in the reverse singles
