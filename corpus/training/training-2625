Lithuania privatises last state-owned bank 
The Lithuanian State Property Fund announced Monday an agreement with
German bank Nord/LB to privatise state-owned Zemes Ukio Bankas, the
last privatisation of a public bank.
Under the agreement, Nord/LB will pay 71 million litas (20.58 million
euros, 18 million dollars) for a 76.01-percent stake in Zemes Ukio
Bankas, as well invest 65 million litas, the Fund said in a statement.
"Despite strong competition in financial markets in central and eastern
Europe, where many banks are on sale and despite the fact that Zemes
Ukio Bankas is privatised for the third time, we managed to attract a
strong European market player to Lithuania," Fund chief Povilas
Milasauskas was quoted as saying.
Jurgen Kosters, a board member of Nord/LB, said that the bank sees
Lithuania as an interesting and promising market.
"Nord/LB investment in Zemes Ukio Bankas is the largest bank investment
in the Baltic states," Kosters said.
Zemes Ukio Bankas is the third-largest Lithuanian bank, holding about
16 percent of the deposit market and about 12.5 percent of the loan
market.
In 2001 the bank's unaudited profit grew by 16.4 percent to 2.45
million euros.
