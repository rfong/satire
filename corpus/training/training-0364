Simpson prosecutor's husband seeks custody of young sons: report 
Prosecutor Marcia Clark's estranged husband has asked a court for
primary custody of their two young sons, alleging she spends most of
her time on the O.J. Simpson murder trial, the Los Angeles Times said
Thursday.
"I have personal knowledge that on most nights she does not arrive home
until 10 p.m. and even when she is home, she is working," Gordon Clark
said in court documents filed February 24.
Their boys, ages 3 and 5, spend two evenings a week with their father
and every other weekend.
"While I commend Marcia Clark's brilliance, her legal ability and her
tremendous competence as an attorney, I do not want our children to
continue to suffer because she is never home, and never has any time to
spend with them," he said.
The Los Angeles prosecutor filed for divorce June 9, three days before
the double murder Simpson is charged with committing.
