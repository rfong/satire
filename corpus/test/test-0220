Spielberg plans draw fire from environmentalists 
Director Steven Spielberg's plans for a new Hollywood studio on what is
now a swamp along the Pacific coast is drawing fire from
environmentalists.
One environmental leader, Jerry Rubin of the Alliance for Survival,
went on a hunger strike Friday in an effort to block the plans by
Spielberg and his partners in the DreamWorks studios.
"Roses are red, violets are blue, not building on wetlands is what
DreamWorks should do," said one of the signs by opponents of the
project.
The company created by Spielberg, former Walt Disney executive Jeffrey
Katzenberg and investor David Geffen plans to build the first new
studio in the area in half a century.
But it has not been easy for the director of "Jurassic Park" and
"Raiders of the Lost Ark."
The project, which is linked with an eight billion dollar real estate
project called Playa Vista, drew demonstrations last year, with some
opponents chaining themselves to bulldozers.
"We don't want to see Steven Spielberg become the 'raider of the last
park,'" said environmental activist Bruce Robertson.
But the critics lost a court battle last year, arguing in vain that the
plan would destroy rare habitat, historic buildings and an Indian
burial site.
The site is part of 400 hectare (1,000 acres) near Los Angeles
International Airport that includes the hangar where Howard Hughes
built his giant airplane, the "Spruce Goose."
