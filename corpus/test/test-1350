Sao Tome's entire air fleet (one plane) crashes 
The entire air fleet of the tiny twin-island state of Sao Tome and
Principe was wiped out Saturday when the single plane owned by the Air
Sao Tome e Principe airline crash-landed because of bad weather.
The company said the 12 passengers and three crew members only suffered
minor contusions in the accident, caused when the ageing two-propellor
De Havilland aircraft slipped off the runway after an emergency
landing.
Apparently unsalvageable, the loss of the plane poses a problem for the
130,000 residents on the two islands off the west African coast and
separated by 200 kilometres (120 miles) of Atlantic waters.
