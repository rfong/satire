Elizabeth Peterken McCaughey, who prefers to be called Betsy, was born
with her twin brother William in Pittsburgh on Oct. 10, 1948. Her
father, Albert Peterken, a maintenance man in a fingernail-clipper
factory, moved his wife, Ramona, and their children around the
Northeast before settling in Westport, Conn., when Elizabeth was 6.
In 11th grade, she won a scholarship to Mary Burnham School for Girls
in Northampton, Mass., and then another scholarship to Vassar College.
There, she said, she largely ignored protests against the Vietnam War,
instead spending her time reading in the school library. She was the
first member of her family to graduate from college.
She earned a master's degree from Vassar in 1972, then moved to New
York City with her husband, Thomas K. McCaughey, a Yale student whom
she met at college. They separated in 1992 and were divorced early last
year. They have three daughters, Amanda, 15; Caroline, 13, and Diana,
10, who live with their mother. Last month, she announced her
engagement to Wilbur L. Ross Jr., an investment banker who was also a
fund-raiser for Gov. Mario Cuomo.
In 1976, Ms. McCaughey earned a doctorate in constitutional history
from Columbia and has taught there and at Vassar. Until a few years
ago, she was registered to vote as an independent.
``I always assumed her to be a middle-of-the road Democrat,'' said
Henry Graff, the presidential studies expert who taught her at
Columbia.
Ms. McCaughey began to be noticed in political circles last February
after her articles on the Clinton health care plan struck a chord,
provoking a White House response.
A few weeks before the Republican State Convention in May, Pataki, who
had read her articles at the prodding of CBS chairman Laurence Tisch,
met with her for the first time, though she says he did not recruit her
as a running mate until the night before she was designated by the
convention.
She attacked her task of Medicaid cost-cutting with what has become a
familiar pattern: collecting and digesting scores of documents from
which she spits out factoids at random (and at times uses to head off
pointed questions).
This was how she tackled the Clinton health care plan. This was also
the way, as she tells the story, that she rose from her working-class
roots. Study, she once said, ``was my one big chance in life.''
But some of her critics, and even a few friends, see in her devotion to
the academic a distance from the real world of politics and policy.
For example, critics of her health care articles, which argued that the
Clinton health care bill would limit choices for medical care, say she
deftly dissected the bill's language but showed little understanding of
how that language would translate into real programs.
``It was the kind of reasoning if you could find a loophole you wrote
half a page about it and ignored the context,'' said John Rother, the
legislative director for the American Association of Retired People,
which supported health care reform but did not endorse the Clinton
plan.
But John R. Zagame, the executive director of the New York Association
of Counties, which has lobbied for lightening the cost of Medicaid on
localities, said Ms. McCaughey has to her advantage that ``she has not
been tainted by the cynicism and sense of helplessness people in Albany
have about Medicaid -- that you cannot change it.''
``She brings a sense of urgency to the issue,'' Zagame said.
For Ms. McCaughey's part, her urgency about Medicaid flows over every
detail-laden sentence she speaks. ``It is the most interesting
intellectual problem,'' she said. ``It is the intersection of
economics, ethics, science, medicine, public policy and politics.''
Already, she has begun the transition from scholar to politician.
``Academics are soloists,'' she said during the campaign, ``and
successful candidates are team players.''
