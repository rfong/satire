NGO to Raise Funds for HIV/AIDS Prevention in Southern Africa 
A non-governmental organization, World Vision International, is to
launch a bicycle tour in Southern Africa next month as part of the
organization's strategy to raise funds for HIV/AIDS prevention programs
in the region, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Monday.
Zimbabwean Communications Officer of World Vision International Vongai
Makamure was quoted as saying that the tour is also aimed at raising
awareness against the killer disease.
It is expected to build a network of new partners and supporters in the
battle against ignorance about HIV/AIDS through the activity, Makamure
said.
The bicycle tour will start on May 16 from Mangochi, on the shores of
Lake Malawi, to Durban, South Africa, via Zambia, Zimbabwe, Swaziland
and Mozambique.
Countries involved in the activity were expected to provide an average
of 15 cyclists for the tour, which is expected to end on June 9.
"In the last decade alone, the incidence of HIV/AIDS has increased 30
times in Africa and we have to take a bold stand against this ticking
time bomb," Makamure said.
According to World Health Organization statistics, one in every five
deaths on the African continent is believed to be AIDS related and at
least 23 million Africans are now HIV-infected.
