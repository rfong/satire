German bank to help MobilCom if France Telecom pulls out: report 
The German regional public bank Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein (LB Kiel)
could step in as a temporary partner for telephone operator MobilCom if
France Telecom decides to sell its stake in the German firm, the
business daily Handelsblatt reported on Friday.
That is part of an emergency plan drawn up by the regional government
of the state of Schleswig Holstein, where MobilCom is based, should the
current spat between the German telecoms group and its French major
shareholder escalate still further, the newspaper said, quoting local
government sources.
Handelsblatt also quoted company sources as saying that the French
government had instructed the semi-public telecoms giant to end its
relationship with MobilCom so as to prevent France Telecom's debt
mountain from growing further.
The Schleswig Holstein government wants to prevent MobilCom from
becoming insolvent, and threatening 6,000 jobs, if that were the case.
MobilCom and France Telecom are at loggerheads over the cost of
building up a new UMTS mobile phone network in Germany.
The heavily-indebted French group does not want to invest an estimated
10 billion euros (8.7 billion dollars) in MobilCom's new network. But
the German firm believes the sum was contractually agreed.
