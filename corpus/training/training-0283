International Marine Conference Opens
More than 100 marine biologists gathered here today to share their
insights into the research and conservation work in the South China
Sea, which is regarded as one of the most biologically diverse oceans
in the world.
The Third International Conference on the Marine Biology of the South
China Sea opened here Monday, which is a venue for scientists to extend
their cooperation on the physical and biological study on the body of
water. The South China Sea, with an area of some 2.25 million sq km,
has a high research value for its floristic and faunistic diversity.
According to the organizer, this year's meeting is more focusing on the
ecological conservation and protection of the Sea compared with the two
previous conferences -- one was held in Hong Kong in 1990 and the other
in Guangzhou in 1993.
One of the main themes addressed at the current conference is coastal
zone management and conservation of the biological resources of the
South China Sea, said Professor Brian Morton, chairman of the
organizing committee.
He listed a number of problems facing marine biology in the South China
Sea, such as rising coastal population, coastal pollution,
over-exploitation of resources, habitat loss and general degradation of
water.
In his view, marine biologists should shoulder their responsibilities
-- do research, teach people, act as independent advisors to
governments and promote the concepts of conservation and protection.
"The future is in our hands, not in our children's," said the chairman,
who is a professor of marine ecology from the Swire Institute of Marine
Science under the University of Hong Kong. He was also organizer of the
first conference on the South China Sea held in Hong Kong in 1990.
The five-day meeting drew participants from 13 countries and regions,
including Australia, the United States, the Philippines, Malaysia,
Thailand, and China and its Hong Kong and Taiwan.
