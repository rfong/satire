Arafat, Peres Decide To Move Into Secret Talks To Break Impasse 
PLO chief Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said
Wednesday they would hold secret, top-level talks to to break the
impasse over West Bank troop withdrawal.
``We feel the best way to arrive at an agreement is doing it
discreetly...and on a very high level,'' Peres told reporters after
two-and-a-half hours of talks at Arafat's office.
Arafat said he would communicate with Peres and Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin ``through the telephone, faxes and meetings.'' He said he
and Peres made progress in Wednesday's talks, but neither divulged
details.
The Palestinians told the Israeli delegation it was imperative to reach
agreement soon because of eroding support in the West Band and Gaza for
the peace process.
``I think the foreign minister is aware of the urgency,'' Arafat
spokesman Marwan Kanafani told reporters.
Under the Israel-PLO accord, Israeli soldiers were to pull out of
Palestinian towns in the West Bank on the eve of Palestinian general
elections, initially scheduled for no later than July 1994.
Implementation is behind schedule because Israel is wary of
redeployment following a series of bloody attacks on Israelis by Muslim
militants. Israeli army commanders have said they would have a hard
time protecting the 120,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank once
soldiers left the Palestinian towns.
Israel reportedly is offering the Palestinians a gradual troop pullout,
and Palestinian officials said Wednesday that Arafat was ready to
consider the idea.
Israeli leaders reportedly told Arafat in earlier meetings that he had
two choices.
He could either agree to elections in the near future in a move to win
broader legitimacy for his rule, but with troops remaining in most
Palestinian towns.
Or he could decide to negotiate the whole redeployment package,
including complicated security arrangements for the Jewish settlers,
but that this would likely postpone elections for another eight or nine
months.
It was not clear from Wednesday's statements whether the two sides had
opted for one of the two approaches.
