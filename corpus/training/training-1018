Europe set to approve final aid package for Air France 
The European Commission is expected to authorise next week the payment
of the final part of a 20 billion franc (four billion dollar) aid
package to state-owned Air France, a European source said Tuesday.
The public aid was approved by the commission in July 1994 but payment
of the final five billion francs was subject to the loss-making airline
meeting certain conditions under a restructuring plan.
However, the commission is only expected to authorise the immediate
payment of four billion francs, with the remaining one billion francs
on hold until the restructure plan is complete, the source said.
The commission had talks with French authorities over complaints from
its rivals about the distribution of air traffic at Orly airport in
Paris, a situation that has been resolved.
Several European airlines had also complained to the commission that
Air France had used the aid to the lower its prices. However, the
commission decided that the complaints were not sufficiently justified
to delay the decision on the aid package.
