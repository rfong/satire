Israel's National Airline Mulls Shifting to 
Israel's national airline El Al is considering revamping the airline's
fleet and shifting to smaller planes.
The board of directors of El Al will decide in the near future on the
proposed changes, local daily Haaretz said on Monday.
The proposal was raised by an international consulting group which
urged the national carrier to make an urgent change in its mix of
aircraft.
El Al currently has 13 Boeing 747 jumbo jets, which fly the bulk of El
Al's trans-Atlantic flights. Each of these planes can carry about 450
passengers.
The consulting group has studied the economic feasibility of the El
Al's moving to smaller aircraft for its long-distance routes.
Planes with 300 to 350 seats, it found, could offer greater flexibility
and cost savings for destinations like the United States, South Africa,
China, Thailand and India.
Likely candidates for these mid-sized aircraft include the Boeing 777
and Airbus A-340.
Meanwhile, El Al's fourth new Boeing 737 arrived last week. These
narrow-bodied aircraft can carry an average of about 140 passengers and
are intended to serve the company's European routes.
In addition to these 747s and 737s, El Al's fleet also includes six
Boeing 767s, designed to carry about 200 passengers, and nine Boeing
757s with a seating capacity of about 190 people.
