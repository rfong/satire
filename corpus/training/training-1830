Iran Reitrates Policy Against Israel 
Iran's Judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi on Wednesday
reiterated that confrontation with Israel enjoys high priority in
Iran's foreign policy and is the demand of the Iranian nation.
Shahroudi made the remark during his meeting with Lebanon's Ambassador
to Tehran Adnan Mansour Hassan, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
He called on Islamic countries to exert pressure on Israel in order to
restore their rights, and expressed his belief that "The Islamic
governments will not be trapped by the conspiracy of compromise with
Israel."
Iran cut off relations with Israel soon after the 1979 Islamic
revolution. It called for armed struggle against Israel's occupation of
Arab lands and vehemently opposed any compromise with what it called
"the Zionist regime."
The Judicial chief said that Israel is attempting to make compromise
with the Islamic and Arab governments because it is afraid of the
resistance by the Lebanese nation and a number of other Islamic and
Arab countries against its measures.
He also praised the resistance movement by the people in south Lebanon
against the Israeli occupation force there.
Israeli carved out a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in 1985
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
Lebanon's resistance movement, spearheaded by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been fighting to oust Israeli
troops and its ally, the South Lebanon Army, from the country.
The Lebanese ambassador for his part appreciated Iran's support to his
country, IRNA said.
