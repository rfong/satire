Beshir to visit Nairobi for talks with Moi 
Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir will visit Nairobi Tuesday for talks
with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi due to centre on Kenyan efforts
to mediate an end to Sudan's long-running civil war.
The State House announcement of the brief official visit -- Beshir will
arrive at noon (0900 GMT) and leave at 4:45 p.m. (1345 GMT) -- gave no
details of the subjects to be discussed.
But it came as Sudanese newspapers reported that Khartoum authorities
had contacted the Kenyan government to ask it to relaunch Nairobi's
effort to end the 13-year-long war between the junta and Christian and
animist rebels in southern Sudan.
The director general of the Sudanese government's high council for
peace, Moussa Sidahmed, said "more such contacts will be held after the
elections in Sudan," referring to presidential and general polls due to
run over almost two weeks next month, the state-run Al-Engaz al-Watani
daily reported Monday.
Sidahmed, who returned recently from a visit to Kenya, said the "Kenyan
leadership is still intent on continuing its efforts for realization of
peace and for making the IGADD (Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought
and Development) initiative a success."
The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which has split into
factions, has been fighting since 1983 to end domination of the south
by the Islamic, Arabised north. Kenya has spearheaded peace mediations
by the regional IGADD grouping, of which both countries are members.
Sidahmed said his visit to Kenya was aimed at "opening up avenues of
dialogue, in a direct form, with the rebel factions and at reaching
agreement on principles for negotiations."
The IGADD mediation committee, made up of Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda,
has organised several rounds of peace talks in Nairobi over the past
three years.
However, three IGADD members -- Ethiopia, Uganda, and Eritrea -- have
since broken off diplomatic relations with Sudan, amid accusations of
support for rebel groups and destabilisation.
