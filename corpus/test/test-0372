Israeli Scientist Invents New Method to Diagnose 
An Israeli scientist has invented a new method to distinguish between
malignant and benign tumors that may also help establish the prognosis
of cancer and monitor therapy's effectiveness.
The non-invasive method was developed by Professor Hadassa Degani from
the Weizman Institute, the July issue of the Nature Medicine magzine
published today reported in its cover story.
The method consists of injecting a contrast-enhancing dye-like material
into the patient's bloodstream and using magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to follow the way this material is absorbed and evacuated by the
tumor. Because the uptake and clearance differ in cancerous and benign
tumors, such monitoring makes a diagnosis possible.
A computer shows an image on a screen in various colors, reflecting the
distribution of the contrast material. The color patterns for malignant
and benign growths are strikingly different, Degani said.
She added that the method thus could reduce the number of biopsis
performed to diagnose tumors. "Most breast tumors detected by
mammography prove to be benign in a biopsy, so that a non-invasive
method like MRI could help reduce the rate of unnecessary procedures,"
Degani said.
The method could also tell doctors the prognosis of cancer because it
reveals tiny blood vessels that feed the cancer (in a process called
angiogenesis) and allow the tumor to grow and spread. Knowing their
density and ability to deliver materials to the tumor may make it
possible to determine the tumor's potential aggressiveness, said
Degani.
Monitoring the blood vessels and the spaces between cells may also help
evaluate the efficiency of treatment. A reduction in the vessel's
density and an increase in intra-cellular spaces could point to
successful therapy, She added.
In conventional MRI, signals emanating from the nuclei of hydrogen
atoms that make up water in the tissues are too weak to produce a
resolution comparable to that under a microscope.
But in Degani's method, resolution is very high because the
water-tissue signals are recorded over an extended period - two to four
minutes instead of the usual several seconds, the report said.
