Sichuan official gets suspended death sentence for corruption 
China has handed down a suspended death sentence to a mid-level party
official who accepted 680,000 yuan (82,000 dollars) in bribes, the
Worker's Daily reported Thursday.
Zhao Fuan, party secretary of the Sichuan Petroleum Co., collected his
ill-gotten gains over a three-year period until February 1995 and will
now face a two-year term in prison.
If the authorities decide he has reformed, his sentence will be
commuted to life imprisonment, otherwise he will be executed.
China's anti-graft dragnet has already snared thousands of officials
including the party secretary of Beijing, but a suspended death
sentence for such an offence remains rare.
