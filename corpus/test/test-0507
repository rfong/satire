Security Council tells Burundi rebels to cease fire
The UN Security Council called Tuesday for an immediate end to attacks by
rebels in Burundi, where at least 12 people have been killed in clashes
between government forces and rebels in recent days.
The council also welcomed an agreement between Burundi and the
neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) designed to prevent
Hutu rebels using the territory of DRC as a base for attacks on
Burundi.
"There can be no justification whatsoever for attacks by rebel groups,"
council president Jagdish Koonjul told reporters, adding that "council
members underlined that a ceasefire is the foremost priority."
Koonjul, ambassador of Mauritius to the United Nations, said the
council "urged the rebels to cease hostilities immediately and to enter
into negotiations" with the new power-sharing government set up on
November 1.
Two Hutu rebel groups -- the Force for the Defence of Democracy (FDD)
and the National Liberation Forces (FNL) -- refused to take part in the
political new deal, designed to end an eight-year war that claimed
250,000 lives.
On Sunday, officials and other sources in the capital, Bujumbura, said
at least 12 people, most of them civilians, had been killed in Burundi
since Thursday in rebel attacks or clashes between rebels and the army.
Koonjul, speaking after closed-door consultations, said the council
"welcomes the improvement of bilateral relations between the DRC and
Burundi, in particular the outcome of the recent visit by the foreign
minister of Burundi to Kinshasa."
The minister, Therence Sinunguruza, was in the capital of DRC on
January 8 and signed a joint statement saying that Burundi had agreed
to withdraw its troops from DRC.
The troops were sent across the border three years ago with the
officially stated aim of wiping out Burundian Hutu rebels and their
rear bases in the DRC.
As part of the agreement signed last week, Kinshasa said it would try
to prevent its territory being used as a base for attacks on Burundi.
Stressing "the importance of dialogue between Burundi and its
neighbours," Koonjul said council members "strongly encouraged the
governments of the DRC and Burundi to cooperate further in this
regard."
