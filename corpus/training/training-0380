Two More U.N. Aid Workers Released in Somalia 
Two of the four international aid workers still kept hostages by gunmen
in Mogadishu in the past three days were released on Friday.
Peter Paul Lamotte, a Belgian working for the World Health
Organization, and Mohammedi Mohammed, a French-Algerian national
working for the United Nations Children's Fund, flew shortly after
mid-day from the Al-Jasira airstrip controlled by warlord Muse Sudi
Yalahow to Kenyan capital Nairobi.
Omar Mohamud Mohamed, acting chairman of Yalahow, stressed that the
release of the two men is unconditional.
Dismissing earlier reports that the aid workers had been held hostages,
Omar said "they had unfortunately fallen in the middle of a fighting
between two groups" and "a serious pressure has been put on us by the
other side, so that we had no chance to hand them over to any
international agency."
As to the two other aid workers being held in Karan district controlled
by Yalahow, Omar said talks are in progress now and he hopes the two
aid workers will be released by Saturday.
Nine U.N. aid workers were on Tuesday caught in a fighting around a
compound in north Mogadishu between pro-government forces and
militiamen loyal to Yalahow. Five of them were released on Wednesday.
