F-16 Fighter Crashes in Arizona State in U.S. 
An F-16 fighter based at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona State of the
United States crashed Monday while on a training mission, the sixth
such crash in six months, said reports reaching here Tuesday.
Both pilots of the jet fighter ejected safely and appeared to be in
good condition, the reports quoted spokeswoman of the Air Force base
Airman Jiull Prost as saying.
Luke is the premier training ground for F-16 pilots in the United
States.
All 400 of the country's F-16s equipped with Pratt and Whitney engines
were grounded after an F-16 based at Luke crashed during a training
mission on March 26.
An inspection revealed hairline cracks in the engines of some of the
190 F-16s based at Luke that are equipped with Pratt and Whitney 220
engines.
The Air Force had said the planes would not fly until the cracks were
repaired. Flights were resumed several days ago and were back at the
normal level of about 160 a day.
The F-16s flying in the Kosovo airstrikes do not use the Pratt and
Whitney 220 engine, according to Air Force officials.
