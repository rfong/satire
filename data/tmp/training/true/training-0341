Worldwide/NNP Semiconductor/NNP Market/NNP to/TO Grow/NNP :/: Study/NNP The/DT worldwide/JJ semiconductor/NN market/NN will/MD grow/VB almost/RB 12/CD percent/NN in/IN 1999/CD ,/, following/VBG a/DT 6/CD percent/NN decline/NN this/DT year/NN ,/, according/VBG to/TO a/DT study/NN released/VBN Monday/NNP ./.

The/DT company/NN made/VBD forecasts/NNS of/IN the/DT semiconductor/NN market/NN with/IN and/CC without/IN DRAM/NNP ./.

With/IN DRAM/NNP ,/, worldwide/JJ semiconductor/NN revenue/NN will/MD reach/VB 155/CD billion/CD U.S./NNP dollars/NNS in/IN 1999/CD ./.

Excluding/VBG DRAM/NNP ,/, the/DT revenue/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO reach/VB 124/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS in/IN the/DT same/JJ year/NN ,/, up/RB 9.7/CD percent/NN over/IN the/DT 1998/CD revenue/NN ./.

Although/IN the/DT microprocessor/NN market/NN should/MD rebound/VB in/IN some/DT regions/NNS during/IN the/DT fourth/JJ quarter/NN this/DT year/NN ,/, Dataquest/NNP said/VBD ,/, the/DT global/JJ impact/NN of/IN weak/JJ Asian/JJ economies/NNS means/VBZ key/JJ semiconductor/NN markets/NNS will/MD likely/RB not/RB strengthen/VB until/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN 1999/CD ./.

The/DT semiconductor/NN market/NN will/MD continue/VB to/TO confront/VB oversupply/NN ,/, Dataquest/NNP said/VBD ./.
