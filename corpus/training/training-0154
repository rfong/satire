EU proposals on farm aid a big disappointment
An EU proposal to initially offer farmers in candidate countries only a
quarter of the aid of current members is disappointing and risks causing a
backlash against enlargement, Polish officials warned Tuesday.
"The issue is to guarantee equal partnership conditions to Polish
agriculture. If there aren't (equal conditions), our farmers will of
course vote against Poland's membership in the referendum. We must keep
this in mind," Polish Agriculture Minister Jaroslaw Kalinowski was
quoted as saying in the daily Rzeczpospolita.
The European Commission is due Wednesday to adopt a proposal to EU
member states that farmers in the 10 candidate countries initially get
only a quarter of the direct aid payments paid to farmers in current
member states after their countries join the bloc, as soon as in 2004.
The payments would be gradually increased until they equal those of
farmers in member states in 2013, EU sources said.
While cautioning he has only seen press reports, and the Commission has
yet to endorse the proposals, they are a "big disappointment," said
Deputy Agriculture Minister Jerzy Plewa.
"The real problem is not the percentage level of aid, but such a long
transition period of 10 years and the very principle of unequal
treatment," he told AFP.
Unequal subsidy levels is "irreconcilable with a fully open market" in
agricultural products, said Plewa.
He expressed hope that the proposals will be improved during
negotiations between the 15 member states on them.
Plewa did express satisfaction with some proposals for aid to very
small subsistence farms that don't produce for the market.
Some 36.4 percent of Polish farms are smaller than three hectares (7.4
acres), according to the 1996 agricultural census.
