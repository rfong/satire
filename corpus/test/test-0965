Anti-globalization forum again draws Bove, but not as a speaker
The second anti-globalization forum due to start Thursday is expected
to draw some 60,000 activists from 130 countries, the most famous of
them French anti-globalization leader Jose Bove.
Timed to coincide with the five-day World Economic Forum in New York,
the forum at this southeast Brazilian city claims diametrically opposed
views to those of global business and political leaders attending the
US-based summit.
Some 5,000 non-governmental organizations will be represented at Porto
Alegre, who believe that an alternative to worldwide neoliberal
policies exist, organizers said.
Bove, who has not been invited to speak at this year's event, but is,
organizers say, a welcome presence at the forum, gave few details of
his plans for this year's event. "First we will have a large meeting of
the Peasants Confederation" -- his group, he said.
But Brazilian police say this time around they will be ready for any of
Bove's antics.
The Frenchman shot to notoriety when he ransacked a partly-built
McDonald's restaurant in France in 1999.
Last year, his fame was reinforced when, during the anti-globalization
forum, he joined Brazil's Landless Peasants Movement in a violent
protest at research facilities run by US biotechnology firm Monsanto.
But the 48-year-old sheep farmer and activist sought this week to play
down his notoriety, protesting to reporters it had not been his plan to
take center stage at last year's event.
"I didn't choose what happened last year. The Brazilian police chose. I
wasn't alone. There were nearly 2,000 farmers ... who weren't
arrested," he said.
"Certain people embody the movement, and that allows you to say more. I
always speak in the name of the Peasants Confederation which is today
recognized as the number one confederation of peasant farmers," Bove
said.
He noted, however, that anti-globalization has picked up pace in the
last few years, and said the forum was a good venue to "oppose the
commercialization of the world."
While it was the Landless Peasants Movement that announced Bove's
arrival here Monday, a member of the forum organizing committee,
Candido Grybowski said: "He is welcome as a participant ... his
presence reinforces the forum."
In 1987, as sheep-farmer and producer of Roquefort cheese, Bove helped
set up the Peasants Confederation which champions small producers
against the interests of big business, supermarkets and the
agricultural barons.
With his sharp eye for publicity he once organized the ploughing up of
the park under the Eiffel Tower in Paris to protest EU farm policies.
In 1995, his command of English and media flare landed him a prized
place on board the ship Rainbow Warrior in the south Pacific to protest
France's resumption of nuclear tests.
