Iranian Bank Opens Account to Collect Aid for Palestinians 
Under the direction of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's
national bank opened on Sunday a current account for volunteer
donations to the Palestinians, the official IRNA news agency reported.
Muslims and non-Muslims worldwide can deposit to account numbers 702200
and 800 in the national bank, the agency said, adding that the move is
part of measures Iran is taking in support of Palestinians.
Earlier this week, a high-ranking Iranian cleric authorized the
allocation of a portion of the country's religious funds to help
Palestinian civilians who are currently in bloody clashes with Israeli
soldiers.
"All Muslims have to reinforce their resistance against Israel and
spare no efforts to help Palestinians in their uprising," said a decree
by Ayatollah Fazel Lankarani.
Meanwhile, Iran's state foundation has arranged for some 100
Palestinians, badly wounded in the recent violence, to be treated in
hospitals in Tehran.
The state-run Iran Insurance Company also said that it would cover the
costs for all wounded Palestinians accepted under the foundation's
program.
Iran does not recognize Israel and has firmly support Islamic
resistance against the Jewish state.
