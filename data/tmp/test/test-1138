Two/CD days/NNS after/IN Jacques/NNP Delors/NNP refused/VBD the/DT Socialist/JJ nomination/NN for/IN next/JJ spring/NN 's/POS presidential/JJ elections/NNS ,/, Bernard/NNP Tapie/NNP stepped/VBD forward/RB this/DT week/NN and/CC ,/, with/IN his/PRP$ customary/JJ panache/NN ,/, reassured/VBD the/DT French/JJ left/NN that/WDT not/RB all/RB was/VBD lost/VBN ./.

The/DT self-made/JJ millionaire-turned-politician/NN said/VBD he/PRP regretted/VBN that/IN Delors/NNP ,/, who/WP retires/VBZ next/JJ month/NN as/IN head/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP 's/POS executive/JJ commission/NN ,/, had/VBD decided/VBN not/RB to/TO run/VB ./.

But/CC he/PRP insisted/VBD that/IN the/DT left/NN still/RB stood/VBD a/DT chance/NN if/IN it/PRP could/MD agree/VB on/IN a/DT program/NN and/CC then/RB pick/VB a/DT respected/VBN outsider/NN as/IN its/PRP$ candidate/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD a/DT measure/NN of/IN the/DT Socialists/NNPS '/POS gloom/NN that/IN they/PRP were/VBD willing/JJ to/TO listen/VB to/TO him/PRP ./.

Tapie/NNP had/VBD contributed/VBN to/TO the/DT Socialist/JJ debacle/NN in/IN elections/NNS for/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP in/IN June/NNP by/IN leading/VBG his/PRP$ own/JJ ticket/NN ,/, which/WDT won/VBD 12/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT vote/NN ./.

Now/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, just/RB 24/CD hours/NNS after/IN he/PRP issued/VBD his/PRP$ call/NN for/IN leftist/JJ unity/NN ,/, Tapie/NNP has/VBZ himself/PRP been/VBN apparently/RB eliminated/VBN as/IN a/DT political/JJ player/NN ./.

On/IN Wednesday/NNP ,/, he/PRP was/VBD declared/VBN bankrupt/JJ by/IN a/DT commercial/JJ court/NN in/IN Paris/NNP and/CC barred/VBN from/IN running/VBG for/IN office/NN ./.

Under/IN French/JJ law/NN ,/, people/NNS found/VBN personally/RB bankrupt/JJ can/MD not/RB hold/VB political/JJ office/NN for/IN five/CD years/NNS ./.

Tapie/NNP has/VBZ appealed/VBN ./.

But/CC if/IN the/DT ruling/NN is/VBZ confirmed/VBN ,/, he/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO resign/VB his/PRP$ seats/NNS in/IN the/DT French/JJ National/NNP Assembly/NNP and/CC the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ./.

He/PRP also/RB still/RB faces/VBZ charges/NNS ,/, including/VBG tax/NN evasion/NN ,/, in/IN other/JJ pending/VBG cases/NNS ./.

Ever/RB defiant/JJ ,/, Tapie/NNP accused/VBD the/DT court/NN of/IN aligning/VBG itself/PRP with/IN the/DT conservative/JJ government/NN and/CC declared/VBD :/: ``/`` The/DT struggle/NN continues/VBZ ./. ''/''

But/CC his/PRP$ bankruptcy/NN nonetheless/RB struck/VBD another/DT blow/NN at/IN the/DT left/NN 's/POS hopes/NNS of/IN mounting/VBG a/DT credible/JJ challenge/NN to/TO the/DT conservatives/NNS ,/, who/WP govern/VB France/NNP in/IN a/DT coalition/NN and/CC control/VB more/JJR than/IN 80/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT seats/NNS in/IN the/DT National/NNP Assembly/NNP ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, only/RB Jacques/NNP Chirac/NNP ,/, a/DT former/JJ prime/JJ minister/NN who/WP heads/VBZ the/DT Gaullist/NNP party/NN ,/, has/VBZ announced/VBN his/PRP$ bid/NN for/IN the/DT conservative/JJ nomination/NN ./.

But/CC polls/NNS show/VBP that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ running/VBG far/RB behind/IN Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Edouard/NNP Balladur/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO announce/VB his/PRP$ candidacy/NN next/JJ month/NN ./.

In/IN practice/NN ,/, under/IN France/NNP 's/POS two-round/JJ electoral/JJ system/NN ,/, those/DT two/CD men/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN other/JJ conservative/JJ candidates/NNS can/MD test/VB their/PRP$ strength/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ round/NN of/IN voting/VBG on/IN April/NNP 23/CD ./.

And/CC if/IN Chirac/NNP and/CC Balladur/NNP emerged/VBD as/IN the/DT two/CD top/JJ vote-getters/NNS ,/, they/PRP would/MD face/VB each/DT other/JJ in/IN the/DT run-off/NN on/IN May/NNP 7/CD ./.

Delors/NNP 's/POS withdrawal/NN has/VBZ increased/VBN the/DT chances/NNS of/IN that/DT happening/NN ./.

Until/IN he/PRP rejected/VBD the/DT Socialist/JJ nomination/NN ,/, polls/NNS showed/VBD him/PRP ahead/RB of/IN both/DT Chirac/NNP and/CC Balladur/NNP ./.

But/CC this/DT reflected/VBD his/PRP$ own/JJ popularity/NN and/CC not/RB that/DT of/IN the/DT Socialists/NNPS ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, the/DT main/JJ reason/NN he/PRP gave/VBD for/IN not/RB running/VBG was/VBD that/IN he/PRP did/VBD not/RB want/VB to/TO ``/`` cohabit/VB ''/'' with/IN a/DT conservative/JJ prime/JJ minister/NN who/WP was/VBD unwilling/JJ to/TO carry/VB out/RP his/PRP$ program/NN ./.

The/DT implication/NN was/VBD clear/JJ :/: Even/RB if/IN he/PRP won/VBD and/CC called/VBD new/JJ parliamentary/JJ elections/NNS ,/, the/DT Socialists/NNPS would/MD not/RB win/VB a/DT majority/NN ./.

The/DT Socialists/NNPS have/VBP given/VBN themselves/PRP until/IN late/RB January/NNP to/TO find/VB a/DT new/JJ candidate/NN ,/, and/CC several/JJ names/NNS have/VBP already/RB been/VBN mentioned/VBN ,/, most/RBS prominently/RB that/DT of/IN Jack/NNP Lang/NNP ,/, a/DT former/JJ culture/NN minister/NN ./.

Michel/NNP Rocard/NNP ,/, a/DT former/JJ prime/JJ minister/NN who/WP sought/VBD the/DT nomination/NN before/IN he/PRP was/VBD eclipsed/VBN by/IN Delors/NNP ,/, has/VBZ said/VBD he/PRP will/MD not/RB run/VB ./.

A/DT key/JJ question/NN ,/, though/RB ,/, is/VBZ whether/IN the/DT Socialists/NNPS will/MD heed/VB the/DT advice/NN offered/VBN by/IN Tapie/NNP this/DT week/NN ./.

He/PRP warned/VBD that/IN they/PRP will/MD lose/VB unless/IN they/PRP form/VBP a/DT broad/JJ coalition/NN of/IN anti-conservative/JJ forces/NNS and/CC pick/VB a/DT fresh/JJ face/NN from/IN outside/IN the/DT party/NN as/IN its/PRP$ candidate/NN ./.

He/PRP even/RB suggested/VBD a/DT name/NN --/: Robert/NNP Badinter/NNP ,/, a/DT Mitterrand/NNP ally/NN who/WP is/VBZ now/RB president/NN of/IN France/NNP 's/POS Constitutional/NNP Court/NNP ./.
