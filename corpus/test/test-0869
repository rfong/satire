Kohl calls for negotiated solution in Chechyna 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl called Thursday for a negotiated solution to the
armed conflict between Russia and the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
Expressing his concern at the scale of the fighting in Chechnya, Kohl
said that he had spoken about it Wednesday with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin by telephone.
The chancellor reiterated the German government's position that the
conflict is an internal Russian affair, but said it was up to the
Russian government and parliament to find a mutually agreed solution
with Chechyna to end the bloodshed.
It was the first time Kohl had spoken on the telephone with Yeltsin
since the start on December 11 of the Russian armed intervention to put
down the Chechnya secession.
