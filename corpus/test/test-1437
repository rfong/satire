Child finds grandpa's arms cache
A child playing in his garden found a cache of grenades and rounds of
ammunition that belonged to his late grandfather, police said Tuesday
in this eastern French town.
They said they suspect the 40 British Mills grenades and cartridges had
been parachuted by the allies in World War II to the grandfather, who
was a French resistance fighter.
Five-year-old Florian was playing in the garden shed and found the
cache when he moved a stone. It contained a metal box full of the
grenades which though rusty still had their detonators. Two other boxes
contained eight millimetre Italian Carcano cartridges and German Mauser
cartridges dating from 1942.
Bomb disposal experts were called in to to remove the grenades.
