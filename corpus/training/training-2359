With Sports-Figure Skating-Worlds 
Defending champions Oksana Grischuk and Yevgeny Platov skated an
impeccable if unspectacular ballroom routine to hold on to their title
at the World Figure Skating Championships Friday.
Also the Olympic champions, the Russian pair collected a sweep of 5.8s
for technical merit and seven 5.9s and two 5.8s for artistic impression
after their free dance to a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers-style
routine to the soundtrack of Stepping Out.
Finland's Susanna Rahkamo and Petri Kokko, the European Champions, won
the silver despite being the clear winner so far as the 6,600 fans at
the NEC Arena were concerned. They placed third at last year's Worlds
and fourth at the Olympics.
The bronze went to French couple Sophie Moniotte and Pascal Lavanchy,
runners up last year and also second at this year's European
Championships.
