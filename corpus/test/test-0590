Assembly Elects S.Africa to Replace Zimbabwe as 
The General Assembly this afternoon elected South Africa as
vice-president for the 52nd session, replacing Zimbabwe, who was
elected Tuesday vice-president as well as chairman of the Fourth
Committee.
The change was made on the basis of rule of the assembly's Rules of
Procedure which states that "no two members of the General Committee
shall be members of the same delegation." The General Committee, which
comprises the assembly president, the 21 vice-presidents and the
chairmen of the main committees, was therefore not properly
constituted.
The 21 vice-presidents of the current session are China, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Guinea, Ireland,
Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Mongolia, Panama, Qatar, the Russian
Federation, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa, Togo, the
United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam.
