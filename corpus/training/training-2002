Israeli warplanes buzz south Lebanon 
Israeli warplanes flew at low altitude over parts of south Lebanon
early Tuesday drawing heavy anti-aircraft fire from Lebanese army
positions, police said.
The flights, which began Monday evening and were continuing
intermittently in the early hours of Tuesday, were concentrated mainly
over the port city of Tyre 85 kilometers (51 miles) south of Beirut.
Lebanese army troops in Tyre opened up with anti-aircraft guns but
apparently missed their targets.
Earlier the planes had buzzed the port city of Sidon further north.
"It is nothing unusual," a security official in south Lebanon said.
Israel has threatened to step up its military activity in Lebanon
because of increased attacks by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and is
also considering plans to deport, possibily to Lebanon, Palestinian
Islamic militants.
Israel has placed its forces on alert after Hezbollah attacks which
have left five Israeli soldiers dead and 17 wounded in the past two
weeks.
Hezbollah, which also placed its forces on alert, have warned against
any large-scale attack by Israel and vowed to fire Katyusha rockets at
northern Israel if Lebanese civilians were hurt.
Security services in the south Lebanon "security zone" occupied by
Israel said Israeli tanks were moving between positions but that no
reinforcements had been brought in from northern Israel.
Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak said Monday his country was capable
of striking at Hezbollah fighters without harming Lebanese civilians.
"The Israeli army can find ways to hit Hezbollah while taking care to
avoid civilian losses," Barak said, interviewed by state television on
the possibility of an Israeli attack in Lebanon.
"The army must strike Hezbollah where and how it finds it," said Barak,
accusing Lebanon and Syria of doing nothing to stop Hezbollah from
carrying out anti-Israeli attacks.
