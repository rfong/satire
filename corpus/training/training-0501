Italy Calls in Army to Stem Arrivals 
Up to 1,000 soldiers will be assigned to patrol the southern Adriatic
coast to try to block a growing number of boats smuggling foreigners
into Italy, an official said Tuesday.
The first group of soldiers were assigned to the patrols last week and
between 500 and 1,000 will take part in the mission, said Corrado
Catenacci, police chief in the Bari region.
The use of troops is attempted to stem the flow of clandestine boats
traveling from Albania to southeast Italy carrying illegal immigrants,
including Kurds, Albanians and Chinese.
``The operation will end when the flow of foreigners stops,'' said
Catenacci.
Officials have constructed temporary holding centers for immigrants
nabbed by the patrols. Other vessels are turned back to Albania.
