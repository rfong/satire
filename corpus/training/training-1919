Afghan Opium Output Rises to Record Level
Afghanistan's total production of raw opium for 1999 was estimated to
be a record 4,600 metric tons, more than doubling the production of
2,100 tons in 1998, according to a U.N. survey released here Friday.
The annual opium survey conducted by the United Nations International
Drug Control Program (UNDCP) indicates that the area under poppy
cultivation increased by 43 percent from 64,000 hectares in 1998 to
some 91,000 hectares.
"The record output in Afghanistan is a cause for great concern," stated
a U.N. official when releasing the survey here.
"UNDCP has been very successful in working together with a number of
countries towards reducing production of illicit drugs. Unfortunately
this has not been the case in Afghanistan and the results are there for
all to see," he said.
He added that it is imperative to strengthen the drug control
capabilities of the countries which border Afghanistan.
