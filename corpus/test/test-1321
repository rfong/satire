England coach vows to go for high-speed win against Sweden
Sven-Goran Eriksson has vowed England will play for a win in their
World Cup opener against Sweden on Sunday and will not adapt their
fast-paced style to suit what are expected to be hot conditions in
Saitama.
The first matches in World Cup groups are often cagey affairs with many
sides more anxious to avoid defeat than secure the three points but the
England coach said he would be disappointed with any of his players if
they adopted that attitude.
"I really hope we don't have players in the group saying it is
important not to lose," he said after announcing that inspirational
captain David Beckham would be fit for the crucial clash with the
Swedes.
"I can agree that it is important not to lose but it is even more
important to win," Eriksson said.
"We are not starting the game Sunday trying to make a draw. We will try
to win the game and I'm sure Sweden will do the same thing because we
are all aware that we have Argentina in our group and, if I agree or
not does not matter, they are the favourites if you talk to football
experts around the world.
"So of course if you can have three points in the first game it will be
very good."
Eriksson has been encouraged to find the climatic conditions in Japan
easier than he had been anticipating with temperatures rising to around
27 degrees Celsius (81 degrees Fahrenheit) at the hottest part of the
day and considerably lower by the early evening, when Sunday's game
will be played.
"It's hotter than England but so far it's not been as hot as I
expected," Eriksson said. "So I expect that the game will be played at
a high pace.
"At least in the beginning we are going to try to play as we do
normally."
The Swede has faced criticism in recent weeks that his England lineups
have started to rely too heavily on long balls hit in behind defenders
for forwards and wide midfield players to chase, an approach that is
harder to sustain when it gets hot and steamy.
Eriksson promised that Sweden and the rest of the world would see a
radically different England from the sides which failed to impress in
warm-up draws against South Korea last week and Cameroon on Sunday.
He said the friendlies against two sides with radically different
styles had been a worthwhile exercise, but warned against reading too
much into them.
"Especially, if you take the last game against Cameroon, we had four,
five or six players who did their job and nothing more. They already
knew they'll play against Sweden, so why should they do more than just
their job.
"Those players will play much better on Sunday when the World Cup
starts. Of course we have to play better and we will play better."
Eriksson admitted Sunday's match was likely to be an emotional affair
but not because he was coming up against his native country.
"Whichever team we meet in the World Cup it will be emotional," he
said. "I don't think I'll feel anything just because it is Sweden
because you are very focussed on the game.
"When you have three games in the group all three games are like a
final to you."
