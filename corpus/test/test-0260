Air Force Officer Cleared in Deadly Attack on U.S. Helicopters
A military jury cleared an Air Force officer Tuesday in last year's
friendly fire attack on two U.S. helicopters over Iraq, closing the
book on the case with no one held criminally responsible for the 26
deaths.
The verdict came in the court-martial of Capt. Jim Wang, who was a
radar officer in charge of monitoring the no-fly zone over northern
Iraq when two F-15 fighter pilots shot down the Army helicopters on
April 14, 1994.
``One of the jurors said to me after the verdict was read that the Air
Force does what's right,'' said Wang, 29. ``When given the opportunity,
I'm glad we still can do that.''
The jury of 10 officers could have discharged Wang and given him up to
three months in prison on each of three counts of dereliction of duty.
``I was surprised. I thought we were going to get a conviction,'' said
Maj. Robert Coacher, the lead prosecutor.
Wang will be returned to duty but told reporters he isn't sure whether
he will stay in the Air Force.
In recent months, criminal charges against five other officers and one
of the fighter pilots in the case were dropped, and the Air Force said
it has no plans to reopen the investigation.
In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry defended the
military's handling of the attack, saying some officers were punished
with administrative sanctions and ``many officers' careers were very
adversely affected by this.''
Seven officers, including the two F-15 pilots and three members of the
crew of Wang's radar-monitoring plane, received letters of reprimand or
admonishment, which can hurt their chances of promotion, the Pentagon
said.
Also, a member of Wang's crew received an Article 15, a more severe
administrative penalty that can result in docked pay, confinement to
quarters, reassignment to a lesser job or some other punishment. The
name of the person receiving the Article 15 and the specific punishment
were not revealed.
``Justice was done,'' the Air Force's top legal official, Maj. Gen.
Nolan Sklute, declared. He said, ``An incident like this does not
necessarily mean that the conduct of all those involved rises to the
level of criminal culpability.''
Wang himself called for another Air Force investigation and
congressional hearings if necessary.
``For me this is just a victory in one battle,'' he said. ``There are
still two helicopters shot down and 26 lives lost. This court-martial
is one small piece in the puzzle.''
Wang was senior director on an Airborne Warning and Control System
plane the morning the helicopters were shot down. The zone was
established by the U.S.-led allies after the Gulf War.
Wang was accused of not actively supervising two officers below him,
not keeping an accurate picture of the area and not informing the F-15s
there were friendly helicopters in the zone.
Two F-15 pilots shot down the Black Hawk helicopters after mistaking
them for Iraqi aircraft.
The helicopters were carrying members of an international group that
had been working with the Kurds in northern Iraq since the end of the
1991 war. Fifteen of the victims were Americans. Other passengers
included five Kurds employed by the United States and military officers
from Britain, France and Turkey.
Kaye Mounsey, whose husband, Army Warrant Officer Erik Mounsey, was one
of the helicopter pilots killed, held up a photograph of his charred
remains and cried after the verdict was read.
``They are going to walk away and have peace with themselves,'' said
Mounsey, who lives in Culver City, California. ``I have a little
daughter who will never know her father and it's not right.''
