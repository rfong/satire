All/DT previous/JJ efforts/NNS to/TO rescue/VB the/DT 118/CD crew/NN aboard/IN the/DT vessel/NN have/VBP failed/VBN and/CC Russian/JJ officials/NNS said/VBD Saturday/NNP that/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT submariners/NNS probably/RB died/VBD minutes/NNS after/IN the/DT Kursk/NNP went/VBD down/RP to/TO the/DT Barents/NNP Sea/NNP floor/NN on/IN August/NNP 12/CD ./.

Any/DT survivors/NNS may/MD already/RB be/VB dead/JJ by/IN now/RB ./.

``/`` Most/JJS possibly/RB ,/, we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO admit/VB that/IN our/PRP$ worst/JJS expectations/NNS have/VBP materialized/VBN ,/, ''/'' Vice/NNP Admiral/NNP Mikhail/NNP Motsak/NNP ,/, chief/NN of/IN the/DT Northern/NNP Fleet/NNP ,/, told/VBD a/DT special/JJ program/NN on/IN RTR/NNP television/NN Saturday/NNP in/IN the/DT starkest/JJ statement/NN so/RB far/RB ./.

According/VBG to/TO Russian/JJ reports/NNS ,/, the/DT divers/NNS would/MD try/VB to/TO manually/RB unscrew/VB a/DT lid/NN leading/VBG to/TO the/DT sub/NN 's/POS escape/NN chamber/NN ./.

Pressure/NN -/: measuring/NN devices/NNS located/VBN inside/IN the/DT hatch/NN would/MD give/VB the/DT rescue/NN team/NN an/DT idea/NN about/IN conditions/NNS inside/IN the/DT Kursk/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ still/RB no/DT final/JJ word/NN on/IN what/WP caused/VBD the/DT accident/NN ,/, but/CC Motsak/NNP ,/, the/DT chief/NN of/IN the/DT Northern/NNP Fleet/NNP ,/, said/VBD there/EX were/VBD three/CD possible/JJ versions/NNS ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ a/DT powerful/JJ dynamic/JJ blow/NN that/WDT may/MD have/VB occurred/VBN on/IN collision/NN with/IN another/DT object/NN ./.

Motsak/NNP said/VBD three/CD foreign/JJ submarines/NNS were/VBD spotted/VBN in/IN the/DT accident/NN zone/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT area/NN under/IN constant/JJ observation/NN by/IN foreign/JJ intelligence/NN services/NNS ./.
