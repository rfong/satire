Kuwait and Iran here on Monday signed a five-year agreement on
providing Iranian labor for Kuwait, reported the Kuwait News Agency.
The document was inked by Kuwaiti Minister of Commerce, Industry, Labor
and Social Affairs Abdul Wahab Mohammad Al-Wazzan and visiting Iranian
Minister of Labor Hussein Kamali.
Following the signing ceremony, Al-Wazzan asserted Kuwait's high demand
for Iranian labor, especially experts of electronics and computer and
industry engineers.
