Some Macao Legislators Apply to Go Through Handover 
Some elected members of the current Macao Legislative Assembly have
applied to enter the first Legislative Council of the future Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
On Monday, nine elected legislators went to the Macao office of the
Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR and filled
in forms which confirm their qualification of becoming legislators of
the Macao SAR.
The Macao Legislative Assembly consists of 23 members, including seven
appointed by the governor and 16 elected by individual voters or
certain social organizations.
The elected legislators are required to go to the Macao office of the
secretariat from August 9 to 20 in person and fill in qualification
confirmation forms, which will be examined at the plenary session of
the Preparatory Committee to be held at the end of this month.
Comprising the same number of 23, the first Legislative Council of the
Macao SAR will be formally set up on December 20 when China resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao and the Macao SAR is established.
