Gingrich/NNP sees/VBZ 2-week/JJ extension/NN of/IN stopgap/JJ spending/NN bill/NN from/IN Friday/NNP The/NNP US/NNP House/NNP of/IN Representatives/NNPS will/MD approve/VB a/DT two-week/JJ extension/NN to/TO a/DT temporary/JJ spending/NN bill/NN from/IN Friday/NNP if/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT agreement/NN with/IN President/NNP Bill/NNP Clinton/NNP on/IN financing/VBG still-unfunded/JJ programs/NNS ,/, Speaker/NNP Newt/NNP Gingrich/NNP said/VBD here/RB Tuesday/NNP ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP could/MD pass/VB a/DT two-week/JJ extension/NN ,/, ''/'' Gingrich/NNP said/VBD after/IN leaving/VBG a/DT National/NNP Association/NNP of/IN Home/NNP Builders/NNP conference/NN ./.

The/DT House/NNP last/JJ week/NN passed/VBD an/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN that/WDT would/MD fund/VB the/DT government/NN for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT fiscal/JJ year/NN ,/, which/WDT ends/VBZ September/NNP 30/CD ,/, and/CC the/DT Senate/NNP was/VBD set/VBN to/TO vote/VB on/IN a/DT similar/JJ measure/NN Tuesday/NNP ./.

But/CC Clinton/NNP has/VBZ vowed/VBD to/TO veto/VB the/DT legislation/NN on/IN grounds/NNS that/IN it/PRP cuts/VBZ too/RB deeply/RB into/IN spending/VBG on/IN education/NN ,/, the/DT environment/NN and/CC health/NN care/NN programs/NNS ./.

The/DT current/JJ stopgap/NN bill/NN expires/VBZ at/IN midnight/NN March/NNP 15/CD and/CC the/DT threat/NN of/IN a/DT presidential/JJ veto/NN had/VBD raised/VBN fears/NNS here/RB of/IN another/DT partial/JJ shutdown/NN of/IN the/DT federal/JJ government/NN ,/, similar/JJ to/TO those/DT of/IN late/JJ last/JJ year/NN and/CC January/NNP ./.

The/DT money/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN for/IN nine/CD Cabinet/NNP departments/NNS and/CC several/JJ other/JJ agencies/NNS that/WDT have/VBP so/RB far/RB this/DT fiscal/JJ year/NN been/VBN living/VBG on/IN temporary/JJ appropriations/NNS ./.

They/PRP have/VBP been/VBN caught/VBN in/IN a/DT lingering/VBG dispute/NN between/IN the/DT administration/NN and/CC the/DT Republican-controlled/JJ Congress/NNP on/IN social/JJ spending/NN ./.

The/DT House/NNP bill/NN would/MD add/VB 3.4/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS to/TO the/DT budget/NN and/CC the/DT Senate/NNP measure/NN 4.7/CD billion/CD ./.

But/CC Clinton/NNP is/VBZ demanding/VBG that/IN eight/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS be/VB restored/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO preserve/VB domestic/JJ programs/NNS ./.

Political/NNP analysts/NNS here/RB had/VBD predicted/VBN that/IN Congressional/NNP Republicans/NNPS would/MD avoid/VB another/DT showdown/NN with/IN the/DT White/NNP House/NNP at/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN a/DT presidential/JJ campaign/NN and/CC would/MD send/VB Clinton/NNP a/DT straightforward/JJ bill/NN to/TO keep/VB the/DT agencies/NNS running/VBG for/IN several/JJ more/JJR weeks/NNS ./.

In/IN confrontations/NNS late/RB last/JJ year/NN ,/, polls/NNS made/VBD it/PRP clear/VBP that/IN the/DT electorate/NN held/VBD Congress/NNP responsible/JJ for/IN the/DT deadlock/NN ./.

The/DT temporary/JJ measure/NN would/MD probably/RB allow/VB the/DT agencies/NNS to/TO limp/VB along/RP under/IN an/DT authorization/NN to/TO spend/VB no/DT more/JJR than/IN 75/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT funding/NN level/NN in/IN fiscal/JJ 1995/CD ./.
