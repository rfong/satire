Son denies Sheikh Jamri trying to topple Bahrain government 
The son of Bahrain's main Shiite opposition leader, Sheikh Abdel Amir
al-Jamri, denied Friday that his father was linked to an alleged
Iranian-backed plot to overthrow the government in Manama.
Mansur Jamri, exiled in Britain, said his father, a 56-year-old cleric
imprisoned in Bahrain, was "not linked to any attempt to overthrow the
regime, nor any armed group or foreign country," according to a
statement received by AFP in Nicosia.
"We call on the government to stop this comedy, which will have only
one result and that is to stir up anger in the streets of Bahrain and
the people's determination to see the parliament re-established," said
Jamri, a member of the exiled Bahrain Freedom Movement (BFM).
Bahraini state television on Wednesday aired the confessions of six
Shiite Moslem militants accused of trying to overthrow their government
with the help of Iran.
The militants said they belonged to an Iranian-backed group called
Hezbollah-Bahrain and charged that Sheikh Jamri, who has been in prison
since January, headed it.
"We categorically deny this attempt to unjustly accuse the leaders who
have sincerely worked to end the political crisis in Bahrain, and we
believe that the only solution is to respect the constitutional rights
of the citizens," Jamri added in his statement.
Since December 1994 Bahrain has been hit by anti-government unrest led
by Shiite Moslems demanding a restoration of the parliament that was
suspended in 1975 by the Sunni Moslem-led authorities.
At least 22 people have been killed and many others injured in the
violence which has included explosions of home-made bombs,
firebombings, stabbings and beatings.
