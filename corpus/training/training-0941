Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana Madariaga will visit Sweden July
5 for talks with his Swedish counterpart Lena Hjelm-Wallen, the foreign
ministry announced Tuesday.

said.
Spain took over the rotating six-month presidency of the EU from France
on July 1, and the visit to Stockholm is part of a Spanish tour to all
EU capitals.
