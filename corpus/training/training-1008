Floods Hit Central Angolan Provinces 
Floods of the Kwanza River and Lukala River have driven more than
20,000 residents in Angola's central province of Kwanza-Norte to
desperation, the official Angolan news agency Angop reported Monday.
According to the government of the Kambambe Municipality, the village
of Massangano has suffered much from the flood, which devastated most
of the agricultural fields in the village, leaving the residents in
dire need of food and medicines.
Reports on casualties and injuries are not available yet.
The fierce floods were attributed to the recent heavy rains in the
central-north region of Angola, where the mentioned rivers rise in.
Heavy rains have also caused inundations in the central coastal
province of Benguela, killing 16 and displaced 2,000 families.
The Angolan government has declared the state of emergency in the town
of Dombe-Grande, which was ruined by the Coporolo River.
The central government is currently discussing how to avoid heavy
losses and preparing for sending humanitarian assistance to the
victims.
