EU to Compare Public Transport Systems in Cities 
Commuters may now have a chance to enjoy better services by public
transport systems after the European Commission has found out what
needs to be improved and how.
The commission launched a project to compare public transport systems
in 15 cities and regions in nine European countries, the commission
announced on Tuesday.
Public authorities and operators responsible for local and regional
passenger transport should be able to compare the performance of their
transport system with good practice elsewhere, commission officials
said.
The comparison will help them to understand how they can improve and
give them an incentive to act.
Participating in the commission project of comparing public transport
systems are Oulu in Finland, Bremen, Stuttgart and Dresden in Germany,
Graz in Austria, Athens in Greece, Lisbon in Portugal, Temi and Genoa
in Italy, Nantes and Ile-de-France in France, Merseyside, Glasgow and
Edinburgh in Britain as well as Prague in the Czech Republic.
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European Union, is
funding a special project that is designed to define the benchmark for
local passenger transport systems.
The commission also considered to award, from 1999 onwards, quality
labels or special prizes to encourage the use of public transport
benchmarks for quality services in European cities.
