Peace Serves Interest of Middle East Peoples: Mubarak 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stressed on Monday that "peace is in
the interest of all peoples in the Middle East."
In a televised speech to mark the 11th anniversary of the total
recovery of Sinai, Mubarak said the peoples in the region are " looking
forward to a historic overall reconciliation that will put a just end
to an era of pains and sufferings."
The peace process between Arab countries and Israel has made long
strides and "should not be obstructed by petty ambitions," the Egyptian
leader said.
Mubarak underlined that the Sinai liberation anniversary "gives us an
incentive to be more keen on rendering the peace efforts a success."
The Sinai Liberation Day, which falls on April 25, "makes us more
persistent on overcoming impediments facing settlement efforts in order
to bring about peace and security in the Middle East," he added.
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in
1979. Israel withdrew from Taba, a resort in eastern Sinai, in 1989,
enabling Egypt to recover the last part of its territories occupied by
the Jewish state in Mideast wars.
