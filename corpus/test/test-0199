France prepares troops for Rwanda, despite rebel opposition by Henri Mamarbachi 
France prepared to send troops on a humanitarian mission to stem the
conflict in Rwanda, which continued apace Sunday, flying in the face of
hostility by Rwandan Patriotic Front forces.
Observers in Kigali saw French intervention, especially outside
government-held territory, as a high risk operation in view of the
RPF's fierce opposition, amid fierce fighting which continued to dog UN
attempts to evacuate civilians Sunday.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, visiting Dakar, said Saturday the
French-led operation could go ahead "as from next week," assuming the
United Nations gave the plan its blessing.
Juppe said the UN Security Council would make a decision by Tuesday on
the issue and stressed France would act neither without UN backing nor
alone.
France is already assured of the support of UN Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali and that of at least the United States and Italy
for the "strictly humanitarian" operation.
But to date, only Senegal has specifically said it is willing to
associate itself with the mission, to which France is to commit up to
2,000 troops.
French President Francois Mitterrand said Saturday that "one or two"
unnamed African states had reacted favourably to the proposed action
but were waiting to take their lead from European countries.
The French defence ministry would not be drawn on exactly what form the
mission would take, merely indicating France would deploy its forces
"on Rwanda's frontiers." Observers cited Zaire as the most likely
deployment zone.
French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua said meanwhile he was "shocked"
by the attitude of the international community, which he said should
take a share of the blame for the wave of massacres in Rwanda.
Pasqua told French television that France was at the forefront of moves
to act to stem the bloodshed with its initiative, but admitted "we
should have taken initiatives earlier."
The French decision to commit troops came after a meeting of senior
officials, including Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and presidential
and defence ministry staff, at the prime ministerial residence Le
Matignon.
The mainly-Tutsi rebel forces have accused Paris of siding with the
government and urged other countries not to support France's "sinister
plan."
"France will be considered as a hostile force" if it sends troops to
Rwanda, the director of the rebels' Brussels bureau James Rwego said.
RPF militia in Kigali are hostile to a French-led intervention --
though primarily designed to stop massacres by Hutu militia of which
Tutsis have largely been the victims -- as they believe Paris armed and
trained forces loyal to former president Juvenal Habyarimana, killed in
a suspected attack on his plane on April 6.
His killing unleashed the civil war bloodbath in Rwanda believed to
have killed around 500,000 people.
Belgium, former administrative power in Rwanda and very much out of
favour with the Rwandan government, has decided not to join the French
initiative, but says it may provide logistical support.
Pope John Paul II meanwhile urged the international community to take
action to bring about a ceasefire to stop the "atrocious massacres,"
which he called a "very grave sin."
