Dark as a Dungeon: A Miner's Tale in South Africa 
He was an 18-year-old farm boy when he ventured down into the Earth to
dig out gold ore.
On his first day working in the dark, alien world, Malefetsane Mare got
lost in the labyrinthine tunnels and panicked.
Conjuring images from the only life he knew in the mountains of his
native Lesotho, he mistook water and electricity lines for snakes. He
fled deeper and deeper, until he met a miner drilling at the rock face.
``I thought it was the head of the snake I had been trying to avoid,''
Mare recalls, laughing 28 years later at ``the snake that ate my
life.''
Now a union shop steward at the Western Deep Levels mine southwest of
Johannesburg, Mare is one of the millions of black men who for more
than a century have fueled an industry at the heart of South Africa's
economy and its troubled racial history.
The wealth they extract from the deepest mines in the world account for
25 percent of South Africa's foreign currency earnings, allowing white
magnates to build shiny skyscrapers and lavish mansions.
But for the black miners there was only dirty, backbreaking work,
modest pay and the ever present risk of an early death.
That may be changing now that South Africa has a black-led government
sympathetic to the mostly black National Union of Mineworkers. The
union's list of demands, in preparation for contract negotiations later
this year, has been titled: ``Addressing the legacy of apartheid.''
``Liberation has been achieved. Now people want to see fundamental
changes in the work place,'' said Gwede Mantashe, the union's assistant
general secretary.
Mine owners say they are willing to talk, but both sides predict change
will be slow.
The union wants affirmative action programs to move blacks into
higher-paying, higher-skilled jobs once reserved for whites. It is
demanding housing for blacks who under apartheid were barred from
living in white towns near the mines. It also wants improved safety.
Mare has been burned in explosions and trapped by rock falls. Thick
scars on his chest come from his most frightening accident -- four
years ago, ropes used to hoist ore to the surface wrapped around him,
twisting tight enough to break two ribs and choke him unconscious.
``If I were 18 again and knowing what has taken place, I would never
have come to the mines,'' Mare said. ``I would rather have been a
farmer taking care of the cows.''
Last year, 358 gold miners died in earth tremors, rock falls,
explosions and other accidents, and more than 6,000 were injured,
according to the Chamber of Mines, a cooperative of major South African
mine owners.
Nearly 400,000 workers, many of them migrants from neighboring
countries, work above and below the ground in mines like Mare's Western
Deep Levels.
They seek a ribbon of gold-bearing ore, no wider than two hands splayed
against the rock wall, running more than two kilometers (1.2 miles)
beneath the surface. At that depth, the heat saps the body and the
pressure can burst rock, a phenomenon that kills several workers every
year.
Wiry at 45, Mare seems perfectly suited to crawling through tunnels
amid broken ore and water with sharp rock overhead. Temperatures reach
into the 90s Fahrenheit (30s Celsius) and the air is thick with dust
and the smell of explosives. Nine-hour shifts coat workers in sweat and
grime.
Mare's resigned attitude also seems made for a life that has changed
little over the decades. Known as ``Tsotsi,'' township slang for
``gangster,'' he says he was a brawler in his younger years.
The workers' dormitories where he has lived for nearly three decades
are a prescription for violence. Mare can almost touch the opposite
walls when he stretches out his arms in the room he shares with four
other workers. Lower-ranking workers live 18 to a room.
Management once segregated workers by ethnic group, adding to the
tinderbox conditions.
Apartheid banned housing black families in white towns. Those laws are
gone, but affordable housing remains a dream for many, so miners leave
behind wives and children and see them as little as once a year. The
loneliness promotes drunkenness, drug use and prostitution.
Laws that barred blacks from handling explosives and working at skilled
jobs in the mines also have been scrapped. But few have managed to
advance, and those who do complain of slights and verbal abuse from
whites.
Mare's first salary was 2.40 rand a week -- at a time when a loaf of
bread cost 10 cents and round trip home to Lesotho was 7 rand. He now
earns just under 500 rand (dlrs 140) a week, while a loaf of bread
costs 2.80 rand and the trip to Lesotho and back is 120 rand. His wage
is relatively good by black South African standards, but would be
considered paltry for a white worker.
When the union started organizing in the early 1980s, Mare joined. He
recently was elected shop steward and now spends most of his time above
ground, mediating disputes between workers and managers. He also is
helping the union set up literacy and training programs.
Although he sees some progress, it is not enough to recommend a miner's
life to his 17-year-old son, who is back in Lesotho with Mare's wife
and their three other children.
``I do not want my son to work in the mines,'' Mare said. ``But I may
be forced to see that, because there is no work.''
