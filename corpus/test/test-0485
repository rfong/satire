Seven National Conference workers, 14 others die in Kashmir
Moslem rebels shot dead seven supporters of the National Conference
party in the first major retaliation against political workers who
participated in last month's polls in Kashmir, police said Sunday.
Fourteen others, including 11 Moslem separatists, were also killed in
an upsurge of violence in the Himalayan state, which is set to see the
first elected provincial government in nine years on Tuesday.
The police said masked gunmen stormed the home of a National Conference
activist late Saturday in the northern Kashmiri district of Baramulla
and opened fire, killing the seven party workers.
The police in the state capital Srinagar said among those gunned down
were two women and two children.
Five others received gunshot wounds when the anti-Indian guerrillas
fired from automatic assault weapons, the police said, adding that
three of the survivors have been hospitalised in critical condition.
The overnight attack is the first major reported attack by Moslem
separatists against Kashmiri political workers since the state assembly
elections ended on September 30.
The pro-India Conference, which secured 57 of the 87 state assembly
seats during last month's vote, is poised to form the first government
in almost a decade in Indian-administered Kashmir.
Conference leader Farooq Abdullah is scheduled to form his government
on Tuesday to end six years of direct federal rule in Kashmir.
Moslem militants spearheading an anti-Indian rebellion in the region
had ordered people here not to vote during Kashmir's first assembly
elections since 1987.
A defence ministry spokesman, meanwhile, said army soldiers have killed
nine Moslem militants in a gun battle on Saturday night in the frontier
Kashsmiri district of Kupwara.
The fierce firefight erupted when an unknown number of militants fired
at an army patrol in a village, injuring a trooper, he said, and added
the soldiers ringed the rebels and shot dead nine armed guerrillas.
The official said four of those killed were foreign mercenaries and
added the patrol siezed a cache of arms and ammunition from the site of
the encounter in Kupwara, the last civilian outpost of frontier
Kashmir.
Also Saturday, two more separatists were shot by Indian troops in
Badgam, the spokesman said. Three civilians also died in separate
clashes in the past 24 hours in the strife-torn state.
