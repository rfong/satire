Netherlands Downs Switzerland 4-1 in Davis Cup 
The Netherlands nipped Switzerland 4-1 to enter the Davis Cup tennis
quarter-finals here on Sunday.
Richard Krajicek edged out Swiss debutante Lorenzo Manta 6-4, 6-4, 6-2
Sunday to give the Dutch an insurmountable 3-1 lead before Jan
Siemerink completed the victory with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Patrick Mohr.
Switzerland had a bad start on Friday when Marc Rosset, leading his
opening singles against Jacco Eltingh, retired from the match because
of a broken foot.
Jakob Hlasek kept Switzerland's hopes alive after beating Krajicek. But
without Rosset, Manta teamed with Hlasek instead in doubles and they
lost to the Dutch duo of Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis in four sets.
The Netherlands will face Germany, which beat Croatia in the
quarter-finals.
