Late/RB Tuesday/NNP NASA/NNP had/VBD considered/VBN holding/VBG a/DT sixth/JJ spacewalk/NN to/TO check/VB a/DT tracking/NN device/NN allowing/VBG the/DT telescope/NN to/TO orient/VB itself/PRP toward/IN a/DT particular/JJ celestial/JJ object/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN their/PRP$ last/JJ walk/NN ,/, during/IN which/WDT they/PRP reinforced/VBD parts/NNS of/IN Hubble/NNP 's/POS insulation/NN cover/NN ,/, astronauts/NNS Mark/NNP Lee/NNP and/CC Steve/NNP Smith/NNP tidied/VBD up/RP the/DT shuttle/NN 's/POS cargo/NN bay/NN ./.

Lee/NNP and/CC Smith/NNP patched/VBN up/RP some/DT tears/NNS in/IN the/DT outer/JJ covering/NN of/IN the/DT telescope/NN using/VBG wire/NN and/CC clips/NNS as/IN makeshift/JJ bandages/NNS ./.

``/`` You/PRP have/VBP done/VBN a/DT superb/JJ job/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD a/DT NASA/NNP official/NN back/RB in/IN Houston/NNP ,/, Texas/NNP ,/, after/IN the/DT two/CD astronauts/NNS returned/VBD to/TO the/DT shuttle/NN ending/VBG a/DT five/CD hour/NN ,/, 17/CD minute/NN spacewalk/NN ./.

When/WRB the/DT crew/NN of/IN the/DT Discovery/NNP first/RB began/VBD to/TO service/VB the/DT telescope/NN February/NNP 13/CD ,/, they/PRP noticed/VBD nicks/NNS and/CC tears/NNS in/IN its/PRP$ insulation/NN caused/VBN by/IN temperature/NN extremes/NNS in/IN its/PRP$ orbit/NN around/IN the/DT earth/NN ./.

Four/NNP improvised/VBD patches/NNS were/VBD applied/VBN during/IN the/DT fourth/JJ spacewalk/NN early/JJ Monday/NNP ,/, but/CC a/DT fifth/JJ outing/NN was/VBD deemed/VBN necessary/JJ to/TO complete/VB the/DT task/NN ,/, replacing/VBG insulation/NN covers/NNS to/TO some/DT of/IN the/DT Hubble/NNP 's/POS lower/JJR compartments/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD the/DT second/JJ time/NN the/DT Hubble/NNP telescope/NN was/VBD visited/VBN by/IN the/DT shuttle/NN after/IN it/PRP was/VBD placed/VBN in/IN orbit/NN ,/, also/RB by/IN the/DT Discovery/NNP ,/, in/IN late/JJ 1990/CD ./.

The/DT ground/NN crew/NN has/VBZ run/VBN tests/NNS and/CC verified/VBN that/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT instruments/NNS aboard/IN Hubble/NNP work/VBP ./.
