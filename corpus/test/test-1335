Sudan Peace Talks Kick off
The high-level Sudan peace negotiations, the first since 1994, kicked
off today with issues on self-determination right for the south and a
secular state expected to be high on the agenda.
Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka presided over the opening
ceremony for the talks and the ministerial meeting of the
Inter-Governmental Authority of Development (IGAD), the broker of the
Sudan talks.
The discussions will actually start behind-the-door tomorrow morning
and so far there has been no fixed date to end them.
"The talks have reached an important stage and both parties are now
expected to demonstrate good will and agree on a political settlement
that will enable the people of Sudan to re-direct their energies and
resources towards economic development," said Musyoka in his opening
speech.
He urged parties involved "to put aside any issues that might
jeopardize the success of the negotiations and instead, focus on
resolving their differences through dialogue for the good of the
Sudanese people."
The Sudanese parties should "be flexible and demonstrate understanding
and tolerance in the spirit of give and take to give peace a chance,"
he said.
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Taha headed the Khartoum delegation
while Salva Kiir, Chief of Staff of Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA) led the seven-member rebel team. The two sides have see-sawed in
southern Sudan for 14 years.
A delegate for the Sudanese government told Xinhua today he is not
optimistic about the results from the talks but refused to give more
details.
The set talks on Sudan peace can be successful as long as it starts
rounds of talks constantly for finding solutions to the 14-year-old
civil war in Sudan, said a Kenyan Foreign Ministry official asking
anonymity.
During an IGAD summit here in July, the Sudanese government accepted
the Declaration of Principles drafted by IGAD leaders in 1994 as the
basis for peace talks, making it possible to re-start the IGAD
mediation for ending the 14-year war in Sudan.
The document recognizes the right of self-determination for the
southern Sudan.
Sudan's civil war has claimed more than 1.3 million lives and made tens
of thousands displaced since 1983 when the SPLA rose to fight against
Islamic-backed Khartoum power for a secular state and more autonomy in
the Christian-dominated south.
