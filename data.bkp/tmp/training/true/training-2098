The/DT Nationalist/JJ Movement/NNP Party/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- MHP/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- leader/NN and/CC Deputy/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Develet/NNP Bahceli/NNP proposed/VBD MHP/NN deputy/NN and/CC Defense/NNP Minister/NNP Sabahattin/NNP Cakmakoglu/NNP or/CC Professor/NNP Kamil/NNP Turan/NNP ,/, dean/NN of/IN the/DT Law/NNP School/NNP in/IN Gazi/NNP University/NNP ./.

Mesut/NNP Yilmaz/NNP ,/, leader/NN of/IN the/DT Motherland/NNP Party/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- ANAP/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, however/RB ,/, refrained/VBD from/IN naming/VBG candidates/NNS during/IN the/DT meeting/NN and/CC reserved/VBD the/DT right/NN of/IN making/VBG an/DT assessment/NN of/IN the/DT issue/NN with/IN the/DT ANAP/NNP executives/NNS ./.

It/PRP was/VBD expected/VBN that/IN other/JJ names/NNS may/MD appear/VB on/IN the/DT agenda/NN of/IN Monday/NNP 's/POS meeting/NN ./.

After/IN talking/VBG with/IN his/PRP$ coalition/NN partners/NNS ,/, Ecevit/NNP will/MD consult/VB the/DT main/JJ opposition/NN Virtue/NNP Party/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- FP/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- leader/NN Recai/NNP Kutan/NNP and/CC True/NNP Path/NNP Party/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- DYP/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- leader/NN Tansu/NNP Ciller/NNP ./.

During/IN the/DT past/JJ meetings/NNS ,/, Ecevit/NNP asserted/VBD that/IN none/NN of/IN the/DT ruling/NN partners/NNS '/POS leaders/NNS should/MD be/VB nominated/VBN as/IN presidential/JJ candidates/NNS to/TO avoid/VB potentially/RB adverse/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT stability/NN of/IN the/DT coalition/NN ./.

Neither/CC Bahceli/NNP nor/CC Yilmaz/NNP reacted/VBD to/TO the/DT statement/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD a/DT clear/JJ indication/NN that/IN Ecevit/NNP was/VBD not/RB in/IN favor/NN of/IN presidency/NN for/IN Yilmaz/NNP ,/, who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN eyeing/VBG for/IN the/DT position/NN since/IN the/DT very/JJ beginning/NN of/IN his/PRP$ joining/NN in/IN the/DT coalition/NN government/NN as/IN the/DT junior/JJ partner/NN ./.

The/DT ANAP/NNP is/VBZ still/RB determined/VBN to/TO nominate/VB its/PRP$ leader/NN as/IN presidential/JJ candidate/NN ./.

One/CD ANAP/NNP executive/NN member/NN said/VBD that/IN ``/`` if/IN no/DT agreement/NN is/VBZ reached/VBN in/IN the/DT summit/NN ,/, we/PRP will/MD nominate/VB Yilmaz/NNP as/IN our/PRP$ candidate/NN ./. ''/''

He/PRP predicted/VBD that/IN Yilmaz/NNP would/MD be/VB the/DT most/RBS likely/JJ candidate/NN to/TO assume/VB office/NN ,/, adding/VBG that/IN those/DT candidates/NNS suggested/VBN by/IN Ecevit/NNP and/CC Bahceli/NNP will/MD not/RB even/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO garner/VB votes/NNS from/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ parties/NNS ./.

He/PRP said/VBD that/IN Akbulut/NNP ,/, also/RB from/IN ANAP/NNP ,/, is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ candidate/NN capable/JJ of/IN challenging/VBG Yilmaz/NNP for/IN presidency/NN ./.

The/DT speaker/NN has/VBZ reportedly/RB affirmed/VBN to/TO Yilmaz/NNP that/IN he/PRP will/MD run/VB for/IN presidency/NN ./.

Due/JJ to/TO the/DT souring/NN relations/NNS between/IN Yilmaz/NNP and/CC Akbulut/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ believed/VBN that/IN Akbulut/NNP will/MD not/RB hesitate/VB to/TO challenge/VB Yilmaz/NNP for/IN office/NN ,/, even/RB if/IN Yilmaz/NNP is/VBZ nominated/VBN as/IN a/DT presidential/JJ candidate/NN by/IN ANAP/NNP ./.

The/DT majority/NN of/IN deputies/NNS ,/, regardless/RB of/IN their/PRP$ party/NN background/NN ,/, are/VBP strongly/RB against/IN the/DT nomination/NN of/IN a/DT candidate/NN from/IN outside/IN the/DT parliament/NN ,/, therefore/RB they/PRP give/VBP practically/RB no/DT chance/NN to/TO either/DT Professor/NNP Haberal/NNP or/CC Professor/NNP Turan/NNP ./.

Although/IN numerous/JJ public/JJ polls/NNS showed/VBD that/IN Cem/NNP is/VBZ the/DT favorite/NN ,/, he/PRP lacks/VBZ support/NN in/IN parliament/NN ./.

Following/VBG a/DT briefing/NN on/IN foreign/JJ relations/NNS last/JJ week/NN in/IN parliament/NN ,/, Cem/NNP received/VBD staunch/JJ criticism/NN from/IN FP/NNP and/CC DYP/NNP deputies/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN from/IN ANAP/NNP deputy/NN Kamran/NNP Inan/NNP ,/, chairman/NN of/IN the/DT Parliamentary/NNP Foreign/NNP Affairs/NNPS Commission/NNP ./.

Cem/NNP 's/POS biggest/JJS handicap/NN is/VBZ his/PRP$ being/VBG a/DT member/NN of/IN a/DT left-wing/JJ political/JJ party/NN in/IN a/DT parliament/NN dominated/VBN by/IN right-wing/JJ ideals/NNS ./.

The/DT coalition/NN partner/NN MHP/NN simply/RB would/MD not/RB give/VB the/DT green/JJ light/NN to/TO Cem/NNP because/IN he/PRP is/VBZ a/DT leftist/JJ from/IN ANAP/NNP ./.

For/IN the/DT same/JJ reason/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ believed/VBN that/IN the/DT opposition/NN parties/NNS ,/, the/DT FP/NN and/CC DYP/NNP ,/, will/MD also/RB refrain/VB from/IN providing/VBG him/PRP any/DT support/NN ./.

Under/IN such/JJ circumstances/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ expected/VBN that/IN Cem/NNP will/MD not/RB receive/VB support/NN from/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ ANAP/NN either/RB ./.

Diplomatic/JJ circles/NNS here/RB said/VBD that/IN the/DT MHP/NNP Defense/NNP Minister/NNP Cakmakoglu/NNP might/MD get/VB some/DT support/NN from/IN all/PDT the/DT political/JJ parties/NNS other/JJ than/IN the/DT DYP/NN ,/, though/IN far/RB from/IN being/VBG adequate/JJ to/TO carry/VB him/PRP to/TO the/DT Presidential/NNP Palace/NNP ./.

Other/JJ candidates/NNS ,/, who/WP officially/RB nominated/VBD themselves/PRP for/IN the/DT presidency/NN ,/, are/VBP DSP/NNP deputy/NN Mail/NNP Buyukerman/NNP ,/, ANAP/NNP deputy/NN Agah/NNP Oktay/NNP Guner/NNP and/CC DSP/NNP deputy/NN Oguz/NNP Aygun/NNP ./.

These/DT candidates/NNS ,/, who/WP are/VBP devoid/JJ of/IN any/DT support/NN and/CC only/RB came/VBD forward/RP to/TO protest/VB the/DT attitude/NN adopted/VBN by/IN their/PRP$ leaders/NNS ,/, have/VBP no/DT chance/NN of/IN winning/VBG the/DT presidency/NN at/IN all/DT ,/, analysts/NNS said/VBD ./.
