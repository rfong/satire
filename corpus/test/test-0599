Supreme Court Ruling Upholds Sexual Predator Law 
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that states can keep violent sexual
predators locked up after they serve their prison sentences even if
they are not mentally ill.
In a decision that bodes well for the country's "Megan's laws," the
court has reversed a lower-court ruling that struck down Kansas's
Sexually Violent Predator Act as unconstitutional.
In effect, the act allowed the state to confine sexual predators to a
mental institution after they served sentences, but without any further
crimes or convictions.
The Kansas Supreme Court's law case could come this week.
