Call it a howling success. Or a frightfully successful season.
Retailers and manufacturers say Halloween is bigger commercially than
ever before. Sales of Halloween candy -- including roughly 10,000 tons
of candy corn --have grown rapidly in the last year, and costumes,
greeting cards, and especially home decorations are also much in
demand.
While appetites for boxes of chocolates at Valentine's Day and
chocolate bunnies and eggs at Easter remain strong, Halloween has
become the biggest holiday for candy. Sales of candy corn, miniature
candy bars and hard candy wrapped in seasonal colors should exceed $784
million at the wholesale level, the National Confection Association, a
trade group, says.
``If you are a candy maker, you live or die by Halloween,'' said Larry
Schafer, editor of Progressive Grocer magazine in Stamford, Conn.
Because Halloween goods are sold everywhere from department stores to
drugstores to gas stations, it is difficult to put a precise total on
holiday sales. But there is broad agreement that they will easily
exceed $1 billion.
After candy, costumes are -- pardon the expression -- the lifeblood of
Halloween, and business is booming, with sales this year expected to
exceed $300 million, helped along by the growing popularity of dressing
up among teen-agers and adults.
``We didn't know how good it was going to be,'' said Scott D. Emmerman,
national sales manager at Disguise Inc., a privately owned company in
the Long Island City area of Queens County. He said sales had doubled
from last year, helped by the company's licenses to make costumes of
the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, this year's blockbuster, and
characters from the movie ``The Lion King.'' Among this year's losers
are two types of dinosaurs: the cuddly Barney variety and the
terrifying creatures of the movie ``Jurassic Park''.
So pity Collegeville/Imagineering L.P., a large costume company in
Collegeville, Pa. Its president, Sam Cornish, says he passed when given
the chance to license the rights to the Power Rangers, whose teen-age,
karate-kicking characters are the stars of a children's television
show.
``I missed that one,'' Cornish said. ``It'll pass, and life goes on to
the next one.''
The biggest change this year, several retailers said, is the enormous
growth in in-home decorating for Halloween. Ghosts made of old sheets
and hand-carved jack-o'-lanterns seem to be taking a back seat in many
homes to goods bought in stores.
Decoration ``is huge,'' said Carolyn Brookter, a spokeswoman for Target
stores, which reported that sales of Halloween items were up 75 percent
from last year. She said the most popular item this year was an
illuminated ceramic pumpkin that sold for $7.99.
At Hallmark stores, the best sellers are strings of illuminated
eyeballs ($9.95), foam pumpkins ($14.95) and an audiocassette of scary
sounds ($1.95), said Adrienne S. Lallo, a spokeswoman for Hallmark
Cards Inc., which is based in Kansas City, Mo. She estimated that
nearly 35 million cards costing $29 million would be sent this
Halloween.
Amusement parks are another beneficiary of Halloween fever. More than a
dozen big parks around the nation and scores of smaller ones retool for
Halloween, adding ``re-themed'' rides and displays like ``Lair of the
Vampire'' at Knott's Berry Farm -- renamed ``Scary'' Farm for Halloween
-- in Buena Park, Calif., or ``The Execution'' at Six Flags Great
Adventure ``Fright Fest'' in Jackson, N.J.
Amusement parks typically used to go dark after Labor Day, as their
young workers and many customers returned to school. But Halloween
themes have provided a way to stay open on fall weekends.
``Fright Fest,'' held at all seven Six Flags parks, has given the
company at least 70 additional days of operation, said Eileen L.
Harrell, a spokeswoman for the parks, which are owned by Time Warner
Inc. That could add $25 million or more to Six Flags' revenue of $500
million, said Jeffrey Logsdon, an entertainment analyst for the Seidler
Companies in Los Angeles.
Knott's Berry Farm, which is privately owned, is typically sold out for
its ``Halloween Haunt,'' which was expanded to 12 October nights this
year and costs $30 a person at the gate. The park turns on giant fog
machines to increase the spookiness and employs 1,000 temporary workers
who appear as aliens, werewolves and other monsters.

Many mail-order houses are also doing a brisk Halloween business.
This year Swiss Colony, for example, added two Halloween treats --
pumpkin cheese cake for $16.50 and apple pumpkin tortes for $11.95 --
to its traditional offerings of cheeses and sausages in its holiday
edition mailed in September. The response was surprisingly strong, said
John D. Baumann, marketing vice president for the company, based in
Monroe, Wis., and more Halloween items are likely to be offered next
year.
The Popcorn Factory, based in Lake Forest, Ill., sold out of its $15
goblin tins, said Nancy P. Hensel, the marketing vice president. ``It
gives us a little kick before it gets hot and heavy for the Christmas
season,'' she said.
Indeed, Halloween sales have been so strong that some merchants are
hoping the sales are a barometer for the important year-end holiday
season.
``We are incredibly busy, and it's much earlier than last year,'' said
David C. Hochberg, a spokesman for the Lillian Vernon Corp., a
mail-order company based in Virginia Beach, Va. ``We're hitting order
numbers now that we normally see in November.''
But Cynthia Cohen Turk, a retailing consultant in Miami, played down
the overall impact. ``Halloween's a cheap event,'' she said. ``It's not
the impact of Valentine's Day,'' when sentiment is often expressed with
expensive gifts.
Other experts agreed, noting that much more important barometers for
retailing were back-to-school sales, which were disappointingly
moderate this year, and overall retail sales. October's results will be
available in two weeks.
