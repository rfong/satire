``/`` On/IN several/JJ occasions/NNS ,/, I/PRP walked/VBD into/IN King/NNP 's/POS room/NN only/RB to/TO find/VB him/PRP dressed/VBN as/IN a/DT woman/NN ./. ''/''

Letterman/NNP leapt/NNP in/IN ,/, ``/`` So/RB King/WRB is/VBZ a/DT Queen/NNP then/RB ?/. ''/''

A/DT ruffled/NNP Bernanke/NNP replied/VBD ,/, ``/`` He/PRP enjoys/VBZ cross-dressing/JJ ./.

I/PRP have/VBP no/DT idea/NN whether/IN he/PRP 's/VBZ gay/JJ ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP Mervyn/NNP recently/RB married/VBN ./. ''/''

This/DT morning/NN the/DT City/NNP is/VBZ agog/VBG with/IN the/DT news/NN ./.

60-year-old/NNP King/NNP has/VBZ responded/VBN to/TO Bernanke/NNP 's/POS allegations/NNS with/IN the/DT words/NNS ,/, ``/`` No/DT Comment/NN !/. ''/''

Meanwhile/RB ,/, the/DT story/NN is/VBZ unraveling/VBG quickly/RB ./.

His/PRP$ predecessor/NN ,/, Sir/NNP `/`` Eddie/NNP '/'' George/NNP ,/, commented/VBD ,/, ``/`` On/IN several/JJ occasions/NNS ,/, King/NNP arrived/VBD at/IN meetings/NNS with/IN mascara/NN around/IN his/PRP$ eyes/NNS but/CC I/PRP presumed/VBD this/DT was/VBD due/JJ to/TO his/PRP$ previous/JJ evening/NN 's/POS amateur/JJ theatrics/NNS ./.

But/CC BOE/NNP Monetary/NNP Policy/NNP Committee/NNP Member/NNP ,/, Charles/NNP Bean/NNP ,/, made/VBD a/DT damming/JJ statement/NN ./.

``/`` For/IN some/DT months/NNS King/NNP has/VBZ attended/VBN Policy/NN meetings/NNS wearing/VBG women/NNS 's/POS clothing/NN ./.

This/DT has/VBZ upset/VBN a/DT number/NN of/IN Committee/NNP members/NNS ./.

So/IN much/RB so/RB ,/, that/DT Sir/NNP John/NNP Gieve/NNP and/CC Rachel/NNP Lomax/NNP have/VBP recently/RB resigned/VBN ./. ''/''

Another/DT Monetary/NNP Policy/NNP Committee/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- MPC/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- associate/JJ and/CC good/JJ friend/NN ,/, Professor/NNP David/NNP Blanchflower/NNP ,/, said/VBD ,/, ``/`` It/PRP goes/VBZ back/RP to/TO the/DT days/NNS when/WRB Mervyn/NNP was/VBD a/DT student/NN at/IN King/NNP 's/POS College/NNP ,/, Cambridge/NNP ./.

He/PRP cultivated/VBZ a/DT fascination/NN for/IN women/NNS 's/POS clothing/NN then/RB ./.

``/`` Until/IN recently/RB ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN able/JJ to/TO control/VB these/DT tendencies/NNS but/CC the/DT `/`` Northern/NNP Rock/NNP '/'' debacle/NN ,/, along/IN with/IN the/DT growing/VBG UK/NNP inflationary/JJ uncertainties/NNS ,/, has/VBZ triggered/VBN his/PRP$ deviancy/NN again/RB ./.

Some/DT will/MD turn/VB to/TO alcohol/NN or/CC drugs/NNS ;/: others/NNS to/TO excessive/JJ sex/NN or/CC exercise/NN ./.

Cross-dressing/NN is/VBZ King/NNP 's/POS way/NN of/IN dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT pressure/NN he/PRP 's/VBZ under/JJ ./.

Perhaps/RB ,/, being/VBG a/DT woman/NN ,/, makes/VBZ him/PRP feel/VBP more/RBR relaxed/RB and/CC in/IN control/NN ./. ''/''

Not/RB since/RB FBI/NNP chief/NN ,/, J/NNP Edgar/NNP Hoover/NNP ,/, has/VBZ the/DT world/NN been/VBN rocked/VBN by/IN such/PDT a/DT scandal/NN ./.

Bean/NNP continued/VBD ,/, ``/`` At/IN MPC/NN meetings/NNS Mervyn/NNP will/MD wear/VB large/JJ fake/JJ breasts/NNS covered/VBN by/IN a/DT long/JJ stripy/NN dress/NN ./.
