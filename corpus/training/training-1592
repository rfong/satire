U.N. Proposes Voluntary Financing for New Bosnia Force 
Facing U.S. pressure, the United Nations is proposing that about half
the cost of the rapid reaction force it is sending to Bosnia is funded
by voluntary contributions, diplomats said Thursday.
The United States has balked at the high expense of the new force,
which is expected to cost some dlrs 260 million through November.
U.N. officials told troop contributing nations on Thursday that they
would ask for voluntary contributions to cover dlrs 140 million of the
costs of the mission, a diplomat said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The proposal is expected to be presented to a budgetary advisory
committee Friday. If accepted, the measure must be approved by a
general assembly committee.
The Security Council approved sending the rapid reaction force to
Bosnia last month to beef up its faltering U.N. mission.
The force will be equipped with mortars and artillery and will be
responsible for protecting peacekeepers and ensuring that they can
carry out their mission.
The United States pays about one-third of the U.N. peacekeeping budget
and U.S. congressional leaders have complained about the high costs of
the new mission.
Diplomats said Thursday that 5,300 troops would be paid for with
mandatory contributions, while the budget for 7,150 soldiers would be
met by voluntary contributions.
