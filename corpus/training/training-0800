Playoff failures catch up with Murray 
Bryan Murray, haunted by building great teams that were playoff
failures, was fired here Friday as general manager of the National
Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings.
Murray and his assistant, Doug MacLean, were sacked after Detroit led
the Western Conference with a 46-30 record with eight draws. The Red
Wings were ousted by bottom seed San Jose in the first-round of
post-season play.
"We both agreed it was time for him to move on," Detroit owner Mike
Ilitch said. "There was no animosity involved in this decision."
Murray had served as coach and general manager for three years after
guiding Washington for nine seasons. But in both cities he was hounded
by an inability to win in the playoffs. Only once did his clubs advance
past the second round.
Murray's career coaching record was 467-337 with 112 draws, with an
added playoff mark of 34-44.
