Exhibit Displays Hundreds of Secret World War II Documents 
Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery unveiled the original secret 1939
Molotov-Ribbentrop protocols to the Russian public for the first time
Thursday, coinciding with Russia's biggest military holiday.
The protocols, which the Soviet government kept secret for decades, are
part of an exhibit of nearly 400 previously secret documents from World
War II.
Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister
Joachim von Ribbentrop signed the protocols in 1939, dividing Eastern
Europe between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.
The museum also displayed the original map dividing Poland, signed by
Ribbentrop and Soviet leader Josef Stalin.
The exhibit includes the original copy of Nazi Germany's statement of
unconditional surrender, signed by the chief of staff of Germany's
armed forces, Col. Gen. Alfred Jodl, on May 7, 1945.
The Tretyakov also displayed military decrees ordering the Red Army
into Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in 1941 -- where they remained until
the last Russian troops withdrew last summer.
Documents from the Allies' conferences at Yalta, Tehran and Pottsdam
are also on display.
A spokeswoman for the Tretyakov said the exhibit features only a small
part of Russia's wartime archives, and that the museum plans to
continue bringing such documents to the public.
President Boris Yeltsin's chief of staff, Sergei Filatov, said at
Thursday's opening, ``It is of great importance that these archives are
being gradually declassified,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
Filatov also said that it is time for Russia to ``pay for'' its long
silence about the protocols.
Defenders of the Fatherland Day, formerly Red Army Day, was marked
Thursday by celebrations and protests across the country.
