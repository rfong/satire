IRA says London bus bomb victim was one of its own 
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) said one of its men was the one killed
by a bomb on a London bus Sunday night, RTE Irish state radio said
Wednesday.
The Irish Times earlier identified the dead man as Edward O'Brien, 21,
of the Dublin area.
In London, Scotland Yard refused to confirm or deny O'Brien's identity,
which the paper attributed to Irish police.
But O'Brien's family, in a statement through their lawyer, said they
"unreservedly condemned" the attack.
The O'Brien family expressed "deep sorrow and sympathy" for the eight
people injured in the blast, the third bomb incident in London since
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) ended its 17-month ceasefire on
February 9.
The statement said the family wanted no paramilitary involvement "in
any way, shape or form, good, bad or indifferent" at their son's
funeral.
The lawyer said Miley O'Brien and his wife Margo had been shocked to
discover their son's involvement in the London bombing, adding that the
couple "abhorred violence and terrorism" and wanted nothing to do with
paramilitaries.
An IRA bomb in east London's Canary Wharf February 9 killed two and
injured 40, and a small device was found and disarmed in a London phone
booth last Thursday after an IRA coded warning.
