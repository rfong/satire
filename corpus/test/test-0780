Australia's Qantas to beat cost target by 100 million dollars 
Qantas Airways Ltd. said here Wednesday it would exceed its 1996-97
cost cutting target of 330 million Australian dollars (260 million US)
by 100 million dollars.
"We will exceed that figure by 100 million dollars," chairman Gary
Pemberton told reporters after the company's annual general meeting.
Asked if the cost savings, over the financial year to July, would
involve contracting out or franchising some of the airline's
operations, he said: "I don't dismiss anything at all.
"I wouldn't see them having a major impact in the short term on the
sort of cost savings we've been talking about."
The savings would be achieved across a range of areas, including the
effective utilisation of assets, he said, dismissing suggestions that
Qantas was lagging behind rival airline Ansett Australia, which has
recently introduced an electronic ticketing system.
In his address to shareholders, Pemberton voiced the airline's concerns
over the Australian government's move to open up landing rights to
foreign carriers.
"The competition it generates, particularly from foreign carriers with
less stringent financial objectives is intense," the chairman said.
Over the long term, the result would reduce Qantas' capacity to invest
in new and developing markets, he warned.
He told the AGM that Qantas was not opposed to competition in the
airline industry, but at some stage Canberra would have to decide "how
many more free kicks they are prepared to give our opposition".
