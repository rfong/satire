Obama's aircraft makes emergency landing after Hillary discovered at controls!
Presidential candidate Barack Hussein Obama had to make an emergency
landing on his way to a campaign stop in North Carolina.  The Boeing 737
campaign chartered JetBreeze aircraft was acting 'strangely' according to
FAA flight controls who watched the plane doing barrel rolls, dive bombing
practice runs, and flying inverted for long periods of time as it departed
Los Angeles on Monday.
Said FAA official Ben Morgan, "We thought it was an F-15 fighter jet at
first, but the IFF beacon was broadcasting it as the Obama flight!"
Once on the ground, aiport officials in St. Louis discovered
ex-Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at the controls dressed as a
JetBreeze pilot! She had alcohol on her breath, and was carrying hand
written notes on 'how to fly a 737'!
Clinton was remanded into the custody of her husband Bill Clinton, and
will make her court appearance in August.
