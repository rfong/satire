Celebration of Marconi's transatlantic radio transmission plus 100 
Canada celebrated Wednesday the 100th anniversary of the first
trans-Atlantic radio transmission, sent from England and received by
Guglielmo Marconi.
Marconi's grandson keyed the radio signal in Cornwall, England. It was
received on a set similar to the one used by Marconi in St. John's,
eastern Newfoundland at 12:13 pm (1613 GMT), said Newfoundland
government spokeswoman Catharina Kennedy.
The signal was sent on a transmitter operated by Royal Navy engineers
and received by members of the US and Canadian armies.
A thousand people attended the ceremony, officiated by Canada's
Governor General Adrienne Clarkson and the Prime Minister of
Newfoundland, Roger Grimes.
The anniversary was celebrated earlier and 2,000 miles (3,200
kilometers) away in Poldhu, Cornwall, in south-western England, from
which the three dots of the Morse code for "S" were broadcast.
In 1907, the first wireless trans-Atlantic service was opened to the
public.
A museum honoring Marconi was inaugurated on the spot in Poldhu. The
Italian physicist and inventor shared the Nobel prize in physics with
German physicist Ferdinand Braun.
