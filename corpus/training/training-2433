Saudi Arabia picks up summit bill 
Saudi Arabia is picking up most of the 50-million dollar bill for the
Islamic summit here rather than staging the event and having to host
Iraq and other "undesirables," delegates said Monday.
The last summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Dakar
in 1991 picked Saudi Arabia as the next host.
But the Saudi authorities told the Jeddah-based OIC that it did not
want to hold the gathering as it refused to receive "delegations that
they judge undesirable, particular the Iraqi one," a delegate said.
Saudi Arabia was the target of Iraqi Scud missiles as it served as a
base for the allied coalition which drove Baghdad's forces from Kuwait
in the Gulf war of January-February 1991. It has staunchly opposed the
lifting of UN sanctions against President Saddam Hussein's government.
The summit, which opens Tuesday, is bringing together 25 heads of state
and 2,500 delegates and journalists.
