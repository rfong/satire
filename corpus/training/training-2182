Mexican Foreign Trade Bank Opens Office in Japan 
Mexican Foreign Trade National Bank (Bancomext) opened a commercial
office in Osaka, Japan, as part of its strategy to expand markets for
Mexican products, a report from the bank said Wednesday.
It said the opening of the office would favor business relations
between Mexico and Japan and would encourage awareness of the presence
of Mexican companies in Japanese markets.
Commercial exchanges between the two countries reached 35.240 billion
U.S. dollars, with an annual growth of 7.57 percent during the past
five years, it said.
Mexican exports to Japan increased to 2.395 billion dollars last year,
a 44.96 percent raise over 1999, accounting for 1.43 percent of its
total exports.
Osaka is one of the main production centers in Japan and also one of
the seven most important economic zones in the world, with a per capita
income of 33,505 dollars.
