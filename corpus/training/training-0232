Macedonian government to reimburse bankruptcy victims 
The Macedonian government will release 20 million marks (12 million
dollars) to partially reimburse victims of the TAT bankruptcy scandal,
Finance Minister Taki Fiti said Thursday.
IMF representatives helped the government set the figure in order to
protect the country's economic policy and the stability of its
currency, the denar.
Nearly 30,000 people lost their savings after the collapse of the TAT
investment firm, based in Bitola in the south of the former Yugoslav
republic. Some 28 million dollars were lost according to official
government estimates.
Unofficial reports put the number closer to 60 million dollars.
Parliament will soon vote on a special law that would pay out to savers
in the failed firm 500 marks per month during the first six months.
The government would use that period to try and sell of TAT assets,
which should bring in an additional 27 million marks and make a full
payback possible.
TAT owner Sonja Nikolvska and the deputy governor of the Macedonian
National Bank Tome Nenovski were arrested following the collapse of the
finance house in March.
Also implicated was Jorgo Sundovski, former minister for construction,
environment and town planning. He resigned after the press accused his
wife of having withdrawn 100,000 marks from TAT after its fall.
