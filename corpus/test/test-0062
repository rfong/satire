What Is A Nation? Chechnya Revives U.N. 
The war in the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya is crystalizing
two issues that have been debated only sporadically here despite the
rise of ethnic separatism around the world: How inviolate is national
sovereignty? And what should the limits of self-determination be?
Those questions have been raised at the United Nations since mid-1992,
when Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali published ``Agenda for
Peace,'' a report written for the Security Council at a time when hopes
were still high and horizons still seemed broadened because of the cold
war's end.
In those days, Boutros-Ghali wrote ``that an opportunity has been
regained to achieve the great objectives of the Charter.''
He included not only peacekeeping but peacemaking, or interposing force
between warring parties whether or not they agreed. He also emphasized
the promotion of human rights and higher living standards.
A few years later, nearly 150 wars or skirmishes are in progress in
which thousands of people are dying -- more civilians than soldiers by
most reckonings -- and hundreds of thousands are becoming refugees.
With more than 100 of those battles taking place within countries
rather than between them, the United Nations must find a way to
intervene to save both lives and states, diplomats say. But to do so,
the organization will have to use new tools and concepts. There have
been some significant moves in that direction.
The General Assembly approved a sweeping resolution Friday calling on
the secretary general to take steps to promote democratization and
strengthen the election process worldwide.
It also asked the newly appointed high commissioner for human rights,
Jose Ayala Lasso of Ecuador, to support education on human rights.
Madeleine Albright, the chief American delegate, welcomed the Assembly
vote as a means to expand the scope of the United Nations in promoting
political rights, one way to dampen the discontent that often leads to
rebellion. But these are long-term goals.
For the moment, the major nations represented here, and the United
Nations as an organization, remain committed to guarding national
integrity above the rights of peoples.
The case of the former Yugoslavia -- in particular Bosnia-Herzegovina
-- is both an exception to that concept and, to many, an instance of
the terrible price paid when recognition is quickly extended to
entities that might not be viable as countries.
``If you look at the Security Council resolutions in the last two or
three years, you will find that in almost every crisis we insist --
sometimes apparently out of the blue -- on preserving the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the state,'' said Emilio Cardenas, the
chief delegate from Argentina, which holds one of the 10 rotating seats
on the 15-member Council.
``We went as far recently in making that point about Iraq, where we
believe that you should protect the Shias and Kurds without breaking
the national identity -- providing that the country respects
diversity,'' he said.
Cardenas and others say there is a perceptible shift away from almost
automatically embracing self-determination for minorities.
Instead the Council is looking toward minority problems and
secessionist movements as political, economic and human rights issues
in which the United Nations may have some standing. That trend was
reflected in the General Assembly vote on democratization and
human-rights education.
``We talk less and less about self-determination, because of the fear
of secession,'' Cardenas said in an interview. ``We talk more and more
about the need to protect minorities inside the state.''
