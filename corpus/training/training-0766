Eurocorps German commander hands over to Frenchman 
The German commander of the European force Eurocorps, General Helmut
Willmann, handed over his command to French General Pierre Forterre,
55, here on Wednesday.
"I am leaving in the certainty I have left behind me a great
operational multinational unit," Willmann, aged 55, said at Eurocorps
headquarters here in the presence of the chiefs of staff of the member
states of the unit -- Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Spain .
Willmann, first commander of the unit created by France and Germany,
took over on October 1, 1993 and subsequently became German armed
forces chief of staff.
Command of the unit rotates every two years among the member countries.
Eurocorps consists of a multinational staff of 350 officers based here
in command of 50,000 troops.
Its mission is to take part in joint defence operations for the allies
and humanitarian relief and peacekeeping operations for NATO, the
Western European Union (WEU), the United Nations, or the Organisation
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but has so far seen no
action.
Willmann said Forterre's task over the next two years would be to
establish a light rapid action force of between 2,000 and 4,000 men for
humanitarian action and evacuating refugees. The force would stage its
first exercises this year on the Canary islands.
Willmann said a rapid action mechanised force of between 15,000 and
18,000 men with heavy equipment would also be set up and the force
would hold its first manoeuvres in June next year, also in Spain.
