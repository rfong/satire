Orange County Sells Risky Securities And Cuts Its Loss
Officials of Orange County, Calif., announced Wednesday the sale of all
risky securities in the county's ill-fated investment pool, leaving it
with a loss of $1.69 billion rather than the $2.02 billion predicted
earlier.
``The hemorraghing has stopped,'' said Thomas Hayes, the former state
treasurer who was hired by the county to sell the portfolio. ``The pool
now has short-term liquid securities and is safe. The pool will
continue as an investment entity.''
In a rare bit of good news, county officials said that gains from the
sale of securities in the investment fund, along with accounting
adjustments, led to the revised number.
This means that, on average, the local governments and others that
invested in the fund are now expected to lose 22.3 percent of their
money, not 27.2 percent, as initially expected.
Heavy borrowing by the Orange County investment pool to finance a risky
bet on falling interest rates led to the bankruptcy, on Dec. 6, of one
of the nation's most affluent counties.
On filing for bankruptcy, Hayes, aided by Salomon Brothers, began to
dispose of the portfolio. They traded risky securities for safer ones,
while trying to make an accurate accounting of all the money in the
fund.
The task was necessary so that all investors in the fund -- including
Orange County itself and 186 other local government entities -- would
have an accurate sense of how much money they lost. The selling also
stopped the fund from losing even more money from a change in interest
rates.
The reorganization of the portfolio was completed ahead of the 90-day
timetable.
Currently, there is $5.88 billion left in the pool, some $5.13 billion
in marketable securities and $540 million in cash. Of the $20 billion
once held by the investment pool, about $13 billion was borrowed.
The amount of cash put into the investment fund by Orange County and
186 municipalities in the area is now estimated at $7.57 billion -- not
the $7.42 billion initially cited by officials.
Hayes said that part of the improvement over initial loss estimates
came after Arthur Andersen accountants, piecing together fund
documents, found some securities and investments that had not
previously been accounted for.
These included $310 million in cash, $150 million more in pool
investments along with $92 million in previously unidentified
securities.
In addition, gains from the sale of securities in the pool exceeded
initial estimates by $36 million. It was not disclosed how much profit
and fee income Salomon Brothers received for selling the wide variety
of risky securities.
