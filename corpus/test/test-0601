Sacchi gamble pays off as Italy back on track
The biggest gamble of Arrigo Sacchi's career paid off spectacularly as
Italy put their World Cup campaign back on track with a battling win
over Norway here on Thursday.
Reduced to ten men in the middle of the first half when goalkeeper
Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off for a professional foul, Italy went
ahead through Dino Baggio's 69th minute header then held out heroically
against a late Norwegian onslaught.
In the closing minutes the exhausted Italians, who lost their defensive
lynchpin Franco Baresi with a twisted knee only minutes into the second
half, were often playing with only eight men as Dino Baggio and Paolo
Maldini went down with injuries.
But somehow they held out to vindicate Sacchi's brave decision to pull
off his best player, Roberto Baggio, to allow Luca Marchegiani to
replace Pagliuca in goal.
"I thought the coach had put the wrong number up," Baggio, who left the
field shaking his head, admitted. "It's not a pleasure sitting on the
bench but the most important thing is the result and if my sitting out
achieves that then I'm happy."
After losing to Ireland on Saturday, the Italians had to avoid defeat
at all costs and Sacchi decided Pierluigi Casiraghi's ability to hold
the ball up and relieve the pressure on the defence was a better bet
than Baggio's creativity.
"We needed ten payers on the field who could run and run and Baggio is
carrying a tendon injury," Sacchi said. "Whatever I decide for Baggio
is for his own good and I think he will have a great game against
Mexico.
"We suffered a lot for this victory," the Italian coach added after
surveying his battered troops. Baresi, who was replaced by Luigi
Apolloni, could be out of the tournament but Maldini's ankle knock
seemed less serious.
"I'm very happy with the spirit we showed to win a game that we
absolutely could not lose," Sacchi added. "But we are not in the second
round yet. We still need a point against Mexico."
