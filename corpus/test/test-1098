Southeastern Chinese Province Encouraging Mountain Area Development 
China's Fujian Province has developed policies recently to stimulate
the economy in mountainous areas.
A provincial government official says that Fujian will allocate funds
for infrastructure, improve the investment environment, develop
education and science and technology, and support pillar industries in
mountainous areas.
Mountains and hilly areas cover over 80 percent of Fujian and economic
development in these areas has lagged far behind that of coastal parts
of the province.
With the help of these policies, by the year 2000, the GDP in these
parts of Fujian is expected to be over eight times that of 1980.
