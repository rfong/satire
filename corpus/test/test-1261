Alternative World Social Forum opens with peace march
Tens of thousands of globalization opponents from social movements
worldwide Thursday opened their alternative to the World Economic Forum
in New York with a massive peace march.
Local police commander Ilson Pinto de Oliveira estimated as many as
30,000 people joined the march to open the World Social Forum, a crowd
slightly smaller than the 40,000 people expected by organizers.
The six-day conference features 700 workshops, 100 seminars and 28
plenary assemblies of more than 13,000 delegates for the 50,000
participants from 150 countries who are gathered at the sprawling
complex of Catholic University of Rio Grand%+d{ Sul.
"The importance of this forum is not simply a matter of how many people
participate, but the enormous number of important topics to be
discussed here," said Brazilian Workers' Party leader and presidential
hopeful Luiz Inacio "Lula" da Silva.
While participants at the World Economic Forum discuss "how to
accumulate wealth," the World Social Forum will focus on "how to better
distribute it," he said.
Security for the gathering of 3,000 world economic and business leaders
"was so expensive, a small Swiss town could not afford it," da Silva
said, alluding to the forum's change of venue this year from Davos,
Switzerland, to New York.
The conference in Porto Alegre, by contrast, is marked by plurality and
openness, he said.
Among session topics at the Brazilian forum are the problem of debt in
southern hemisphere countries, corporate taxation, #zm wral diversity,
water as a public commodity, food security and the role of women in
globalization.
"Our objective is to discuss how humans can live with dignity," da
Silva said.
Among the accredited participants in the forum are two members of
Batasuna, known as the political wing of the Basque separatist group
ETA, they told AFP, despite efforts by organizers to not admit
delegates with links to armed militias.
Among those not invited was World Bank President James Wolfensohn. His
request to speak at the forum was denied because the principles the
World Bank defends are incompatible with those of the forum, said
Sergio Haddad of the Brazilian Association of Non-Governmental
Organizations.
Wolfensohn was told he could be included as a member of the audience,
but organizers cautioned against it as "it would not be advisable" in
an environment where the "atmosphere would not be favorable," Haddad
said.
A World Bank spokeswoman later said Wolfensohn never intended to attend
the World Social Forum in Brazil and was not refused an invitation to
speak.
Spokeswoman Caroline Anstey said Wolfensohn had planned instead to
attend the World Economic Forum in New York.
"The president never had any intention to go to Porto Alegre. He is in
Holland today and in New York tomorrow and there was no room on his
schedule anyway," Anstey said.
Thursday began with an opening salvo by the disenfranchised, when a
group of 300 homeless families occupied a 14-story abandoned building
owned by Sul American insurance in downtown Porto Alegre.
"We want to protest the lack of public policy for housing, the lack of
real urban reform," said Juliana Gonzales, director of the National
Movement for the Struggle for Housing, using the neglected building
filled with dead birds and excrement and draped with the group's red
flags as a symbol of neglect.
Meanwhile thousands of young people made camp in a park adjacent to the
state capital buildings. Organizers said 10,000 people from 52
countries had signed up to use the free facilities there.
"We believe another world is possible and we are here to make our
contribution," said Angela de Avila, 16, seeking a place to pitch her
tent after arriving onsite.
