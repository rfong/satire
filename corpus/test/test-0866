Cowboys defensive coordinator Butch Davis met late last night with
University of Miami athletic director Paul Dee, sources said, and the
Philadelphia Eagles want to speak to Davis early next week.
Meanwhile, two sources confirmed ``Star-Telegram'' reports that the
Cowboys are laying groundwork for Davis' departure by preparing to
promote linebackers coach Jim Eddy and by initiating contract talks
with the unsigned assistants.
Davis returned home yesterday from his Thursday rendezvous in Los
Angeles with Raiders boss Al Davis to find two urgent messages: one,
from Miami, which sent Dee to Dallas to meet with Davis; and two, from
the Eagles, who have received permission from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones
to speak to the coach.
Should Davis leave, a team source said, scouting director Larry
Lacewell could handle the defensive coordinator's job, ``and so could
some others in-house. But promoting Jim Eddy is the smoothest
transition. It means continuity and it means having someone who's done
the job before.''
Eddy was the Houston Oilers' coordinator from 1990-93 before coming to
the Cowboys. Some of the assistants not under contract are scheduled to
meet for negotiating sessions with Jones early next week.
``Barry Switzer's recommendation is that we retain all of our
assistants, and I completely agree,'' Jones said.
The recent Senior Bowl week in Mobile, Ala. -- annually a coaches'
job-hunting convention -- has resulted in gossip about other Cowboys
coaches moving. But offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese still hasn't
been called by the Rams, and Jones said he is confident the staff
``will be intact for 1995, as much as possible.''
That would seem to exclude Davis. Sources said his meeting with the
Raiders -- a session orchestrated, by the way, by Jones, who respects
Butch Davis' work and admires Al Davis' -- did not include contract
talk. But they did discuss a possible second meeting. And their first
session was as serious as it was secretive.
How serious? So serious that Al Davis ``picked (Butch Davis') brain
about everything,'' a source said. ``Draft plans, practice schedules,
philosophy, staff makeup, everything. Either Al is serious or he's
trying to steal all the Cowboys' tricks.''
The ``stealing'' theory is unlikely, given the Al Davis-Jerry Jones
relationship. Jones has said he confers with Davis more than weekly. So
Davis has access to ``Cowboys' tricks'' without any facade of a
coaching change.
How secretive? So secretive that current Raiders coach Art Shell didn't
learn of the meeting until yesterday, when he arrived at work. Shell
left the Raiders' facility yesterday with his job intact. But he also
left having learned second hand about Davis' clandestine interview and
Thursday's hiring of Joe Bugel as ``senior assistant.''
A source said Butch Davis and Art Shell had the same amount of input
into the Bugel hiring: none.
``I don't know anything about it,'' Bugel said. ``My role is the only
thing I know about. Where is Art Shell in all of this? ... This is news
to me. Big news to me.''
Added a source close to the Raiders: ``It seems underhanded. But Art is
a Raider. He will be taken care of.''
Butch Davis' situation with the University of Miami, where he once
coached under Jimmy Johnson, is less clear.
Davis expressed some frustration earlier this week while waiting for
contact from school administrators. Some in the Davis camp are
attempting to steer him away from Miami, partly because of potential
NCAA probation there and partly because of his red-hot candidacy for a
National Football League job.
But the Hurricanes' booster club has thrown support and money -- a
guaranteed three-year, $2.1 million package -- Davis' way. And a source
said Dee, while traveling, made a stopover in Dallas late last night to
meet with Davis.
Eagles insiders continue to maintain their top choice is San Francisco
aide Mike Shanahan, who cannot be contacted until after the 49ers play
the Super Bowl. That puts Davis, who could interview early next week,
on what one source has called ``a backup list.'' That's the same status
Davis holds with the Denver Broncos, who have talked of Davis but covet
Shanahan.
