News Analysis: Thailand's Policy Switched to Microeconomic Reforms
The Thai cabinet Tuesday approved the latest quarterly economic review,
better known as the fifth letter of intent, agreed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). The letter shows that the Thai
government has switched its focus from macroeconomic framework to
microeconomic reforms.
Experts said as the country's macroeconomic framework has achieved a
degree of stability, focus has turned to efforts to streamline
regulations to make the system transparent and accountable.
The first year of the Thailand economic program under the IMF's
17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar rescue package witnessed changes in fiscal and
monetary policy, exchange rate, net international reserves, interest
rates, economic growth rate, external accounts and balance of payments.
Despite all the criticism of the bitter pills prescribed by the IMF in
the previous four letters of intent, Thailand has come through its
worst nightmares to achieve a relatively stable economic framework.
The baht has been stable at 41 to 42 baht against the U.S. dollar with
net international reserves expected to hit 26-28 billion U.S. dollars
by the end of this year.
Only a year ago, Thailand's net reserves were depleted by the baht
defense, falling to 800 million dollars and triggering a shock wave
throughout Asia.
Short-term interest rates, which hit 24 percent in December 1997, have
fallen to 10-12 percent.
In May this year, IMF and Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda
changed their stance at the fiscal-tightening policy, allowing fiscal
deficit spending to act as an economic stimulus.
With all these achievements, experts say that Thailand now enters into
the reconstruction phase, where microeconomic framework will come into
full play.
In the latest letter of intent, Thailand and IMF laid great emphasis on
financial reforms, corporate debt restructuring, social security and
market opening.
Analysts said that the economic recovery will not be seen if Thailand
does not follow up with implementation of the financial and economic
reform as outlined in the IMF program.
Halting the economic decline and the rising non-performing loans in the
banking system requires a strong microeconomic framework to put the
banks back in business and clean up their balance sheets.
The comprehensive financial reform package announced by the government
on August 14 is aimed at addressing the problems through government
intervention and mergers, privatization of state-controlled banks,
raising public funds for banks' recapitalization and developing private
asset management companies.
Moreover, the government is eliminating impediments and strengthening
the broader incentive framework for restructuring. This will include
the elimination of tax disincentives for debt restructuring, and the
revision of Bank of Thailand regulations for loan classification and
collateral appraisal.
The government has further taken on the banking reform by creating a
Financial Sector Restructuring Advisory Committee to ensure the
successful implementation of the banking reform package.
Despite all the government's macro- and micro-economic efforts to bring
the country's economy back on foot, Thailand's economic recovery also
hinges on external factors, particularly Japan's and the region's
economic performance.
In the fifth letter of intent, the government forecast that the
country's economy will bottom out early next year after a 7-percent
contraction in 1998.
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai hinted that IMF and his government expect
the economy possibly expanding at a flat zero percent or a slight 0.5
percent.
However, this forecast will mean nothing, as forecast in the previous
four letters of intent, if the currency and banking crisis continues in
Japan and other emerging markets.
