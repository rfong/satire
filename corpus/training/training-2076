Girl Germs Plague School Playground
School girls are required to wear special masks to prevent spread of
girl germs.
ON THE SCHOOLGROUNDS-- I knew the playground was a dangerous place to
venture towards, but I went outside anyways, despite knowing the threat
of going outdoors. I wanted to play in the schoolyard and I wasn't
going to let some silly childhood fear ruin my potential for fun.
Traditionally, the monkey bars were boy territory. But I had heard
reports that girls had been spotted nearby. I wondered momentarily if
the area was truly safe, free from the invisible contagions these young
female carriers where known to transmit.
I know it shouldn't be necessary for a six-year-old to wear latex
gloves, a face mask, and carry around packets of mint-scented
anti-bacterial handwash. The cellophane shoe covers seemed
unnecessarily excessive. But girl-germs were everywhere, and of course,
with girl-germs there were no returns.
