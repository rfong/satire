Burundi to Quit Tanzanian Port for Trading: Report 
Burundi plans to stop using the Dar es Salaam port as transit point for
imports because of disagreement with Tanzania over bilateral tariff
rates arrangement, Tanzania's independent Guardian newspaper reported
on Thursday.
Goods imported by Burundian traders will later be channeled through
seaports in Kenya, South Africa and lake ports in Zambia, the newspaper
quoted officials in Bujumbura as saying.
Burundian Minister for Transport, Post and Telecommunications Cyprien
Mbonigaba has already visited Zambia and signed an agreement with his
Zambian counterpart on using Mpulungu port on Lake Tanganyika for
transporting its imports, the newspaper said.
The Burundian government intends to use Mpulungu port as one way of
benefiting from the Southern Corridor, a trading route connecting
Burundi with South Africa via Zambia.
Under the existing tariff rates, goods, which are transported through
Dar es Salaam port to Burundi via Tanzania's Kigoma port by the lake,
become too expensive by over 150 percent of their actual prices.
Most of Burundi's trade currently goes through Tanzania.
