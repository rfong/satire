Ecuador in State of High Tension: President Mahuad 
Ecuador is experiencing a "Very High" social tension due to economic
problems, President Jamil Mahuad said here on Wednesday.
The president was quoted by the newspaper "El Commercio" as saying that
the social tension currently swiping Ecuador is sparked not only by a
nation-wide Taxi strike but also by worsening economic situation as the
country's inflation rate soared to 50 percent.
However, he is optimistic about better economic and social conditions
in the near future because the country is holding negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund.
For the third consecutive day, Ecuador has been hit by a strike of taxi
drivers, who are protesting against the rising fuel price and the
government's poor economic performance.
President Mahuad announced a 13 percent gasoline price hike earlier to
trim a bloated budget deficit.
