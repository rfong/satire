Pakistan's Synthetic Fabric Exports Decline 
Pakistan's exports of synthetic fabrics declined by 14 percent in July
and 13.7 percent in August this year from proceeding months, official
sources said here today.
Exports of synthetic fabrics in July and August 1997 stood at 50
million U.S. dollars and 43 million dollars respectively as compared to
57 million dollars in June, said the sources.
As the government has announced a drastic cut of up to 50 percent in
duty drawbacks from September 20, 1997, there are apprehensions of a
further drop in the exports, said the sources.
The sources said it is necessary that any change in policy matters
particularly involving financial cuts should be allowed to take effect
at least 12 weeks onward.
This interim period would enable exporters to adjust their export
planning accordingly and fulfill their earlier commitments smoothly,
the sources said.
