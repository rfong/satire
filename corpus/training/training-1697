Baiul sets sights on Nagano Olympics 
Olympic champion Oksana Baiul of Ukraine hopes to compete in the 1998
Nagano Games by reverting to amateur status next year.
Lyudmila Mikhailovskaya, President of the Ukrainian Figure Skating
Federation, said Baiul could compete at the 1996 world championships.
She has to comply with International Skating Union rules requiring all
skaters to announce by April, 1995, their intention to compete as
amateurs.
"Oksana is serious about coming back to the amateurs and wants to
defend her Olympic title in Nagano in 1998," Mikhailovskaya said.
"It is important for us (Ukraine) that Baiul will have a good showing
at the World Championships in 1996 and 1997. With good results in 1997
we can send three female skaters to Nagano."
Baiul, 17, skated in some professional events in North America after
winning her gold medal at the Lillehammer Olympics. She has not
competed this season in any ISU sanctioned events because of a serious
knee injury.
But she has been working on a new programme with her coach Galina
Zmievskaya in the United States.
