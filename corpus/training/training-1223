Five new commercial banks due to open in 1996 
Five new commercial banks will be set up in Lebanon in 1996 to help
fund the production sector and financial firms will also be created to
attract capital from abroad, central governor Riad Salame said.
Salame told AFP the banks will be financed by Arab and Lebanese
nationals and aim to "set up partnerships with small and medium
industries, namely those dealing with tourism, or grant them medium and
long term loans."
New financial firms will also be created, in addition to the 16
companies already operating in Beirut, to help attract foreign
investments, he added.
According to banking sources, three Lebanese commercial banks and one
headed by a Lebanese-Kuwaiti group are expected to obtain licences
soon.
There are 82 commercial banks operating in Lebanon.
"In 1995 these banks granted credits worth 6.5 billion dollars to the
private sector and five billion dollars to the state through
subscriptions to treasury bonds," Salame said.
The deposits of Lebanese, Arab and European commercial banks, including
those set up through Lebanese and foreign capital, increased by 17
percent in 1995 to 15 billion dollars while credit went up by 31
percent to 11.5 billion dollars, according to Makram Sader of the
Association of Lebanese Banks.
These banks have mainly financed commercial activity in Lebanon, which
imports 90 percent of its consumer goods and equipment.
Salame said meanwhile that commercial banks increased by nearly 40
percent their personal capital in 1995 for a total of 800 million
dollars and attained a solvency rate of 8-10 percent.
