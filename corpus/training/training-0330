Gulf War veterans seek damages for malady 
Twenty-six Gulf War veterans have filed a class-action lawsuit seeking
compensation for disabilities from what they claim was exposure to
biological and chemical weapons during the conflict in 1991.
The lawsuit filed Monday in Texas seeks one billion dollars in damages
from 11 companies involved in manufacturing chemicals and materials
alleged to be "unreasonably dangerous."
David Bickham, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the companies were
negligent in allowing "an outlaw country like Iraq" to obtain the
materials.
Scores of Gulf War veterans have complained of symptoms such as speech
and motor impairments, memory loss and other ailments.
The US government has not recognized the alleged "Gulf War Symdrome,"
saying the veterans suffer from a variety of different ailments.
Named in the lawsuit are: Abb Lummus Crest Inc., Abb Lummus Crest North
America, Alcolac Inc., Alcolac International Inc., Interchem Inc.,
Rhone-Poulenc Inc., Posi-Seal International Inc., Fisher Controls
International Inc., Bechtel Group Inc., Bechtel Corp and American Type
Culture Collection Inc.
