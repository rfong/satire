Netherlands Donates $6.7m to Uganda's Primary 
The Netherlands has donated 6.7 billion Uganda Shillings (some 6.7
million U.S. Dollars) to support Uganda's primary education program, a
local report said today.
An agreement to this effect has been signed by Uganda Finance Minister
Joash Mayanja-Nkangi and the Netherlands Embassy Charge d'Affairs
Saskia De Lang on behalf of their respective countries.
The fund will be used in accordance with the agreement to train
untrained teachers, management training for headmasters, and promoting
support of the local communities for the education of their children.
The Ugandan government is enhancing education throughout the country.
In 1997, some 28 million U.S. Dollars were allocated to primary
education in the country.
More than 5 million children have registered for the primary education
program.
