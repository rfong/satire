China Intensifying Poverty-Relief Work 
With less than two years left to achieve the goal of eradicating
poverty, China is intensifying poverty-relief efforts among poor rural
residents in the central and western regions, today's China Daily
reported.
Government officials admitted that, despite years of efforts which have
raised millions of the rural poor out of poverty, large numbers of poor
people still remain to be provided with adequate food and clothing.
The number of poor people stood at about 50 million at the end of 1997,
with no more up-to-date figures available. The poverty level in China
is set at annual per capita income below 640 yuan ( 77 US dollars), the
paper said.
The Chinese Government has pledged to basically solve the food and
clothing problems of poor rural residents by the end of 2000.
"Half of the remaining poor rural residents are now living in abject
poverty, lacking the basic conditions for working and living decently,"
Zhang Lei, deputy director of the State Council's Leading Group Office
on Poverty Alleviation and Development, said yesterday.
Zhang's remarks came at a workshop on women and poverty held in Beijing
yesterday. He said the government has urged determined implementation
of the poverty-alleviation responsibility system that holds leading
Party and government officials in localities accountable for the work.
In those counties which have substantially solved the problems of a
shortage of food and clothing, local governments should help farmers by
guiding them towards growing commercial crops and developing
competitive businesses, thus saving them from plunging back into
destitution, he said.
