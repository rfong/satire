Leaders To Seek Regional Force To Keep Tense Angolan Peace 
As an uneasy calm spread across battlefields Monday, southern African
leaders weighed sending troops to Angola as part of a U.N. force that
is supposed to anchor a day-old treaty and end 19 years of war.
Ten people were killed and 87 were wounded in the capital as residents
shot guns to celebrate the treaty signed Sunday in Lusaka, Zambia,
hospitals said.
But neither Angolan state radio nor the rebel station Vorgan reported
fighting and both broadcast appeals for peace and reconciliation.
``Today, all Angolans can begin again to live in peace, thanks to the
Lusaka accords,'' government radio said. ``A new era has begun and new
path must be followed.''
UNITA's station urged Angolans to show ``will to forget the past.''
Repeating a ritual that has twice failed to end the war, Foreign
Minister Venancio de Moura and UNITA Secretary-General Gen. Eugenio
Manuvakola signed the pact, capping a year of U.N.-brokered
negotiations.
The treaty was to lead to a permanent cease-fire starting Tuesday and a
power-sharing deal for the country, devastated by a war that began on
the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975.
``The accord has begun on a promising foot,'' said Col. Armindo Bravo
Rosa, a Defense Ministry spokesman. ``The army is calm and maintaining
vigilance.''
He reported UNITA troop movements around the country but ``no great
change on the ground.''
Aid workers in the northern city of Uige, which both sides claim to
control, said UNITA soldiers were patrolling tense streets but there
was no fighting.
Nigerian Gen. Chris Garuba, the U.N. chief military observer, reported
``significant progress'' at talks between government and rebel military
leaders in Lusaka on implementing Tuesday's formal truce.
``I do think the cease-fire will be in force and will be observed,'' he
said.
But Manuvakola, who led UNITA's delegation, refused to reveal details
about rebel troops and weapons to government negotiators ``until the
fighting stops.''
U.N. observers are to go to trouble spots once Tuesday's truce begins,
but U.N. peacekeepers are not expected until the cease-fire is seen to
be holding.
U.N. sources said so far they had received commitments for only 15
percent of the 7,000 planned peacekeepers.
Zimbabwe planned to convene a meeting of regional foreign ministers to
debate contributing to the U.N. force.
South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said his country, Zimbabwe
and Zambia had received U.N. requests for soldiers but stressed the
troops would only go once it was clear the cease-fire was holding.
``We are not going there to fight, and that would apply to all
countries in the region,'' he said.
Celebratory shooting killed 10 people and wounded 87, mainly in
Luanda's miserable shanty towns.
Sunday's signing ceremony was tinged with bitterness. Rebel leader
Jonas Savimbi, who was supposed to sign with President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, failed to show up.
He claimed he was unable to leave Angola because of government attacks
and delegated Manuvakola to sign at the last minute. When Savimbi did
not appear, dos Santos also delegated his minister to sign.
The official Jornal de Angola said Manuvakola met privately with dos
Santos after Sunday's ceremony, apparently to discuss a meeting between
the president and Savimbi.
The newspaper said such a meeting could take place within 10 days at an
as yet undetermined site.
Twice before, in 1989 and 1991, dos Santos and Savimbi shook hands
after signing treaties intended to halt the war which has killed a
half-million Angolans and left millions more threatened by disease and
starvation.
Fighting resumed both times, most recently in 1992 when UNITA -- the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- lost multiparty
elections and returned to war.
