Russia, IMF reach accord in principle on granting of huge loan 
The Russian government and the IMF have reached an "accord in
principle" on the granting of a multibillion dollar IMF loan provided
certain conditions are met, Russian Finance Minister Vladimir Panskov
told the ITAR-TASS news agency Thursday.
Panskov was speaking during a break in negotiations with International
Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus on the loan, expected to total at
least nine billion dollars spread over three years.
The Russian central bank has said it hopes to get 12 billion dollars
from the IMF, which would make it the second largest credit in the
IMF's history after that granted to Mexico.
