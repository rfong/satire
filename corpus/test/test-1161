Chirac Reaffirms Hostility Toward Brutal Methods 
French President Jacques Chirac today reaffirmed his hostility toward
any "brutal" method to force Iraq to cooperate with the United Nations
in armaments, such as military action and economic sanctions.
"France is not, in principle, favorable to brutal methods, in
particular the resort to force or sanctions," Agence France-Presse
quoted Chirac as saying in London where he is attending the
Franco-British summit.
Chirac said that on the other hand, Iraq should respect its engagements
with the United Nations in disarmament inspections.
"In the particular case of Iraq, it is evident that Iraq should, first
and above all, respect the engagements it has taken," he said.
Meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry today refused to confirm or deny
a report that Iraqi Vice Prime Minister Tarek Aziz will visit Paris
next week, before going to New York to hold talks with United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan on the on-going crisis between Iraq and
the United States.
The United Nations Security Council will meet Monday to discuss a
report to be submitted by a U.N. mission in Baghdad this week.
The present crisis came after Iraq ordered the expulsion of all
Americans from the special commission of the United Nations in charge
of supervising disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM) two weeks ago, in
retaliation against a U.S.-proposed U.N. resolution which hardened
sanctions against Iraq.
