Zambian President Promises His People Cultural 
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba Saturday promised his countrymen
cultural rights.
He told thousands of people attending this year's royal N'cwala
traditional ceremony of the Ngoni of eastern Zambia that his government
is committed to providing the necessary environment to enable all
Zambians to fully enjoy their cultural rights, the Zambia News Agency
quoted him as saying.
He told the ceremony in Chipata, eastern province that the government
attaches great importance to the preservation, promotion and
development of Zambia's diverse cultural wealth because culture is an
important aspect of national development.
Because of the importance and great value his government attaches to
ceremonies such as the N'cwala, for the first time in the history of
Zambia, a separate provision has been introduced in this year's budget
specifically to provide grants to traditional ceremonies, he said.
Chiluba commended paramount chief Mpezeni IV for his leadership in
encouraging his subjects to appreciate and enjoy their cultural wealth.
He said N'cwala is one of Zambia's richest traditional ceremonies and
that is why traditional rulers are the custodians of this country's
heritage.
The House of Chiefs is likely to begin working by the middle of this
year, he said.
The president said a constitutional provision has been put in place for
the establishment of the house of chiefs with powers to initiate a
legislative framework on matters that related to customary issues.
Chiluba said the government fully recognizes the important role chiefs
should play in the country's development because no economic growth
could take place in communities in this country without their full
involvement.
