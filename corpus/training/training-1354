High doses of vitamin A cause birth defects: study 
High doses of vitamin A in pregnant women increase the risk of birth
defects such as cleft palate and malformations of the head and heart,
according to a study released Friday.
Data gathered from more than 22,000 pregnant women found that one of
every 60 babies born to women taking more than 10,000 IU of vitamin A
daily -- or about four times the recommended intake -- was adversely
affected by the vitamin, the study said.
The study, conducted from 1984-87 by a team of rearchers at Boston
University Medical School, is to be published in the November 23 issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine.
"Preparations of vitamin A available in food stores and health stores
contain as much as 25,000 IU of vitamin A in a single capsule," it
said. "This level ... is a potentially teratogenic (birth
defect-inducing) dose."
It warned, further, that "by the time a woman realizes she is pregnant,
it may be too late to reduce high vitamin A intake enough to avoid
adverse effects."
Because vitamin A, like vitamin D, is stored in body fat, excessive
vitamin A intake even before conception may also lead to birth defects,
the study said.
Among adverse effects associated with excessive vitamin A intake during
pregnancy are cleft lip, cleft palate, major heart defects, and
hydrocephalus -- in which excessive brain and spinal fluids cause the
brain to atrophy, it said.
