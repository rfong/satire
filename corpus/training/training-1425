Feature: Uygur Teacher Says, 'I Believe I Can Fly' (2)
To reduce the cost, he tried to make all the parts himself except for
the engine. In his spare time, he often went to the salvage station to
find scrap steel and iron. Using this material, he welded the body of
the plane and built the wings.
It took Abdulla 11 years to finish "Turpan No.1" and cost him 15,000
yuan and all his spare time. The plane weighs 190 kilograms and is 6.5
meters long with a wing span of 11.7 meters.
Last summer, Abdulla made his maiden flight. Although the plane only
flew about 5 meters at a height of one meter, Abdulla said that his
heart was throbbing with excitement.
Just before July 1, 1997, when China resumed the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, Abdulla decided to contribute his plane to
the country.
On June 23 of last year, "Turpan No.1" was sent to Beijing by train
where it was on display in the National Space and Aviation Museum.
Abdulla said that the speed of "Turpan No.2" could reach 80 to 120
kilometers per hour at a height of 3,000 meters, but he dared not climb
higher than 100 meters due to his amateurish pilot skills.
At first, Abdulla's wife, Ayixam, and his elderly mother worried that
it was too dangerous to fly. But they did not succeed in persuading him
to give up his dream.
Abdulla's son, Ahat, 10, is also interested in planes. His small planes
made of plastic foam can be found scattered under the grape trellis.
"My planes are simple and crude," Abdulla said. "But as long as they
can arouse children's interest in science, I'm very much satisfied."
