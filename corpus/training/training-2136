Armstrong's Team Facing Judicial Inquiry 
French judicial sources released on Thursday that the Paris prosecutor
has opened a judicial investigation over US Postal, the team of
two-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong, about doping
allegation.
The prosecutor's office said a probe was opened "against persons
unknown" for violation of laws prohibiting the use of illegal drugs,
incitement to use doping products and violation of laws about dangerous
substances.
The inquiry comes following an anonymous tip-off which led to the
opening on October 18 of a preliminary inquiry.
Following a month of investigations those working on the case believe
there is enough evidence to proceed with a full-blown investigation
which will be headed up by Parisian judge Sophie- Helene Chateau.
US Postal insists that the team has an attitude of "zero tolerance"
towards doping and Armstrong has always strenuously denied taking any
banned substances.
