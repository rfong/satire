Boy's Wal-Mart Telescope Shames Hubble
James McBride, a 14 year old amateur astronomer from Dumas, Texas, has
captured a stunning image of a four-nebula cluster he has nicknamed "Face
of God." The Texas panhandle resident captured the image using nothing more
than a disposable 35mm camera and a telescope his grandfather bought for
him at Wal-Mart.
On a clear night this past July, James and his girlfriend, Dana
Pearson, were camping in the hills north of Dumas. James scanned the
skies with his new 4 inch Meade telescope for hours before catching the
a glimpse of what he called "a face looking back at me." Girlfriend
Dana admitted that she was getting bored with James' celestial
obsession, but now that he has his picture in USA Today, she's "glad
she didn't break up with him!"
Nasa officials were a bit embarrassed at James' discovery, considering
that they released "The Eye of God" in May 2003. The NASA photo,
captured by the multi-million dollar Hubble Telescope, showed only the
right "eye"; a single nebula of the four-nebula cluster. "We were
looking deep into space; trillions of miles away. We never thought
about pulling back to see the bigger picture," admitted Kenneth
Darling, directory of the Hubble Team. "We were shocked when some kid
from a little town in Texas came up with a shot of the whole face."
Since the discovery, James has been approached by several national
newspapers, The Discovery Channel, CNN, and even FoxNews. "I'm just all
excited about all of this," James told reporters. "I knew I had
something big, but didn't have no idea until I got the prints back from
Wal-Mart. I was so excited, I forgot to pull out the naked pictures I
took of Dana. Damn! Mama was pissed!" Dana refused to comment, but her
blushing smile corroborated James' story, without a doubt.
Douglas McBride, James' grandfather told reporters that he bought the
telescope with the hope of sparking James' desire to learn. "James
hadn't been doing too well in school and," Douglas explained, "I was
worried that the boy was getting mixed up with drugs. Damned if I
didn't think he was on drugs when he told me he had a picture of God's
face." Douglas went on the express his pride for his grandson, and his
hope that this discovery would help him get into a good college.
When asked if he wants to be an astronomer when he grows up, James
responded, "I'm not sure. To be honest, I just thought the telescope
was a good excuse to get Dana to go camping with me. But now, I don't
know. I think it's pretty cool. Do astronomers make a lot of money?"
