Eritrea Denies Ethiopian Battle Victory Claims 
A senior Eritrean government official in Asmara Monday dismissed
Ethiopian battle victory claims as "a complete sham, " according to an
Eritrean News Agency report reaching here.
Ethiopia issued a statement Sunday saying that 45,000 Eritrean troops
had been put out of action and 77 tanks destroyed in fighting along
three fronts from February 23 to March 26.
The Eritrean official said "these figures are completely forged. They
are claiming false victories citing battles they once denied," the
report said.
"Ethiopia was denying that any fighting had taken place around Tsorona
(on the central front along the border) and only skirmishes had
occurred there, now they contend that they killed and wounded 9,000
Eritreans and destroyed 36 tanks," the official charged.
"In Badme, we reported that during the fighting in February, we had
destroyed and captured 41 enemy tanks, now they have repackaged that
assessment as their own report," noted the official.
The official believed that Ethiopia only released this statement in the
wake of international verification of the massive losses it suffered in
recent fighting.
Ever since the two Horn of Africa neighbors renewed their border
fighting in February this year, the two sides have been exchanging
accusations with each other.
