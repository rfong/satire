US dollar stable in wait-and-see market 
The US dollar held steady against other major currencies here early
Friday as the market awaited the outcome of a European Union summit on
the proposed single currency.
Operators were glued to the summit that opened Friday in Dublin, aimed
at reaching a stability accord, said Stephen Gallagher, an executive at
Societe Generale in New York. The pact would be the last technical
hurdle to a single EU currency.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 369.50 dollars an ounce, up 50 cents from its
Thursday closing.
"Everybody's watching the Dublin summit, fearing they will not come out
with a stability pact," said Gallagher. "But people are saying that
they will come out with some pact."
Around 11 a.m. (1600 GMT), Spanish officials in Dublin said that
European finance ministers had agreed on a budgetary stability pact for
single currency participants.
Half an hour earlier in New York, the dollar in New York was quoted as
trading at 1.5407 German marks compared with 1.5405 late Thursday, and
at 113.55 Japanese yen (113.15).
The greenback also was trading at 5.2050 French francs (5.2135), 1.3110
Swiss francs (unchanged), and at 0.6022 pound sterling (0.6033).
