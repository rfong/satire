UNSC starts public debate on Jenin mission
The UN Security Council began a public debate Friday on the Israeli army's
assault on the Palestinian refugee camp at Jenin and on Israel's rejection
of a UN fact-finding mission.
In addition to the 15 council members, 20 other speakers were initially
scheduled to take part in the debate which the council president,
Kishore Mahbubani, ambassador of Singapore to the United Nations, said
would likely continue late into the night.
The first speaker, Nasser Al-Kidwa, the Palestinian observer to the UN,
accused Israel of "blackmailing" the world body by raising repeated
objections to the composition and mandate of the fact-finding team.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan disbanded the team on Thursday without
its even having set foot in the Middle East.
"Israel's refusal to cooperate with the mission proves that its defence
forces committed unspeakable atrocities against our people in the Jenin
refugee camp," Al-Kidwa said.
There was no doubt that the Israeli army committed war crimes and
possibly a massacre, he said.
It had fired rockets from helicopter gunships into densely populated
areas; it had used armoured bulldozers to demolish houses, sometimes
with people inside; it had blocked relief teams from entering the camp
for 11 days; and it had used human beings as shields, he charged.
"All these details have been established and constitute crimes of war,"
Al-Kidwa continued.
It remained to determine whether there was a massacre of civilians in
the camp, he said.
