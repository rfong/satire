CIA: Syria Harboring More Than 15 Million Known Arabs
In an alarming report released Monday by the Central Intelligence Agency,
Syria may be harboring upwards of 15 million known Arabs within its
borders.

Suspected Arabs move freely through a Damascus marketplace.
"Reliable intelligence collected by our agency indicates that Syria has
conspired to lend physical and economic support to a massive number of
people belonging to this group," CIA director George J. Tenet said.
"The shocking truth is, there are nearly as many Arabs in Syria as
there are people in New York and Los Angeles combined. In fact, Syrians
openly refer to their nation as the Syrian Arab Republic, despite
knowing full well America's opinion on these matters."
Explaining the CIA's methods of gathering data on the rogue ethnicity's
presence in Syria, Tenet said it relied on a combination of satellite
imagery, computer-system infiltration, reports from Syrian covert
operatives, intercepted radio and television transmissions, and The
World Almanac And Book Of Facts 2003.
"It's practically an open secret these days," Tenet said. "Syrian
television brazenly shows Arabs in military uniforms carrying guns, or
delivering political speeches to other members of the group. Walk into
any house of worship in the country, and you'll see people reading the
Koran and bowing their heads in prayer toward Mecca. It's almost like
they're daring the United States to get involved."
"Disturbingly, more than 90 percent of these Arabs have been linked to
the practice of 'Islam'--a defiantly non-Western system of faith whose
core principles are embraced by none other than Osama bin Laden and
Saddam Hussein," Tenet added. "If this is true, and we do consider this
information to be correct in all particulars, then this is troubling at
best."
President Bush, Tenet said, has been aware of Syria's ties to known
Arab political and religious figures since the earliest planning stages
of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Tenet assured reporters that all possible
diplomatic avenues of resolving the situation were being aggressively
pursued.
"We have informed [Syrian President] Bashar al-Assad of the presence of
Arabs in his country and have offered any aid necessary to bring this
situation under control," Tenet said. "I am confident that a resolution
to this crisis can be achieved without resorting to military action."
This is not the first time Syria has been linked to Arabs. Israel found
the Golan Heights heavily populated by Arabs when it annexed the region
from Syria during 1967's Arab-Israeli War. Arabs have historically held
many influential posts in the Syrian government, and the CIA claims to
have data indicating that wealthy Arab businessmen control the greater
part of Syria's economy.
The CIA report prompted concern from many Americans.
"I'm not surprised," said Wayne Early, an Atlanta-area mortgage broker.
"I suspect they're all over that part of the world. First, the
government linked them to Sept. 11, then Afghanistan, and then Iraq. It
makes you wonder who's next."
"The more I learn about Arabs, the less I like them," said Carol
Schecter of Norfolk, VA. "Beirut, Teheran, Baghdad... everyplace
there's trouble, they're there, and now we've found them in Syria. I
just hope they don't hurt the regular Syrians."
Tenet assured citizens that he is committed to resolving the crisis.
"We don't want to cause any undue panic, but now that the Arabs are
there, we're going to have to deal with them," Tenet said.
"Unfortunately, they're not just going to go away by themselves."
