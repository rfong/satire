Animals Become Friendship Ambassadors 
Three pairs of rare animals including red kangaroos and red guenon
monkeys from the Tennoji Zoo in Osaka, Shanghai's sister city, were
presented to the Shanghai Zoo recently.
The two cities have exchanged animals every two years since 1974 when
the Tennoji Zoo presented a pair of sea lions and two pairs of penguins
to Shanghai. About 100 pairs of animals of 30 different species have
been swapped during the last 24 years.
Many of the animals from Osaka have become accustomed to their new
environment and have bred in the Shanghai Zoo. There are now 12 family
members of the two giraffes who settled in Shanghai in 1979. And the
penguins presented by Osaka last year have just had three babies.
Pandas, Chinese alligators and other animals given by the Shanghai Zoo
are also warmly welcomed by the people of Osaka.
At the exchange ceremony, officials of the two zoos expressed their
hope that these mutual donations will continue to promote cooperation
in animal research and protection.
