Brazilian PM Ernesto de Morais Condemns US Genocide, Hypocrisy
In a speech to the Brazilian Parliament today, Prime Minister Ernesto
de Morais condemned what he termed as the "massive genocide that has
been going on in the USA since the 1970's."
He stated that "The USA went into Iraq partially because of the
genocide that Hussein had perpetrated in that country in his regime.
President Bush, along with all Republican Presidential Candidates with
the sole exception of Representative Ron Paul, supported and continue
to support the Iraq invasion.
"This, however, is blatant hypocrisy, considering that they are
ignoring the massive genocide of the unborn that has occurred under the
guise of 'abortion'.
"For this reason, I am asking the Parliament to mobilize our troops
immediately, and request that our intelligence research the most
effective way to put a stop to the senseless slaughter that is being
conducted even as we speak."
Parliament later voted unanimously in favor of the action, and
Brazilian aircraft carriers and their support craft are currently
moving towards Florida.
Although most leaders condemned Brazil's decision, Brazil did get some
support from the Swedish PM, who stated that "The hypocrisy of the USA
has gone on long enough.
"They have been attacking and threatening other countries because of
their genocides and weapons of mass destructions, while ignoring the
simple fact that their doctors have murdered many more innocent lives
then the likes of Hitler, Saddam Hussein, and other mass murderers."
The White House press secretary said that at this time, the President
didn't have any comment, but was watching the developments as they take
place.
