Confident that history was on his side, Culture Minister Jacques Toubon
braved mockery and abuse this spring when he promoted a law requiring
that 3,000 English words widely used in France be replaced by newly
created French equivalents.
After all, as far back as 1539, Francois I proclaimed French to be the
official language of the land. In 1635, the Academie Francaise was
created by Cardinal Richelieu to define the rules of French. In 1803,
Napoleon clamped down on regional languages and dialects in the name of
uniting France.
So Toubon was following a noble tradition. Indeed, would not Francois I
or Richelieu or Napoleon also have acted to prevent French from
becoming a hybrid barely distinguishable from ``Franglais,'' that
bizarre language born of British and American attempts to speak French?
But, alas, the minister overlooked some of his history. France may
claim to possess the global language of love, culture and civilization,
but it also boasts that it is the cradle of human rights. And late last
month, the precedent that suddenly counted was the 1789 Declaration of
the Rights of Man.
The country's Constitutional Council ruled that the government was
violating the freedom of expression enshrined in this declaration by
trying to impose the language law on individuals. The government can
police itself, the Council said, but it had no right to tell the French
people what words to use.
One Council official, Olivier Schrameck, gave an example. ``The sports
minister, commenting on the achievements of the French soccer team,
will have to use the expression `jet de coin,' but the sports
commentators will be free to use the word `corner,' '' he explained.
But the court went even further, deriding the general notion of ``an
official terminology'' and noting that, ``like any living language,''
French is evolving naturally by tapping a variety of sources, including
expressions used in regional languages, popular slang and foreign
words.
The government was stunned. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said that,
had the Constitutional Council existed in 1538, it might well have
overruled Francois I.
The culture minister, who has already earned the nickname of ``Mr.
All-Good,'' the English for ``M. Toubon,'' said the Council had misread
his law.
In a lengthy article in Le Monde defending his initiative, Toubon waxed
poetic about what the French language means to the French -- ``it is
their primary capital, the symbol of their dignity, the passageway to
integration, the diapason of a universal culture, a common heritage,
part of the French dream.''
And all this, he implied, was threatened by the steady infiltration of
English words and phrases, ranging from street slang to business and
technical terminology, into the French language.
In fact, a good many English words have already been accepted by the
Academie Francaise, but Toubon hoped that his decree would force most
to be replaced by French words.
Now, however, while government officials will have to follow the new
rules by, for example, saying ``heures de grande ecoute'' when they
mean prime time, language freedom has been restored in the areas where
English words are most often adopted -- on radio and television,
advertising, business and science.
Predictably, the advertising industry was delighted by the Council's
ruling. ``The law was nationalist and unjust, and it killed freedom and
creativity,'' said Jacques Seguela, a prominent advertising executive.
``They were trying to establish a linguistic McCarthyism.''
Maurice Levy, president of Publicis, another advertising agency, was
less drastic in tone. He said he fought the Toubon law but did not
consider it ``a national catastrophe.'' The government should defend
French not through legislation, he said, but by promoting it more
vigorously abroad.
Appropriately, it was Maurice Druon, a member of the Academie
Francaise, who offered a final word on the issue. He approved of
Toubon's general initiative but criticized many details of the law.
In the end, he said, the government would be best served by leaving
protection of the language to the one body created for that purpose --
the Academie Francaise itself.
