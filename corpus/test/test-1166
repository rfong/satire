Marine Environment Well Protected in Hong Kong
Addressing the opening ceremony, an environment official said the
marine reserve, together with two existing marine parks in the
northeast of the New Territory, brings Hong Kong into a new era of
marine conservation.
Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands Bowen Leung said the
marine parks and reserve, though a new concept introduced to Hong Kong
in the early 1990s, have shown their research and educational
potential.
Cape D'Aguilar is a place full of special marine creatures, according
to Leung. In a coral rock pool there 12 species of corals have been
found, with one indigenous to the area. A rare species of marine eel
grass has been discovered at the Yan Chau Tong Marine Park.
The official said continuous efforts will be made to select new sites
for more marine parks or reserves in the future.
