Bridegroom/NNP Costa/NNP thwarts/VBZ Ferrero/NNP to/TO take/VB French/JJ Open/NNP title/NN by/IN Dave/NNP James/NNP Spain/NNP 's/POS Albert/NNP Costa/NNP won/VBD the/DT first/JJ Grand/NNP Slam/NNP title/NN of/IN his/PRP$ career/NN and/CC gave/VBD himself/PRP a/DT 735,000-dollar/JJ wedding/NN present/NN when/WRB he/PRP shrugged/VBD off/RP battling/VBG countryman/NNP Juan/NNP Carlos/NNP Ferrero/NNP to/TO win/VB the/DT French/JJ Open/NNP title/NN here/RB on/IN Sunday/NNP ./.

The/DT 20th/JJ seeded/NN Costa/NNP 's/NNP 6-1/CD ,/, 6-0/CD ,/, 4-6/CD ,/, 6-3/CD win/VBP was/VBD completed/VBN in/IN two/CD hours/NNS ,/, 30/CD minutes/NNS against/IN an/DT opponent/NN who/WP ,/, in/IN the/DT early/JJ stages/NNS ,/, was/VBD still/RB suffering/VBG with/IN an/DT ankle/JJ injury/NN that/WDT almost/RB put/VBD him/PRP out/RP of/IN the/DT tournament/NN before/IN he/PRP played/VBD the/DT second/JJ round/NN ./.

The/DT victory/NN gave/VBD the/DT 26-year-old/JJ Costa/NNP a/DT timely/JJ 735,000-dollar/JJ winner/NN 's/POS cheque/NN just/RB five/CD days/NNS before/IN he/PRP is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO marry/VB long-time/JJ girlfriend/NN Cristina/NNP Ventura/NNP ,/, the/DT mother/NN of/IN his/PRP$ one-year-old/JJ twin/JJ daughters/NNS Claudia/NN and/CC Alma/NNP who/WP were/VBD all/RB court-side/JJ ./.

It/PRP was/VBD his/PRP$ 12th/JJ career/NN title/NN ,/, all/DT of/IN which/WDT have/VBP come/VBN on/IN clay/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP broke/VBD a/DT streak/NN of/IN 65/CD events/NNS spread/VBN over/IN three/CD years/NNS since/IN he/PRP had/VBD won/VBN his/PRP$ last/JJ crown/NN ./.

``/`` Although/IN I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB won/VBN on/IN the/DT tour/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN playing/VBG well/RB recently/RB and/CC I/PRP felt/VBD really/RB good/JJ about/IN my/PRP$ chances/NNS today/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Costa/NNP whose/WP$ best/JJS previous/JJ appearances/NNS at/IN Roland/NNP Garros/NNPS had/VBD been/VBN two/CD quarter-final/JJ spots/NNS in/IN 1995/CD and/CC 2000/CD ./.

``/`` I/PRP used/VBD the/DT drop/NN shot/VBD a/DT lot/NN today/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB just/RB because/IN of/IN his/PRP$ injury/NN ./.

I/PRP knew/VBD that/IN Juan/NNP Carlos/NNP is/VBZ very/RB solid/JJ on/IN the/DT baseline/NN so/IN I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO bring/VB him/PRP into/IN the/DT net/NN more/JJR and/CC more/JJR ./. ''/''

Costa/NNP also/RB became/VBD the/DT fifth/JJ Spanish/JJ winner/NN in/IN for/IN the/DT first/JJ two/CD sets/NNS although/IN he/PRP avoided/VBD complete/JJ humiliation/NN when/WRB he/PRP briefly/RB rallied/VBD to/TO take/VB the/DT third/JJ set/NN ./.

Overall/RB it/PRP will/MD be/VB a/DT match/NN to/TO forget/VB for/IN the/DT 11th/JJ seed/NN whose/WP$ injury-hit/JJ season/NN finally/RB came/VBD back/RP to/TO haunt/VB him/PRP at/IN the/DT worst/JJS possible/JJ time/NN as/IN stumbled/VBN through/IN the/DT first/JJ two/CD sets/NNS ./.

``/`` In/IN the/DT first/JJ two/CD sets/NNS ,/, I/PRP really/RB felt/VBD the/DT pain/NN from/IN my/PRP$ ankle/NN and/CC it/PRP spread/VBN to/TO all/DT of/IN my/PRP$ body/NN ./.

I/PRP had/VBD to/TO take/VB some/DT aspirin/NN because/RB of/IN it/PRP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Ferrero/NNP ./.

``/`` I/PRP made/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN mistakes/NNS because/RB of/IN the/DT pain/NN in/IN my/PRP$ leg/NN and/CC my/PRP$ stomach/NN ./.

Then/RB I/PRP improved/VBD a/DT little/JJ bit/NN and/CC I/PRP played/VBD much/RB better/JJR in/IN the/DT third/JJ set/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT fourth/JJ I/PRP had/VBD some/DT chances/NNS and/CC some/DT break/NN points/NNS ,/, but/CC Albert/NNP was/VBD the/DT better/JJR player/NN ./.

``/`` Losing/VBG the/DT first/JJ two/CD sets/NNS meant/VBD I/PRP lost/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN confidence/NN and/CC then/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN courage/NN ,/, but/CC there/EX will/MD be/VB other/JJ finals/NNS for/IN me/PRP ./. ''/''

Costa/NNP settled/VBD quickly/RB into/IN the/DT match/NN and/CC found/VBD his/PRP$ length/NN and/CC direction/NN easier/RBR than/IN his/PRP$ 22-year-old/JJ opponent/NN ,/, who/WP had/VBD been/VBN many/JJ people/NNS 's/POS favorite/NN for/IN the/DT title/NN ./.

He/PRP broke/VBD twice/RB in/IN the/DT first/JJ set/NN to/TO take/VB it/PRP 6-1/CD in/IN just/RB 21/CD minutes/NNS when/WRB Ferrero/NNP hit/VBD a/DT forehand/NN long/RB ./.

Ferrero/NNP ,/, bidding/VBG for/IN his/PRP$ seventh/JJ career/NN title/NN ,/, had/VBD his/PRP$ concentration/NN disturbed/VBN by/IN a/DT 20-minute/JJ rain/NN delay/NN after/IN only/RB two/CD games/NNS and/CC his/PRP$ normally/RB reliable/JJ forehand/NN ,/, so/RB destructive/JJ in/IN his/PRP$ earlier/JJR wins/NNS over/IN Andre/NNP Agassi/NNP and/CC Marat/NNP Safin/NNP ,/, completely/RB deserted/VBN him/PRP ./.

The/DT first/JJ set/NN statistics/NNS told/VBD a/DT tale/NN of/IN woe/NN for/IN Ferrero/NNP -/: he/PRP hit/VBD 14/CD unforced/JJ errors/NNS compared/VBN to/TO just/RB eight/CD for/IN Costa/NNP and/CC just/RB one/CD winner/NN to/TO Costa/NNP 's/POS 10/CD ./.

Things/NNS got/VBD progressively/RB worse/JJR in/IN the/DT second/JJ set/NN as/IN Costa/NNP ,/, who/WP knocked/VBD out/RP triple/JJ champion/NN Gustavo/NNP Kuerten/NNP in/IN the/DT fourth/JJ round/NN and/CC last/JJ year/NN 's/POS runner-up/JJ Alex/NNP Corretja/NNP in/IN the/DT semi-final/NN ,/, enjoyed/VBD three/CD breaks/NNS to/TO win/VB it/PRP 6-0/CD in/IN just/RB 22/CD minutes/NNS ./.

The/DT conclusion/NN of/IN that/DT set/NN meant/VBD Costa/NNP ,/, who/WP had/VBD gone/VBN into/IN the/DT match/NN with/IN a/DT 2-2/CD career/NN record/NN against/IN Ferrero/NNP ,/, had/VBD won/VBN 11/CD games/NNS in/IN a/DT row/NN since/IN the/DT rain/NN break/NN ./.

Ferrero/NNP hit/VBD 13/CD unforced/JJ errors/NNS to/TO Costa/NNP 's/POS five/CD in/IN the/DT second/JJ set/NN and/CC a/DT pitiful/JJ four/CD winners/NNS ./.

However/RB Ferrero/NNP temporarily/RB stopped/VBD the/DT rot/NN in/IN the/DT third/JJ set/NN when/WRB he/PRP won/VBD the/DT first/JJ game/NN on/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ serve/VBP before/IN achieving/VBG a/DT service/NN break/NN on/IN his/PRP$ first/JJ break/NN point/NN of/IN the/DT match/NN to/TO go/VB ahead/RB 2-0/CD ./.

Costa/NNP broke/VBD straight/RB back/RB before/IN Ferrero/NNP found/VBD some/DT resilience/NN by/IN saving/VBG four/CD break/NN points/NNS in/IN the/DT fifth/JJ game/NN to/TO edge/VB ahead/RB 3-2/CD ./.

With/IN the/DT support/NN of/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT 15,000/CD people/NNS watching/VBG on/IN Philippe/NNP Chatrier/NNP Court/NNP ,/, Ferrero/NNP took/VBD the/DT third/JJ set/NN 6-4/NN when/WRB Costa/NNP could/MD only/RB net/VB an/DT attempted/JJ drop/NN shot/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD an/DT impressive/JJ recovery/NN by/IN Ferrero/NNP ,/, playing/VBG in/IN his/PRP$ first/JJ final/JJ after/IN being/VBG a/DT semi-finalist/NN here/RB for/IN the/DT last/JJ two/CD years/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT third/JJ set/NN statistics/NNS made/VBD happier/JJR reading/NN as/IN he/PRP hit/VBD 19/CD winners/NNS compared/VBN to/TO Costa/NNP 's/POS nine/CD while/IN he/PRP also/RB began/VBD to/TO find/VB his/PRP$ range/NN with/IN his/PRP$ first/JJ service/NN -/: 71/CD percent/NN success/NN compared/VBN to/TO 53/CD percent/NN in/IN the/DT second/JJ set/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, Costa/NNP reimposed/VBD his/PRP$ authority/NN quickly/RB in/IN the/DT fourth/JJ set/NN going/VBG up/RP an/DT early/JJ break/NN to/TO lead/VB 2-1/CD as/IN Ferrero/NNP saw/VBD a/DT rasping/VBG forehand/NN hit/VBD the/DT tape/NN and/CC fall/VB back/RP agonisingly/RB on/IN his/PRP$ side/NN ./.

Ferrero/NNP battled/VBD back/RP to/TO level/VB at/IN 3-3/CD before/IN Costa/NNP returned/VBD the/DT compliment/NN to/TO lead/VB 4-3/CD and/CC then/RB held/VBD to/TO love/VB for/IN 5-3/CD ./.

He/PRP wasted/VBD one/CD match/NN point/NN in/IN the/DT next/JJ game/NN but/CC took/VBD the/DT title/NN when/WRB Ferrero/NNP ,/, who/WP only/RB managed/VBD four/CD winners/NNS in/IN the/DT fourth/JJ set/NN ,/, double-faulted/VBD ./.
