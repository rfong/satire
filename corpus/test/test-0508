Malaysia has proposed the formation of a joint business council for the
Brunei-Indonesia- Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area
((BIMP-EAGA)to ensure its success, Bernama news agency reported
Wednesday.

Sarawak, East Malaysia, in mid-April, Bernama quoted BIMP-EAGA
Malaysian Business Council Chairman Abang Abdul Karim Tun Abang Openg
as saying Wednesday in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, East Malaysia.
Although the BIMP-EAGA was formed some seven years ago to promote
regional development and cooperation, it had yet to make any
commendable progress, the chairman said, adding the BIMP-EAGA needs new
mechanism to ensure its success.

Chamber of Commerce and Industry, had proposed the formation of the
BIMP-EAGA Joint Business Council to boost bilateral relations among
members of the grouping.

BIMP-EAGA would be able to move forward faster and more efficiently.
