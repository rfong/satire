Indonesian prosecutors indict Suharto's son for murder
Prosecutors on Thursday indicted Tommy Suharto -- youngest son of the
former Indonesian dictator -- for the murder of a judge, prosecutor Andi
Rachman Azwar told AFP.
Prosecutors have also charged Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra, 39, with
possession of firearms and flight from justice, Azwar said after
submitting files on Tommy to the Central Jakarta district court.
Court official Utol Yusman Sidabalok said the trial would start "in the
near future" but gave no date.
The former millionaire playboy and tycoon is accused of ordering the
contract killing in July 2001 of supreme court judge Syafiuddin
Kartasasmita, who had sentenced him to 18 months' jail for corruption.
Tommy failed to turn himself in to serve the sentence and went on the
run for a year. He was arrested last November 28.
Police say they also found firearms and explosives while searching
premises linked to Tommy during their search for the fugitive.
On February 20 Tommy Suharto was taken to prison in handcuffs pending
trial after spending 12 weeks in police custody while officers
interrogated him.
Tommy built his Humpuss group into one of the country's major
conglomerates just a decade after entering business. By 1998 it had
spawned 48 subsidiaries in fields which included oil, finance,
property, construction, pharmaceuticals, forestry, trade and mining.
But Tommy's star dimmed along with that of his father, who resigned in
May 1998 after mass rioting.
In September 2000 a court headed by Kartasasmita ordered Tommy jailed
for 18 months for a corrupt land deal.
Suharto senior's family amassed enormous wealth during his 32 years in
power and some human rights lawyers are sceptical that Tommy will face
the death penalty if convicted of murder.
