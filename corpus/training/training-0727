Malaysian embassy staff confirm grenade attack 
The Malaysian embassy in Cambodia was slightly damaged when a grenade
was thrown into the compound and exploded outside the building, embassy
staff confirmed Friday.
Unidentified assailants threw a grenade into the embassy grounds early
Thursday, slightly damaging the chancery building, but without causing
any casualties, the staff said.
In Malaysia, Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi was quoted as saying he
had asked for a detailed report on the attack.
"There is a great likelihood that the attackers have mistaken Malaysia
for some other countries," Abdullah was quoted by Bernama news agency
as saying.
"We don't know the identity of the attackers nor the motive. Police are
investigating the incident," Bernama quoted an official of the embassy
as saying by telephone from Phnom Penh.
"Security at the mission has been stepped up," the official said.
