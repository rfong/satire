Central bank to restrict use of monetary policy in 1997 
The Bank of Thailand is to restrict its use of monetary policy as a
tool to stabilise the economy in the year ahead, central bank governor
Rerngchai Marakanond said Thursday.
"The central bank will continue to restrict its use of monetary policy
and exercise more care next year until we are sure that the fiscal
policy can stabilise the Thai economy," said Rerngchai.
The Bank of Thailand would maintain a strict monetary policy, but
Rerngchai said this would be relaxed once fiscal measures had
demonstrated their effectiveness.
Monetary policy would proceed in "a cautious mode with the aim of
reducing the current account deficit" which widened to an estimated 8.2
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996.
He said the central bank aimed to keep inflation below five percent and
reduce the current account deficit to below eight percent of GDP.
The central bank chief forecast that domestic interest rates would ease
in 1997.
"We believe that next year local liquidity will improve and it will
make the domestic interest rates lower and more reasonable than this
year. But I don't want to say how much it should be reduced by,"
Rerngchai said.
The central bank would not intervene in commercial bank decisions on
interest rates, nor would it use its own rate as a guide for commercial
banks, he said.
Rerngchai predicted that local liquidity would improve because around
one trillion baht would be injected into the domestic market from
pension funds of state enterprises and government agencies, starting in
early 1997.
The central bank planned to issue bonds to absorb excess liquidity, he
said.
