China's Financial Industry Continues Smooth Operation 
China's financial sector continued its momentum of smooth operation in
the first five months of this year, with banking loans increasing at a
faster step and corporate deposits registering marked increases.
Statistics released today by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the
country's central bank, shows that by the end of May, the outstanding
amount of loans by all financial institutions stood at 9.6175 trillion
yuan (about 1.23 trillion U.S. dollars), up 13.9 percent from the same
period last year in constant terms.
At the end of May, the outstanding amount of broad money was 12. 4053
trillion yuan, up 12.7 percent from the same period last year but down
one percentage point from the previous month, the growth decline was
caused mainly by the downturn in residents' deposits.
According to the statistics, at the end of May the outstanding amount
of residents' deposits was 6.2195 trillion yuan, up 5.5 percent from
the same period last year but down 1.6 percentage points from the
previous month, major reasons accounting for the downturn were that
residents drew money from banks to invest in the stock market and
treasury bonds.
The outstanding amount of narrow money was 4.649 trillion yuan, up 22.3
percent from the same period last year and up 0.6 percentage points
from the previous month, this rise of growth speed was mainly
contributed by the sharp increase in corporate deposits. By the end of
May the outstanding amount of corporate deposits was 3.9056 trillion
yuan, up 20 percent from the same period last year and 0.5 percentage
points from the previous month.
The outstanding amount of money in circulation was 1.375 trillion yuan,
up 20.1 percent. In May the amount of money withdrawn from circulation
was 60 million yuan.

one U.S. dollar for 8.2773 yuan RMB, with the RMB appreciating 20 basic
points from the end of last year.
