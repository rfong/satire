Yemen, Eritrea Sign Peace Accord over Disputed Islands 
Yemen and Eritrea signed a compromise accord here today over the
disputed Hanish islands in the Red Sea.
The accord was announced by French foreign ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt.
The Hanish islands have been the subject of military conflict between
the two sides since last December.
Under the agreement, the two countries "will renounce the use of force
against each other," and peacefully solve their differences.
They agreed to set up an arbitrary tribunal which will be composed of
two Yemenis and two Eritreans, and will be presided over by an
arbitrator from a third country.
They vowed to respect the verdict of the tribunal "while abstaining
from all forms of activity or military movement against each other"
before the verdict, said the agreement.
Under the arbitration of France, Yemen and Eritrea signed an agreement
of principle in Paris on May 21. But Eritrean troops reoccupied the
strategic islands on August 10.
The troops withdrew two weeks later under French mediation.
