Boutros-Ghali Arrives in Bid to Win Truce, Save U.N. Mission
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday said he might
have to end the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia after the president
rejected a cease-fire and Serbs wouldn't meet with him.
Boutros-Ghali said both sides have to show a willingness to negotiate
and work with U.N. peacekeepers and aid workers who have helped feed
hundreds of thousands of people throughout the 31-month-long war.
``My message to them is that unless they do this, it will become
impossible for me to persuade the Security Council to keep UNPROFOR
here,'' Boutros-Ghali said during a brief visit.
In failing to meet him, Boutros-Ghali said Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic ``has done his people a great disservice.''
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told Boutros-Ghali that Bosnia
would negotiate only when Serbs accepted a plan that they repeatedly
have rejected and that it was ready for a temporary cease-fire on its
own terms.
Sources said Karadzic did not want to travel to the Sarajevo airport to
meet Boutros-Ghali, and that the secretary-general would not go to
Serb-held Lukavica south of the city.
Izetbegovic's comments indicated that the Bosnian government was in no
mood for compromise, either.
After meeting Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Izetbegovic said, ``We are ready
for negotiations when the Serb side says yes to the `contact group'
plan.''
The international community's contact -- diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- devised a plan that
would require the Serbs to reduce their holdings in Bosnia from 70
percent to 49 percent.
The Bosnian government accepted the plan, but the Bosnian Serbs
repeatedly have rejected it.
Izetbegovic reiterated that the Bosnian government has a proposal for a
three-month cease-fire on the table. The Serbs are seeking something
more permanent.
With NATO airstrikes clearly unable to deter the Serbs and the U.N.
peacekeeping mission in a shambles, senior Western officials said
Tuesday that the Bosnian Serbs might be offered ties with Serb-led
Yugoslavia that they long have desired.
That has been missing from previous peace plans.
Bosnian government officials said the idea of Serb ties with Yugoslavia
did not come up directly in the talks.
In brief remarks, Boutros-Ghali termed the meeting with Izetbegovic
``positive.''
Anti-sniper teams, police and at least one French light tank, with its
90mm gun pointed towards Serb positions opposite the Bosnian presidency
building, provided tight security.
And on the eve of the visit, U.N. sources said Dutch peacekeepers in
the Srebrenica safe area came under sustained fire, and asked for
support from NATO warplanes.
But the sources said that the U.N. chief for Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Sir
Michael Rose, had asked NATO not to fly until late Thursday in a bid to
ease tensions in Bosnia.
Several hundred of the 24,000 peacekeepers have been detained by
Bosnian Serbs as insurance against further NATO airstrikes.
U.N. officials said said group of 45 British soldiers was released
Wednesday morning.
In a first statement on his arrival, Boutros-Ghali said, ``I am an
optimist. I hope we'll get new momentum for a cease-fire around
Bihac,'' the U.N.-designated northwestern ``safe area'' that has been
under Serb shelling for the last two weeks.
In a non-binding statement, the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday called
on Serbs to accept a cease-fire and cooperate fully with Boutros-Ghali.
On Tuesday, U.N. spokesman Michael Williams said in Zagreb that the
``absolute rock-bottom'' conditions for continuing the U.N. presence in
Bosnia were a nationwide cease-fire and an end to harassment and
detention of U.N. troops.
U.N. military spokesman Lt. Col. Jan-Dirk von Merveldt said heavy
shelling of the area around Bihac continued until about 2:30 p.m. (1330
GMT) Tuesday. He said there was also small arms and machine gun fire
reported in the area, and a few rounds landed inside the town. There
was no word on casualties. It was quiet overnight.
Von Merveldt also reported that on Tuesday there was shelling and
machine-gun fire in and around Velika Kladusa, where more government
troops are holding out.
Charles Thomas, the U.S. representative to the contact group, said
Tuesday after meeting Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic that there were
no changes to a peace plan rejected by Bosnian Serbs this summer.
Thomas said the contact group would ``stick with the plan,'' which
calls for Serbs to reduce their holdings from 70 percent to 49 percent
of Bosnia.
