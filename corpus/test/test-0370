Largest Group of Dolines Discovered in South China (1)
Dolines are special geological landscape found in karst regions, formed
by repeated cave-ins of the tops of the underground caves. They are
mainly seen in China, Mexico and Papua New Guinea.
The expedition, which is now in this southern Chinese county for the
fifth round of exploration, have so far found 20 big dolines of
different types in Leye, 460 km away from Nanning, the regional capital
of Guangxi.
Cai Wutian, an associate research fellow with the Institute of Karst
and Geology at the Chinese Academy of Geology and a member on the fifth
exploration team, explained that the high concentration of dolines,
formed three to four million years ago ( the Quaternary Period of the
Cenozoic Era), in Leye lies in the fact that dolines encountered a
drastic raising of the earth's crust or mountain-making movement of the
Himalayas in their formation, which has led to the shaping of
Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in southwest China, and Leye is situated at the
transitional zone from the plateau to the lower land to the east.
Aided with know-how and modern means including GPS, this group of
explorers have found Dashiwei Doline, the world' second biggest doline
with 613 meters in depth and a cubage of 80 million cubic meters. The
world's biggest doline, Xiaozhai Doline, with a depth of 660 meters and
cubage of 119 million cubic meters is located in the Chongqing
Municipality on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
A large area of primitive forest has been found at the bottom of
"Dashiwei" Doline, which is inhabited by more than 1,000 varieties of
plants, including many rare and precious species, and some smaller
creatures, such as blind fish, crabs, shrimp, and flying squirrels.
