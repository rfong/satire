Experts/NNS said/VBD as/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS macroeconomic/JJ framework/NN has/VBZ achieved/VBN a/DT degree/NN of/IN stability/NN ,/, focus/NN has/VBZ turned/VBN to/TO efforts/NNS to/TO streamline/VB regulations/NNS to/TO make/VB the/DT system/NN transparent/JJ and/CC accountable/JJ ./.

The/DT first/JJ year/NN of/IN the/DT Thailand/NNP economic/JJ program/NN under/IN the/DT IMF/NNP 's/POS 17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar/JJ rescue/NN package/NN witnessed/VBN changes/NNS in/IN fiscal/JJ and/CC monetary/JJ policy/NN ,/, exchange/NN rate/NN ,/, net/JJ international/JJ reserves/NNS ,/, interest/NN rates/NNS ,/, economic/JJ growth/NN rate/NN ,/, external/JJ accounts/NNS and/CC balance/NN of/IN payments/NNS ./.

Despite/IN all/PDT the/DT criticism/NN of/IN the/DT bitter/JJ pills/NNS prescribed/VBN by/IN the/DT IMF/NNP in/IN the/DT previous/JJ four/CD letters/NNS of/IN intent/NN ,/, Thailand/NNP has/VBZ come/VBN through/IN its/PRP$ worst/JJS nightmares/NNS to/TO achieve/VB a/DT relatively/RB stable/JJ economic/JJ framework/NN ./.

The/DT baht/NN has/VBZ been/VBN stable/JJ at/IN 41/CD to/TO 42/CD baht/NN against/IN the/DT U.S./NNP dollar/NN with/IN net/JJ international/JJ reserves/NNS expected/VBN to/TO hit/VB 26-28/CD billion/CD U.S./NNP dollars/NNS by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT year/NN ./.

Short-term/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS ,/, which/WDT hit/VBD 24/CD percent/NN in/IN December/NNP 1997/CD ,/, have/VBP fallen/VBN to/TO 10-12/CD percent/NN ./.

In/IN May/NNP this/DT year/NN ,/, IMF/NNP and/CC Thai/NNP Finance/NNP Minister/NNP Tarrin/NNP Nimmanhaeminda/NNP changed/VBD their/PRP$ stance/NN at/IN the/DT fiscal-tightening/JJ policy/NN ,/, allowing/VBG fiscal/JJ deficit/NN spending/NN to/TO act/VB as/IN an/DT economic/JJ stimulus/NN ./.

With/IN all/PDT these/DT achievements/NNS ,/, experts/NNS say/VBP that/IN Thailand/NNP now/RB enters/VBZ into/IN the/DT reconstruction/NN phase/NN ,/, where/WRB microeconomic/JJ framework/NN will/MD come/VB into/IN full/JJ play/NN ./.

Analysts/NNS said/VBD that/IN the/DT economic/JJ recovery/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB seen/VBN if/IN Thailand/NNP does/VBZ not/RB follow/VB up/RP with/IN implementation/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ and/CC economic/JJ reform/NN as/IN outlined/VBN in/IN the/DT IMF/NNP program/NN ./.

Halting/VBG the/DT economic/JJ decline/NN and/CC the/DT rising/VBG non-performing/JJ loans/NNS in/IN the/DT banking/NN system/NN requires/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ microeconomic/JJ framework/NN to/TO put/VB the/DT banks/NNS back/RP in/IN business/NN and/CC clean/VB up/RP their/PRP$ balance/NN sheets/NNS ./.

The/DT comprehensive/JJ financial/JJ reform/NN package/NN announced/VBN by/IN the/DT government/NN on/IN August/NNP 14/CD is/VBZ aimed/VBN at/IN addressing/VBG the/DT problems/NNS through/IN government/NN intervention/NN and/CC mergers/NNS ,/, privatization/NN of/IN state-controlled/JJ banks/NNS ,/, raising/VBG public/JJ funds/NNS for/IN banks/NNS '/POS recapitalization/NN and/CC developing/VBG private/JJ asset/NN management/NN companies/NNS ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, the/DT government/NN is/VBZ eliminating/VBG impediments/NNS and/CC strengthening/VBG the/DT broader/JJR incentive/NN framework/NN for/IN restructuring/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD include/VB the/DT elimination/NN of/IN tax/NN disincentives/NNS for/IN debt/NN restructuring/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT revision/NN of/IN Bank/NNP of/IN Thailand/NNP regulations/NNS for/IN loan/NN classification/NN and/CC collateral/NN appraisal/NN ./.

The/DT government/NN has/VBZ further/RBR taken/VBN on/IN the/DT banking/NN reform/NN by/IN creating/VBG a/DT Financial/NNP Sector/NNP Restructuring/NNP Advisory/NNP Committee/NNP to/TO ensure/VB the/DT successful/JJ implementation/NN of/IN the/DT banking/VBG reform/NN package/NN ./.

Despite/IN all/DT the/DT government/NN 's/POS macro/JJ -/: and/CC micro-economic/JJ efforts/NNS to/TO bring/VB the/DT country/NN 's/POS economy/NN back/RP on/IN foot/NN ,/, Thailand/NNP 's/POS economic/JJ recovery/NN also/RB hinges/VBZ on/IN external/JJ factors/NNS ,/, particularly/RB Japan/NNP 's/POS and/CC the/DT region/NN 's/POS economic/JJ performance/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT fifth/JJ letter/NN of/IN intent/NN ,/, the/DT government/NN forecast/VBP that/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS economy/NN will/MD bottom/VB out/RP early/RB next/JJ year/NN after/IN a/DT 7-percent/JJ contraction/NN in/IN 1998/CD ./.

Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Chuan/NNP Leekpai/NNP hinted/VBD that/IN IMF/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ government/NN expect/VBP the/DT economy/NN possibly/RB expanding/VBG at/IN a/DT flat/JJ zero/CD percent/NN or/CC a/DT slight/JJ 0.5/CD percent/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT forecast/NN will/MD mean/VB nothing/NN ,/, as/IN forecast/NN in/IN the/DT previous/JJ four/CD letters/NNS of/IN intent/NN ,/, if/IN the/DT currency/NN and/CC banking/NN crisis/NN continues/VBZ in/IN Japan/NNP and/CC other/JJ emerging/VBG markets/NNS ./.
