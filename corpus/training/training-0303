Dow Down 77 Points 
Share prices in the New York Stock market fell Monday under the
pressure of profit-taking after a long period of advance.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 77.50 points lower to 8,897.96
and most of other market indicators followed suit except for the
technology-laced Nasdaq composite index which inched up 4.49 points.
The blue-chip barometer opened about 10 points higher, failing to reach
9,000 level with a shortage of 15 points. But soon it took a dive amid
selling efforts. At a point it even lost 130 points.
The Dow saw a month-long gain as of Friday, with an advance of 1,067
points or 13.5 percent from the year's starting point, only 362.51
points shy of its July 17 peak of 9,337.97.
On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners led advancers 7-4 with
trading volume totaling 590 million shares down from 680 million
previously.
