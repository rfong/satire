China's Largest Historic Private Residence Opens to Tourists 
The Wang Family Quadrangle, a 150,000-square-meter group of residential
buildings with an history of more than 200 years in Lingshi County in
north China's Shanxi Province, opened to tourists on Tuesday.
The structures were built in the reign of Emperor Qianlong (1736-1795
A.D.) during the Qing Dynasty over a period of 50 years and at enormous
expense.
The building group is located at the foot of Mianshan Mountain, 150
kilometers from Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province.
The Wang Family became very wealthy after several generations of hard
work, beginning as bean-curd vendors.
In this large family's prime, 42 family members served as Qing Dynasty
officials, above the provincial level.
These old buildings are divided into two parts, the Hongmenpu section
includes 28 separate buildings, each with a courtyard and paved paths
among the courtyards arranged in the shape of the Chinese character
"Wang."
Gaojiaya, the other part of the Wang Family Quadrangle, is a
traditional Siheyuan, or a courtyard, with compounds where large
courtyards opens off onto smaller ones in succession.
Archaeologists say this historic building group is of great value for
research, where the wood, brick and stone carvings of the quadrangles
added color to the old buildings.
