Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic later implored Chretien not to pull
Canadian peacekeepers out of the war-torn country. But Izetbegovic had
angry words for other world leaders at the summit, including the president
of the United States and the UN secretary general. The Muslim leader
bitterly accused the world of failing to end a bloody war that has claimed
more than 200,000 lives. ``The result shall be a discredited United
Nations, a ruined NATO, demoralized Europeans with a feeling of
incapability to respond to the first crisis after the Cold War,'' he said.
