Japan drug maker to restructure after AIDS scandal 
Japanese drug maker Green Cross Corp., under investigation over the
sale of HIV-tainted blood products in the 1980s, plans to reduce its
plants and workforce.
Japan's top supplier of blood products will close and sell two of its
four plants while building a new plant, Green Cross officials said
Saturday.
The company will also cut its workforce from 2,400 to 2,000 over the
next four years by curtailing recruitment, the officials said.
Green Cross hopes to gain financial support from its main bank, Sakura
Bank, for the plans. It is to pay more than 24 billion yen (220 million
dollars) in compensation to AIDS victims, the officials said.
The company has been investigated on suspicion of professional
negligence over the sale of HIV-tainted products that caused Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome among hemophiliacs.
In March, the health ministry and five pharmaceutical firms including
Green Cross reached a court-mediated settlement on compensation for
some 400 hemophiliacs who contracted AIDS through untreated blood
products.
They agreed to pay 45 million yen to each of the victims.
Badly hit by a boycott of its products, Green Cross is forecast to
suffer a pre-tax loss of more than five billion yen in the year to
March 1997.
