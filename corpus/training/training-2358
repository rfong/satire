Hubble telescope spots semi-nude human remains on our Moon's surface!
Scientists released information, along with a Top Secret report, about the
discovery of a human remains dressed in a bathrobe spotted laying on the
surface of the Earth's Moon! The dessicated figure was was discovered by
the Hubble space telescope last March during a routine scan of the lunar
surface. First reports claimed the body was that of a middle-aged female.
The exact location is still secret but it is known to be in Mons Delphi
region that is considered the most rugged and mountainous.
From high definition video taken by the Hubble, scientists have pieced
together the identity of the frozen and dessicated female remains.
Major Robert Broward commented on the gristly discover, "We have
determined from high definition photos and facial recognition analysis,
that the remains on the Moon are those of television sit-com 'The
Honeymooners' star Alice Kramden."
Kramden, the housewife of bus driver Ralph Kramden, was last seen
visting Trixie Norton in her Bensonhurst apartment in Brooklyn, New
York in the spring of 1962.
Due to the high profile threats of physical abuse and his often
repeated phrase of'to the moon Alice' by her husband Ralph, an
investigation by NYPD has begun.
NYPD detective Morry Steinblatz recalled "There were many instances of
Ralph threatening her, I guess one time he actually sent her to the
moon!"
