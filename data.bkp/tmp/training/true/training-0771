Japan/NNP Defends/NNPS Rejection/NNP of/IN Flu/NNP Vaccines/NNP for/IN Quake/NN Victims/VBZ An/DT American/JJ relief/NN organization/NN thought/VBD Japan/NNP would/MD need/VB flu/NN vaccine/NN for/IN earthquake/NN victims/NNS and/CC offered/VBD a/DT million/CD doses/NNS ./.

But/CC Japan/NNP says/VBZ it/PRP has/VBZ plenty/RB of/IN vaccine/NN to/TO go/VB around/RP ,/, so/IN the/DT aid/NN is/VBZ sitting/VBG unused/JJ in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.

To/TO some/DT critics/NNS ,/, the/DT stalemate/NN over/IN the/DT offer/NN by/IN AmeriCares/NNP of/IN New/NNP Canaan/NNP ,/, Conn./NNP ,/, is/VBZ an/DT illustration/NN of/IN Japanese/JJ red/JJ tape/NN in/IN the/DT wake/NN of/IN the/DT devastating/JJ Jan./NNP 17/CD quake/NN that/WDT killed/VBD at/IN least/JJS 5,273/CD people/NNS ./.

But/CC to/TO Japanese/JJ officials/NNS ,/, the/DT moral/JJ of/IN the/DT story/NN is/VBZ different/JJ :/: Japan/NNP was/VBD offered/VBN aid/NN it/PRP never/RB asked/VBD for/IN and/CC does/VBZ n't/RB need/VB ,/, they/PRP say/VBP ,/, and/CC now/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ being/VBG criticized/VBN for/IN not/RB accepting/VBG it/PRP ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB the/DT first/JJ time/NN foreign/JJ aid/NN for/IN the/DT quake/NN victims/NNS has/VBZ touched/VBN off/IN controversy/NN ./.

Critics/NNS have/VBP complained/VBN that/IN petty/JJ bureaucratic/JJ rules/NNS were/VBD preventing/VBG foreign/JJ help/NN from/IN reaching/VBG victims/NNS ;/: in/IN one/CD case/NN ,/, foreign/JJ doctors/NNS were/VBD prevented/VBN from/IN seeing/VBG patients/NNS for/IN a/DT day/NN because/IN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB Japanese/JJ medical/JJ licenses/NNS ./.

The/DT United/NNP States/NNPS offered/VBD to/TO house/NN evacuees/NNS on/IN an/DT aircraft/NN carrier/NN but/CC was/VBD turned/VBN down/RP by/IN the/DT Japanese/JJ government/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN refugees/NNS later/RB took/VBD shelter/NN on/IN a/DT Japanese/JJ passenger/NN boat/NN ./.

The/DT vaccine/NN case/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, could/MD be/VB different/JJ ./.

``/`` At/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD provide/VB for/IN our/PRP$ needs/NNS with/IN the/DT vaccine/NN we/PRP have/VBP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Miki/NNP Fujiwara/NNP of/IN the/DT health/NN department/NN in/IN the/DT hardest-hit/JJ city/NN of/IN Kobe/NNP ./.

Officials/NNS in/IN Kobe/NNP and/CC the/DT Health/NNP and/CC Welfare/NNP Ministry/NNP said/VBD only/JJ people/NNS over/IN 65/CD are/VBP being/VBG encouraged/VBN to/TO receive/VB the/DT vaccine/NN ./.

Younger/NNP people/NNS do/VBP n't/RB need/VB to/TO be/VB vaccinated/VBN because/IN they/PRP 're/VBP unlikely/JJ to/TO become/VB seriously/RB ill/RB even/RB if/IN they/PRP catch/VB the/DT flu/NN ,/, said/VBD the/DT ministry/NN 's/POS Yoshinobu/NNP Hirayama/NNP ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, flu/NN has/VBZ n't/RB become/VBN a/DT serious/JJ epidemic/NN ,/, despite/IN the/DT chilly/JJ conditions/NNS in/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT emergency/NN shelters/NNS ./.

Some/DT of/IN the/DT misunderstanding/NN may/MD stem/VB from/IN different/JJ views/NNS of/IN how/WRB vaccinations/NNS should/MD be/VB used/VBN ./.

Japanese/JJ officials/NNS stress/VBP the/DT possible/JJ side/NN effects/NNS ,/, noting/VBG that/IN people/NNS with/IN colds/NNS may/MD also/RB develop/VB a/DT fever/NN after/IN being/VBG vaccinated/VBN ./.

That/DT 's/VBZ why/WRB only/RB about/RB 100/CD to/TO 200/CD people/NNS are/VBP receiving/VBG the/DT flu/NN shots/NNS each/DT day/NN in/IN Kobe/NNP ,/, Fujiwara/NNP said/VBD ./.

But/CC Andrew/NNP Hannah/NNP ,/, executive/JJ vice/NN president/NN of/IN AmeriCares/NNP ,/, said/VBD :/: ``/`` You/PRP want/VBP to/TO immunize/VB as/IN many/JJ people/NNS as/IN you/PRP possibly/RB can/MD ''/'' to/TO prevent/VB epidemics/NNS from/IN spreading/VBG ./.

He/PRP added/VBD ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN ``/`` you/PRP have/VBP to/TO defer/VB ''/'' to/TO Japan/NNP 's/POS judgment/NN of/IN what/WP health/NN measures/NNS are/VBP necessary/JJ ./.

Hannah/NNP said/VBD AmeriCares/NNP offered/VBD the/DT flu/NN vaccines/NNS to/TO Japan/NNP because/IN it/PRP had/VBD a/DT large/JJ supply/NN available/JJ from/IN a/DT donor/NN drug/NN company/NN that/WDT had/VBD surplus/NN vaccines/NNS in/IN stock/NN ./.

Since/IN the/DT vaccine/NN takes/VBZ several/JJ weeks/NNS to/TO have/VB an/DT effect/NN ,/, no/DT one/NN knows/VBZ now/RB who/WP is/VBZ right/JJ ./.

Fujiwara/NNP contended/VBD a/DT flu/NN epidemic/NN will/MD be/VB unlikely/JJ in/IN several/JJ weeks/NNS time/NN because/IN the/DT weather/NN will/MD be/VB warmer/JJR and/CC many/JJ people/NNS will/MD have/VB moved/VBN out/RP of/IN crowded/VBN refugee/NN shelters/NNS ./.

But/CC the/DT complexity/NN of/IN the/DT situation/NN has/VBZ n't/RB stopped/VBN critics/NNS of/IN the/DT government/NN from/IN jumping/VBG in/IN to/TO attack/NN ./.

Officials/NNS of/IN the/DT main/JJ opposition/NN party/NN in/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT New/NNP Frontier/NNP Party/NNP ,/, contacted/VBD foreign/JJ journalists/NNS last/JJ week/NN to/TO present/VB the/DT vaccine/NN case/NN as/IN an/DT illustration/NN of/IN incompetence/NN by/IN Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Tomiichi/NNP Murayama/NNP 's/POS government/NN ./.

``/`` They/PRP are/VBP incapable/JJ of/IN managing/VBG emergencies/NNS ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Yukinori/NNP Murayama/NNP ,/, an/DT aide/NN to/TO opposition/NN legislator/NN Yuriko/NNP Koike/NNP ./.
