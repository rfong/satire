UN Team Arrives in Baghdad for Discussion of Food 
A U.N. team arrived here today for discussion with Iraqi officials on
the distribution of food and medicine for Iraqis under the oil-for-food
accord signed between Iraq and the U.N. on May 20.
The team, headed by Raymond Sommereyns, director of West Asian Affairs
at the United Nations, comprises six experts specialized in oil and
customs affairs.
Upon his arrival, Sommereyns said that his mission was sent by U.N.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to ensure that accord can be
implemented as soon as possible. "It is a technical mission, we will
probably stay here for one week," he added.
During their stay in Iraq, the six-member team will also survey sites
related to oil exports and the import of humanitarian supplies
desperately needed by Iraqis who have been suffering tremendously from
six years of the sanctions imposed on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in August 1990.
Following the signing of the oil-for-food deal by Iraq and the U.N.,
the Iraqi government has stepped up its efforts to get everything ready
for an early export of limited quantity of oil to pay for the food and
medicine for its people.
A detailed plan for exporting of oil and distribution of food and
medicine, which is to be submitted to the U.N. for discussion, is
expected to be finalized soon by the Iraqi government.
At a cabinet meeting held on Thursday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
expressed his desire for a quick implementation of the partial oil sale
accord, allowing Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every
six months, the first in six years of the U.N. sanctions, to pay for
the foodstuff and medicine.
