Canadian Government Stops New Borrowing, Report 
The Canadian government has stopped new borrowing for the first time in
25 years, issuing no new bonds a year earlier than expected, a report
said today.
The government has reached the point of no longer needing to issue new
debt to finance its operations, according to a report released today by
investment dealer Nesbitt Burns Inc..
Data from the Bank of Canada indicates that the Canadian federal
government has been running a financial requirement surplus for the
past two months.
"Everybody has been talking about the looming shortage of new bonds in
Canada," Nesbitt's senior economist David Rosenberg was quoted as
saying by Canada's leading newspaper the Globe and Mail.
The federal deficit should be about 5 billion Canadian dollars (3.6
billion USD) for the fiscal year that began April 1, compared with the
official prediction of 17 billion dollars' (12.4 billion USD)
shortfall.
This year's sudden pickup in Canada's consumer spending is the most
likely reason for the improved federal financial situation, the
economist noted.
Despite the improved picture, the government will still have to roll
over a stock of existing bonds now valued at 304 billion dollars (221
billion USD), the report noted.
