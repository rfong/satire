Yuanjiang River Dammed for Power Plant Construction 
China has completed the second-stage damming of the Yuanjiang River for
the construction of the Lingjintan hydro-electrical power station in
central China's Hunan Province.
The 270,000-kilowatt station will coordinate with another major power
station, Wuqiangxi, to develop the Yuanjiang River, "China Electric
Power News" has reported.
China plans to build power plants at different altitudes along the
river, and to develop agriculture and tourism in the locality in order
to promote economic development in western Hunan, the Beijing-based
newspaper said.
Development of the river at various heights is expected to be completed
in the year 2015, according to vice provincial governor Zhou Bohua.
