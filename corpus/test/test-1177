Mobil Oil Corporation declares bankruptcy
Mobil Oil Company announced today that it could no longer compete against
alternative energy sources and it will be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection. Shares of Mobil stock closed at $0.97, down from $86.52 just
three years ago.
"We are approaching the end of our days", said Mobil chairman Rex
Tillerson. "Hydrogen, solar, hydroelectric and clean-burning natural
fuels have succeeded in forcing us to stop importing foreign oil. I
must apologize to our investors and employees".
Mobil has fallen far from it's glory days when oil topped $133.00 per
barrel in 2008. The current price for oil stands at $7.87 per barrel.
"We can't give the stuff away", Tillerson continued. "Why would anyone
buy oil when they can just slap up solar panels and have all their
fuel, heating and electricity paid for?"
Though the oil industry continues to plummet, solar and other forms of
alternative energy are thriving. Richard Feldt, President of Evergreen
Solar, claims this is a victory for the human race.
"Thanks to solar and other forms of alternative energy we will rid the
world of global warming and make this a productive, healthy and safe
world for our children", Feldt declared. "We have faced the enemy of
foreign oil and we have won!"
General Motors, Ford, Toyota and other car manufacturers cheered the
bankruptcy of Mobil Oil and promised to produce only clean-burning,
emissions free vehicles from now on.
"To quote a famous line from a movie, Ding Dong, the Witch is dead",
said General Motors Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner.
Exxon, Inc. claims it will also file for bankruptcy next week. Exxon
has already laid off 83% of their staff.
"We will not give up!!! You Americans will pay!!!" declared Sheik
Abdullah al-TarikiSheik Abdullah al-Tariki, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister
to muffled laughter from the audience.
