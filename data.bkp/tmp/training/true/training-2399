Cuban/NNP Rejects/NNPS U.S./VBP Terms/NNS for/IN Friendlier/NNP Ties/VBG The/DT most-senior/JJ Cuban/JJ official/NN to/TO visit/VB Washington/NNP in/IN 35/CD years/NNS ruled/VBD out/RP Cuban/JJ acceptance/NN of/IN U.S./NNP terms/NNS for/IN a/DT more/RBR normal/JJ relationship/NN Friday/NNP ./.

He/PRP said/VBD that/IN to/TO do/VB otherwise/RB would/MD be/VB undignified/VBN ./.

The/DT visit/NN by/IN National/NNP Assembly/NNP President/NNP Ricardo/NNP Alarcon/NNP was/VBD the/DT first/JJ by/IN a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT Cuban/JJ hierarchy/NN since/IN Fidel/NNP Castro/NNP came/VBD here/RB in/IN 1959/CD as/IN a/DT 32-year-old/JJ revolutionary/NN less/JJR than/IN four/CD months/NNS after/IN assuming/VBG power/NN ./.

Alarcon/NNP spent/VBD an/DT hour/NN explaining/VBG Cuba/NNP 's/POS foreign/JJ and/CC domestic/JJ policies/NNS during/IN a/DT National/NNP Press/NNP Club/NNP appearance/NN that/WDT demonstrated/VBD ,/, albeit/IN briefly/NN ,/, the/DT country/NN 's/POS capacity/NN to/TO stir/VB emotions/NNS ./.

Near/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN his/PRP$ appearance/NN ,/, a/DT woman/NN in/IN the/DT audience/NN named/VBD Vilma/NNP Fernandez/NNP interrupted/JJ Alarcon/NNP and/CC challenged/VBD him/PRP to/TO discuss/VB the/DT fate/NN of/IN her/PRP$ husband/NN ,/, Pablo/NNP Reyes/NNPS Martinez/NNP ./.

She/PRP said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD serving/VBG an/DT eight-year/JJ prison/NN term/NN because/IN he/PRP had/VBD tried/VBN to/TO work/VB as/IN an/DT independent/JJ journalist/NN ./.

Alarcon/NNP said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD not/RB familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT case/NN ./.

She/PRP quieted/VBD down/RP after/IN a/DT second/JJ interruption/NN and/CC appeals/NNS for/IN order/NN ./.

After/IN the/DT luncheon/NN ,/, Fernandez/NNP said/VBD her/PRP$ husband/NN ,/, a/DT dissident/NN ,/, was/VBD found/VBN guilty/JJ in/IN April/NNP 1992/CD of/IN disseminating/VBG ``/`` enemy/NN propaganda/NN ./. ''/''

Aside/RB from/IN a/DT small/JJ anti-Castro/JJ sidewalk/NN demonstration/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN ,/, Alarcon/NNP 's/POS appearance/NN went/VBD smoothly/RB ./.

He/PRP contemptuously/RB dismissed/VBD U.S./NNP suggestions/NNS that/IN Cuba/NNP open/VBP up/RP its/PRP$ political/JJ system/NN in/IN return/NN for/IN the/DT lifting/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP embargo/NN ./.

Cuba/NNP would/MD not/RB even/RB agree/VB to/TO ``/`` minor/JJ changes/NNS ''/'' if/IN they/PRP were/VBD the/DT result/NN of/IN pressure/NN ``/`` from/IN the/DT very/RB same/JJ nation/NN that/WDT has/VBZ refused/VBN to/TO accept/VB our/PRP$ independence/NN ,/, ''/'' Alarcon/NNP said/VBD ./.

At/IN another/DT point/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` Cuba/NNP is/VBZ simply/RB not/RB a/DT U.S./NNP colony/NN ./. ''/''

He/PRP described/VBD the/DT Cuban/JJ revolution/NN not/RB as/IN an/DT aberration/NN but/CC rather/RB as/IN another/DT expression/NN of/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS historic/JJ yearning/NN to/TO forge/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ destiny/NN free/JJ from/IN outside/JJ interference/NN ./.

Alarcon/NNP is/VBZ a/DT former/JJ foreign/JJ minister/NN who/WP ,/, after/IN long/JJ years/NNS as/IN a/DT trusted/VBN diplomatic/JJ emissary/NN of/IN the/DT revolution/NN ,/, was/VBD named/VBN president/NN of/IN the/DT National/NNP Assembly/NNP two/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./.

He/PRP nonetheless/RB has/VBZ been/VBN serving/VBG simultaneously/RB as/IN the/DT official/NN most/RBS responsible/JJ for/IN dealings/NNS with/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ,/, leading/VBG Cuba/NNP 's/POS delegation/NN during/IN two/CD rounds/NNS of/IN talks/NNS on/IN migration/NN issues/NNS with/IN U.S./NNP officials/NNS over/IN the/DT past/JJ three/CD months/NNS ./.

Normally/RB ,/, Washington/NNP is/VBZ off-limits/JJ to/TO high-ranking/JJ Cuban/JJ officials/NNS but/CC the/DT State/NNP Department/NNP made/VBD an/DT exception/NN when/WRB Alarcon/NNP asked/VBD to/TO be/VB admitted/VBN as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT Cuban/JJ delegation/NN to/TO a/DT Pan/NNP American/NNP Health/NNP Organization/NNP meeting/NN ./.

Unlike/IN the/DT Organization/NNP of/IN American/NNP States/NNPS ,/, from/IN which/WDT Cuba/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN excluded/VBN for/IN 33/CD years/NNS ,/, the/DT country/NN has/VBZ remained/VBN a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT Washington-based/JJ PAHO/NN continuously/RB ./.

As/IN host/NN country/NN for/IN PAHO/NNP ,/, an/DT international/JJ organization/NN ,/, U.S./NNP officials/NNS have/VBP little/JJ choice/NN but/CC to/TO grant/VB visa/NN requests/NNS from/IN member/NN country/NN representatives/NNS for/IN PAHO/NNP activities/NNS ./.

Alarcon/NNP ,/, who/WP arrived/VBD last/JJ weekend/NN ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN required/VBN to/TO remain/VB within/IN 25/CD miles/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 40/CD kilometers/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- of/IN Washington/NNP under/IN terms/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ visa/NN ./.

Some/DT Cuban/JJ exile/NN opponents/NNS saw/VBD the/DT granting/NN of/IN the/DT visa/NN to/TO Alarcon/NNP as/IN a/DT U.S./NNP gesture/NN to/TO Cuba/NNP but/CC American/JJ officials/NNS said/VBD no/DT meetings/NNS with/IN him/PRP have/VBP been/VBN held/VBN or/CC are/VBP planned/VBN ./.
