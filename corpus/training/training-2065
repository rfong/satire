Chinese, Nigerian, Algerian journalists honored in 
Chinese journalist Gao Yu, currently serving a six-year jail term in
China for leaking state secrets, was honored here Tuesday for
courageous reporting under dangerous circumstances.
The Washington-based International Women's Media Foundation named Gao,
along with three other female reporters, to receive its 1995 Courage in
Journalism Award, a spokeswoman for the foundation said.
Daisy Li, assigment editor of the pro-Chinese Hong Kong daily Ming Pao,
accepted the award in Gao's place, the spokeswoman said.
Gao, 51, was arrested in October 1993 as she prepared to travel to the
United States and charged with "spying and illegally providing state
secrets." Human rights groups charge that she was a target of political
persecution.
Other journalists to receive the award were jailed Nigerian editor
Chris Anyanwu, Algerian producer Horria Saihi, and American
correspondent Helen Thomas.
Anyanwu, editor in chief of the independent weekly Sunday Magazine, was
arrested in May just weeks after she refused to publicly support the
military government in Nigeria.
She was charged with concealing her sources in connection with an
alleged coup to topple the regime.
Saihi, a television producer and reporter, faces a death sentence by
Algerian Moslem fundamentalists. She has opposed government censorship
and fundamentalism since the mid-1980s.
Thomas, who has worked for United Press International for 52 years and
remains a fixture at White House news conferences, received the
foundation's lifetime achievement award.
Now in her 70s, Thomas was the first woman correspondent to serve as
White House bureau chief.
Each recipient of the 1995 Courage in Journalism Award received 2,000
dollars and a crystal sculpture at a dinner in their honor late Monday.
