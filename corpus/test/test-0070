UN rights forum ends 19-year-long scrutiny of Iran 
The UN's top human rights forum ended 19 years of scrutiny of Iran's
human rights record on Monday, after it rejected a move by European
countries to formally criticise the strict Islamic regime in Teheran.
Twenty of the 53 countries in the UN Human Rights Commission voted
against an EU-sponsored resolution, which had noted progress in Iran
but also expressed concern at continued "public and especially cruel
executions", the use of torture, and the deterioration of freedom of
expression.
They included Asian and Middle Eastern countries, some African states
as well as Cuba.
Nineteen mainly European and Latin American countries voted in favour
of the resolution, which would also have extended the mandate of the
commission's special representative for Iran, Maurice Copithorne.
Iran's delegate, Paimaneh Hastaie, had rejected the proposed move as a
"biased, futile and routine exercise pursued by a few for political
objectives", and appealed to the commission for cooperation.
"To this end, we are prepared to contemplate another practical
alternative to replace this current mechanism," she told the forum,
without adding details.
Hastaie, an Iranian foreign ministry official, insisted that Iran was
moving "towards a full fledged democracy" under President Mohammed
Khatami and remained committed to human rights.
"External pressures and interference would hamper the normal stand of
this process," she added.
In his last report, which was presented to the UN commission last
month, Copithorne had signalled that political and social change in
Iran had reached the stage where it was unstoppable.
The UN expert noted that Iran's judiciary, which is dominated by
conservative clerics, was largely responsible for ongoing abuse.
The commission's annual meeting is due to end on Friday.
