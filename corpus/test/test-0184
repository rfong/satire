Canada, EU reported to have reached accord on fishing dispute 
Canada and the European Union have reached an agreement to end to their
North Atlantic fishing row, a diplomatic source reported here early
Sunday.
No details of the deal were released but Canadian Fisheries Minister
Brian Tobin was due to hold a press conference in Ottawa in the next
several hours to explain the accord.
Representatives from the 15 EU member states were to gather here at
0730 GMT to endorse the agreement, the source said.
Canada and the European Union have been locked in a bitter dispute over
fishing on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, where according to
Canadian officials stocks of turbot are facing extinction because of
over-fishing by Spanish and Portuguese trawlers.
The dispute escalated March 9 when the Canadian Coast Guard seized a
Spanish boat, the Estai, and later cut the nets of another. Both
trawlers had been operating outside Canadian territorial waters.
A previous bid to settle the row failed in talks here Friday, prompting
Canada to threaten further moves against EU trawlers.
