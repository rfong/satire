Former Sri Lankan Consul General Awaiting Trial 
A former consul general for Sri Lanka in Jordan will be brought to
trial soon on charges of selling illegitimate babies of Sri Lankan
maids and raping Sri Lankan women in Jordan, official sources here said
today.
T. A. Khajil, a Jordanian, had been hired by the Sri Lankan government,
according to the sources.
His post was relieved in March this year and since then he has been
detained for investigations related to various charges, including baby
trading, sexual assault and rape of Sri Lankan working women in Jordan,
the sources said.
The investigation is over now and the Jordanian prosecutor-general
referred the case involving Khajil to the criminal court Wednesday, the
sources quoted reports reaching here from Amman as saying.
The date for the trial is expected to be set within a week, the sources
added.
