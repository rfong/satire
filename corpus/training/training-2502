Bosnian Serbs accuse government forces of disarming Bangladeshi peacekeepers 
Bosnian Serb forces Wednesday accused government forces of "forcibly
disarming" UN Bangladeshi peace-keepers in the northwest enclave of
Bihac.
General Milan Gvero said in a letter to UN Protection Force commander
in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, that the Bosnian government 5th
Corps had "forcibly disarmed more than 500 blue helmets from the
Bangladeshi battalion" in the embattled Bihac pocket.
Separately, it was announced Wednesday in Sarajevo that the UN would
temporarily withdraw a third of 1,200 Bangladeshi peacekeepers in Bihac
because of difficulties in resupplying them.
Thong Nguyen, a UN Protection Force official in Belgrade, denied any
knowledge of Bangladeshi troops being disarmed.
The Moslem Bangladeshi troops, who replaced French forces in Bihac in
October, arrived with precious few supplies and weapons, mainly because
Croatian Serbs refused to allow these through checkpoints into the
enclave.
Gvero charged that Bosnian Moslem soldiers had confiscated "all
personal and heavy weapons," along with ammunition and supplies,
including sleeping bags.
"We demand that you open an investigation into the disarming of the
Bangladeshi battalion by the Moslems and inform the UN Security Council
and international opinion," Gvero said in his letter quoted by Tanjug
news agency.
