Castro Back Home From Dominican Visit 
Cuban President Fidel Castro returned home late Monday after ending his
first visit to the Dominican Republic.
During his stay in Dominica, Castro exchanged views with Dominican
President Leonel Fernandez on bilateral ties and regional and
international issues.
President Fernandez lauded Castro as a living historical force, saying
that his defiance against all unjust and unreasonable phenomena could
make him an icon for quite a number of people in the world.
Castro also visited the home town of Maximo Gomez, a Dominican who led
Cuba's independence war in the last century.
In his speech, Castro urged the Caribbean countries to forge an
anti-U.S. strategic alliance with the Latin American countries.
Castro came to this island nation to attend the August 20-22 meeting of
the 16-nation Cariforum trade group as an observer. Cuba was accepted
as a full member of Cariforum during the conference.
Cuba resumed diplomatic ties with the Dominican Republic last April,
which were broken off in 1962.
