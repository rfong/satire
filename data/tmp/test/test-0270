``/`` I/PRP think/VBP everyone/NN realizes/VBZ that/IN when/WRB and/CC if/IN both/DT sides/NNS feel/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD come/VB back/RB ,/, then/RB we/PRP would/MD be/VB available/JJ ./.

And/CC I/PRP would/MD put/VB this/DT at/IN a/DT very/RB high/JJ priority/NN ,/, ''/'' Carter/NNP said/VBD during/IN a/DT briefing/NN on/IN this/DT week/NN 's/POS meeting/NN of/IN the/DT Carter/NNP Center/NNP 's/POS International/NNP Negotiation/NNP Network/NNP ./.

Bosnia/NNP was/VBD not/RB on/IN the/DT agenda/NN for/IN the/DT meeting/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ been/VBN the/DT top/JJ subject/NN recently/RB at/IN the/DT Carter/NNP Center/NNP ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Within/IN the/DT last/JJ two/CD weeks/NNS ,/, we/PRP 've/VBP probably/RB spent/VBN more/JJR time/NN on/IN Bosnia/NNP than/IN we/PRP have/VBP anything/NN else/RB ./. ''/''

Carter/NNP also/RB said/VBD that/DT :/: --/: No/DT agreement/NN for/IN dismantling/NNP North/NNP Korea/NNP 's/POS suspect/JJ nuclear/JJ program/NN will/MD succeed/VB unless/IN leaders/NNS of/IN North/NNP and/CC South/NNP Korea/NNP hold/VBP talks/NNS ./.

--/: Warring/NNP factions/NNS in/IN Sudan/NNP have/VBP honored/VBN for/IN more/JJR than/IN a/DT week/NN a/DT cease-fire/NN brokered/VBD by/IN Carter/NNP ./.

No/DT previous/JJ cease-fires/NNS have/VBP lasted/VBN more/JJR than/IN 24/CD hours/NNS ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ./.

In/IN Bosnia/NNP ,/, Carter/NNP negotiated/VBD a/DT cease-fire/NN in/IN December/NNP that/WDT was/VBD scheduled/VBN to/TO last/VB four/CD months/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP broke/VBD down/RP after/IN three/CD months/NNS when/WRB the/DT government/NN launched/VBD a/DT surprise/NN attack/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT response/NN of/IN the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNPS has/VBZ been/VBN moderate/JJ ,/, but/CC there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT danger/NN ,/, a/DT prediction/NN ,/, that/IN all-out/JJ war/NN is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO break/VB out/RP again/RB ,/, ''/'' Carter/NNP said/VBD ./.

Carter/NNP said/VBD he/PRP agreed/VBD with/IN the/DT theory/NN that/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN spring/NN contributed/VBD to/TO the/DT breakdown/NN in/IN Bosnia/NNP because/IN warmer/JJR weather/NN traditionally/RB prompts/VBZ an/DT escalation/NN in/IN fighting/VBG ./.

He/PRP also/RB attributed/VBD the/DT breakdown/NN to/TO disagreements/NNS within/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS group/NN that/WDT is/VBZ in/IN Bosnia/NNP to/TO monitor/VB the/DT conflict/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT contact/NN group/NN is/VBZ divided/VBN among/IN themselves/PRP ,/, ''/'' Carter/NNP said/VBD ./.

South/NNP Korea/NNP said/VBD Thursday/NNP it/PRP will/MD pull/VB out/RP of/IN a/DT deal/NN reached/VBN last/JJ October/NNP to/TO dismantle/VB North/NNP Korea/NNP 's/POS suspect/JJ nuclear/JJ program/NN by/IN April/NNP 21/CD unless/IN South/NNP Korean/NNP reactors/NNS are/VBP used/VBN as/IN replacements/NNS ./.

North/NNP Korea/NNP is/VBZ balking/VBG for/IN reasons/NNS of/IN pride/NN ,/, Carter/NNP said/VBD ./.

Carter/NNP helped/VBD broker/NN an/DT agreement/NN last/JJ June/NNP for/IN the/DT first-ever/JJ inter-Korea/JJ summit/NN ,/, but/CC plans/VBZ for/IN the/DT summit/NN were/VBD put/VBN on/IN hold/NN after/IN North/NNP Korean/NNP President/NNP Kim/NNP Il/NNP Sung/NNP died/VBD July/NNP 8/CD ./.

``/`` The/DT direct/JJ talks/NNS between/IN North/NNP and/CC South/NNP Korea/NNP are/VBP the/DT biggest/JJS unmet/JJ need/NN ''/'' in/IN solving/VBG the/DT nuclear/JJ conflict/NN ,/, Carter/NNP said/VBD ./.
