Hungarians Laszlo Ranga and Erno Buki drove a Ford Cosworth RS to

They also qualified to compete in other grade 10 and 20 races in the
European Rally Championships.
Twenty-eight of the crews, including John Gate and John Jackson of
Great Britain, abandoned the race before the finish due to difficult

the circuit in Romania's northeastern region of Maramures.
Ranga and Buki were followed by Bulgarians Gheorghi Petrov and Ivan
Tonev in a similar car, with Romanians Constantin Aur and Dumitru
Bobescu third in an Audi Quattro S-2.
