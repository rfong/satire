of areas, from arms control to aid donation, German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said today.
Visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and his German

broad diplomatic cooperation as well as wide-ranging economic and
scientific relations and cultural and youth exchanges.
They will also cooperate on regional affairs and aid provision.
