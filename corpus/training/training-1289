Six HK Stocks Predicted to Be Top Performers in 1997 
Six Hong Kong-based companies are picked up as the top global stocks
for 1997, according to a report released today by Salomon Brothers, one
of the leading U.S. investment banks.
In the 305-page report, titled "The Best the World Has to Offer: Our
Top Global Stock Picks for 1997," analysts of Salomon Brothers selected
119 stocks worldwide which they believe will perform well in 1997.
The six listings in Hong Kong are Guangnan Holdings Ltd., Dah Sing
Financial Holdings, Sing Tao Holdings, Hysan Development, COSCO Pacific
and Swire Pacific.
Both Guangnan and COSCO are Chinese-funded companies registered and
listed in Hong Kong. Guangnan, an authorized agent to import live and
fresh foodstuffs from the mainland into Hong Kong, is predicted to
experience steady growth in 1997 as high consumer spending drives food
stocks, says the report.
COSCO Pacific, primarily a container leasing and terminal operator, is
believed to take advantage of the wide use of containers in cargo
transport in China.
Dah Sing Financial Holdings is a strong recommendation among Hong Kong
banks that the report predicts a promising outlook for 1997.
Sing Tao Holdings, the publisher of a Chinese daily and an
English-language paper, is likely to benefit from fast-growing property
advertisements.
Hysan Development is a property investment company which is expected to
reap opportunities in the recovering office building market.
Swire Pacific fits broadly into six operating divisions -- property,
aviation, industry, trading, shipping and insurance.
Stephen L. Weiss, Salomon Brothers' global and U.S. equity research
product manager, expected the report to provide an overall strategy for
global institutional investors.
