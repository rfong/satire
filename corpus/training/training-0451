Nicaraguan City Masaya in Peril After Big Earthquake 
Intermittent earthquakes Saturday continue threatening the city of
Masaya in the southeast of Nicaragua after two strong tremors killed
seven people, injured more than 60, damaged 1,130 houses, and 4,512 had
to be taken out of their houses.
The most recent of these natural phenomena occurred Friday in Masaya,
30 kilometers southeast of Managua, at 18:19 local time ( 00:19 GMT)
and caused the death of three people, damaged eight houses and 90
people had to be taken to refuges.
But this city of 24,104 residents and famous for its handicrafts has
dozens of houses with cracked walls, which being old and built with
adobe and roofed with clay tiles, are dangerous for their inhabitants.
The 5.9 degrees on the Richter open scale seism occurred in the
northern bank of the Apoyo lagoon, at a depth of 500 meters, which was
a factor of the destruction caused.
Material damage has not been assessed in all its magnitude, and they
affected even two city graveyards, where the walls collapsed.
