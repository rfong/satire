Police Battle Anti-Nuclear Protesters 
Police used water cannon to dislodge hundreds of stone-throwing
anti-nuclear protesters trying to block the transport of radioactive
waste Tuesday in northern Germany.
Amid massive security by thousands of police, and protesters trying in
vain to block its progress, the transport of nuclear waste made its way
by rail across Germany on schedule.
About 6,500 police backed by helicopter-borne officers secured the
transport's voyage.
The contested transport triggered protests over several days. On
Monday, anti-nuclear protesters disrupted rail service around Frankfurt
by damaging power lines.
But the transport began as planned late Monday from the nuclear power
plant at Philippsburg, in southern Germany near Karlsruhe.
Police rode on the train carrying the special container with spent
nuclear fuel rods, while lines of running officers flanked the
transport as it pulled away slowly, surrounded by a throng of
protesters.
The 13-hour ride across four German states passed without incident, but
more protests marked the transport's arrival at its destination, the
train station in Dannenberg in northern Germany.
More than 200 protesters tried to block the rail line with burning
tires and hay, logs and other obstacles. Farmers with tractors also
blocked the rail line and roads in the area.
Police in riot gear used water cannon to remove the protesters. Flanks
of helmeted, shield-carrying officers secured the area as the transport
made its final leg of the journey by road from Dannenberg to nearby
Gorleben, where the nuclear waste will be stored in a new facility.
Local residents are vehemently opposed to the nuclear waste storage
site. Although the site is designated as temporary, anti-nuclear
activists say that since Germany has no permanent facilities, the
radioactive waste is likely to stay there indefinitely.
