Weapons buy-back program gets off to slow start
A scheme by US forces occupying Haiti to buy back guns from Haitians
has got off to a poor start with just 25 weapons handed over on the
first day, US officials said.
The "gourdes-for-guns" scheme, a reference to the Haitian currency, was
devised as a way of rooting out an arsenal of firepower believed to be
stocked in Port-au-Prince.
On offer was the Haitian currency equivalent of 50 dollars for small
handguns, and up to 300 dollars for heavy weapons.
But after one day, said US armed forces spokesman Colonel Barry Willey,
the meagre haul was 13 pistols, two sub-machine guns, six M1 rifles and
4 tear gas grenades.
One reason given for the poor reaction is that black-market prices for
guns in the violence-prone Haitian capital are several times higher
than what the US forces are offering.
But despite the lack of success, Willey said that the scheme will
continue to operate at the occupied former airbase of the Haitian
military.
"It's too early to judge the succes of the program, so we will be
continuing it for several weeks," Willey said.
