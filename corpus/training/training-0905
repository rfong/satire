Storm wreck oil threat to Ireland's famous dolphin 
Special anti-pollution measures were in place Monday off southwest
Ireland to ensure that oil leaking from a storm-damaged trawler does
not threaten a dolphin that has become one of the country's premier
tourist attractions, the marine ministry said on Monday.
The dolphin, named Fungie, has been living just outside the small
harbour of Dingle, County Kerry, since 1983.
More than 250,000 tourists are attracted to the town every year to go
out on boat trips to see and swim with Fungie.
Coastguards deployed an inflatable boom around the Spanish registered
trawler Celestial Dawn, which went aground in high winds Saturday just
after it left Dingle Harbour.
The 10 Spanish crewmen were airlifted to safety by a coastguard
helicopter.
"Some diesel oil did leak from the trawler before we got the boom in
place but we don't think it is enough to cause any problems for Fungie,
as it is evaporating very quickly," a marine ministry spokesman said.
"There are still 39,000 litres of diesel oil on board the trawler and
we plan to pump it off. Fungie is very important to Dingle so we are
anxious nothing goes wrong," he said.
"He is very inquisitive and has come to see what is going on. There is
a danger he could swim under the boom so we may use divers to try and
divert him away to play with them."
