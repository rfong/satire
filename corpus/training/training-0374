Nepal to Limit Vehicle Import to Euro-1 Standard 
Nepali Ministry of Population and Environment plans to forbid importing
motor vehicles that does not meet the Euro-1 standard in order to
improve the environmental situation in the country, the Kathmandu Post
on Saturday quoted a top ministry source as saying.
"We have submitted a proposal seeking to allow the import of only the
Euro-1 standard vehicles into the country from January 1, 2000," the
source said, hoping that the cabinet would endorse the proposal in its
upcoming meeting scheduled for next week.
Euro-1 emission norms had its genesis in Europe in the early 1990's.
The norms require vehicles to belch relatively low toxic gases than the
ordinary vehicles.
A diesel vehicle meeting the norms should not exceed carbon monoxide
emission of 2.72 grams, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide of 0.97 gram and
particulate matters of 0.14 grams per kilometer.
A petrol vehicle should not exceed 2.72 grams of carbon monoxide, 0.97
gram hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide gases per kilometer.
Confirming the report, Minister of Environment and Population Bhakta
Bahadur Balayar said that the government was intent on mandatorily
enforcing Euro-1 emission norms in the country to improve the
environmental situation.
In what was hailed as a bold decision, the Nepali government in
September banned diesel-operated and heavily polluting three- wheelers
from the Kathmandu Valley, followed up by banning the import of
two-stroke motorbikes into the country.
