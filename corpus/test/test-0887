Share Prices Fall Sharply in Tokyo 
Stock prices fell sharply in Tokyo Wednesday as opposition parties'
boycott to debate on a set of financial sector reform bills sparked the
possibility of more delays in putting an end to the country's bad loan
crisis.
The shares of Japan's 19 biggest banks all fell and a fistful of them
plummeted to new lows for the year.
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First Section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 206.90 points, or 1.37 percent, from
Tuesday's close to end at 14,866.03.
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all First
Section issues, dropped 15.37 points or 1.32 percent to 1,147.21.
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 400 million
shares from Tuesday's 360.54 million shares.
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) was the day's most heavily traded
issue.
Investors fled from bank shares on news that risky assets held by the
troubled LTCB totaled 2.82 trillion yen (about 19.5 billion U.S.
dollars) as of March 31, far greater than the 1.37 trillion yen (about
9.5 billion dollars) in problem and non-performing loans, the ailing
bank reported earlier this year.
Other banking issues also plummeted after the Democratic Party of Japan
and other opposition parties boycotted a Diet (parliament) committee
meeting to discuss six financial revitalization bills put forth by the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Of the 1,334 issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 937 to 217, with 123 issues remaining unchanged.
