Colombia's prosecutor calls for probe into president's campaign 
Colombia's attorney general called for a congressional investigation
Tuesday into charges that President Ernesto Samper was linked to the
use of drug money in his campaign last year.
Samper himself had called last Thursday for the probe by a committee in
the lower house, declaring that if any drug money were used in his
campaign, it was done so behind his back.
Tuesday he said he agreed with the decision by Attorney General Alfonso
Valdivieso to investigate the allegations linking him to the Cali
cocaine cartel.
Samper's former campaign treasurer, Santiago Medina, was arrested last
week and accused of accepting a 50,000 dollar check from a Cali cartel
front business.
Earlier, the prosecutor announced he was launching a probe into
allegations that Defense Minister Ferndando Botero, Samper's former
campaign manager, had accepted money from the powerful Cali cocaine
cartel in the 1994 election.
Valdivieso filed papers on Botero with the Supreme Court which has 10
days to review the merits of the case.
Sources from the attorney general's office said that testimony from
Medina after his arrest last week prompted the investigation against
Botero, the closest of Samper's aides.
The move deepens the crisis within the Samper government, which has
been embroiled in charges related to the influence of drug traffickers
in campaign financing.
Since Monday, when Medina' accusations were revealed, political
opposition leaders have said Botero should relinquish his post, and
have begun to question whether Samper should remain in office.
