Japanese PM Hashimoto: a man for all seasons 
Ryutaro Hashimoto, the 59-year-old head of the Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) who was re-elected as prime minister Thursday, will head Japan's
first all-conservative government in more three and a half years.
The LDP's two junior coalition partners since mid-1994, the left-wing
Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the centrist New Party Sakigake,
opted to stay out of the new cabinet following disastrous performances
in last month's elections.
But both parties signed parliamentary cooperation agreements with the
LDP last week and decided to support Hashimoto as prime minister,
enough to tilt the balance in favour of the LDP, which is still 12
seats short of a majority.
Hashimoto's re-election Thursday marks the LDP's full return to
Japanese power after it was thrown out of office in mid-1993, amid
widespread pubic disgust at growing numbers of corruption scandals.
Hashimoto was elected LDP leader in September last year and in January
took over the premiership from socialist prime minister Tomiichi
Murayama, who resigned suddenly during Japan's traditional New Year
break.
During the past nine months, he has presided over a gradual economic
recovery and managed to get support for a public liquidation scheme for
failed housing loan campanes, which were severely undermining the
financial system.
Hashimoto has also managed to put security ties with the United States
on a firmer footing and resolve a crisis involving opposition to US
bases in Okinawa, although many uncertainties remain.
Relations with China have been more problematic, strained by Chinese
nuclear testing and Hashimoto's decision to become the first prime
minister since 1985 to visit a controversial war shrine, partly
dedicated to class-A war criminals.
And in recent months, government inaction over a lighthouse built by
rightists on disputed islands also claimed by China has led to outright
Chinese criticism of Hashimoto and claims of a revival of militarism in
Japan.
Adored by many women for his slicked-back hair and fashionable suits,
the chain-smoking Hashimoto is described as one of the few politicans
capable of arguing on an equal footing with Japan's powerful
bureaucrats.
Born in 1937, he graduated from the elite Keio University, where he
majored in political science. He worked at a spinning company for two
years before entering parliament at the age of 26, following the death
of his father, Ryogo.
