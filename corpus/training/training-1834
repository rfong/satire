Polls close in Cameroon elections 
The polls closed Sunday in Cameroon where the West African state was
making a second try at parliamentary and local elections, a week after
a first attempt had to be scrubbed.
Some polling stations had to be kept open late to accommodate the flow
of voters, which increased steadily throughout the afternoon after a
relatively light turnout earlier.
One local polling station official said that the turnout only became
heavy after the football World Cup final, which in Cameroon as
elsewhere kept viewers glued to their screens.
The party of long-time President Paul Biya was expected to win easily.
Biya has held power since 1982 and is looking to maintain a comfortable
majority in the parliament.
