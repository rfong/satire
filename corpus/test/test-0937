Herbie Hide Confident He Can Beat Riddick Bowe 
Riddick Bowe thinks a win is a win, no matter how it is achieved.
The former undisputed heavyweight champion, however, might be bluffing
this time, especially if he's listened to veteran trainer Eddie Futch.
``I've told him this is the most important fight of his career because
of the politics involved in fighting today,'' Futch said of Bowe's
challenge to Herbie Hide of Britain for the WBO heavyweight title
Saturday night.
It's all part of the race for what Futch called ``that big prize'' -- a
match with Mike Tyson, who is scheduled to be released from prison
March 25.
A loss by Bowe, a 6-1 favorite, would wreck his career. An unimpressive
performance would hurt him in the Tyson sweepstakes.
``I told him, `I saw this guy fight and you are in for a tough
fight,''' Futch said.
The 23-year-old Hide, a native of Nigeria, has scored 25 knockouts in
winning all 26 of his pro fights, but he is expected to box against the
bigger Bowe.
``I have more boxing ability than Bowe,'' Hide said. ``I have more
everything that Bowe.''
He certainly doesn't have more experience against top-level opponents
than Bowe.
``The only advantage Bowe has is size,'' Hide said.
The 6-foot-5 Bowe weighed in officially Thursday at 241 pounds. The 6-2
Hide weighed 214 pounds.
``He's awkward and by being awkward he gives guys a lot of trouble,''
Bowe said. ``It will take me awhile to figure him out, but when I
figure him out, it's over.''
Bowe will be fighting for only the third time since he lost a 12-round
majority decision to Evander Holyfield in November 1993. Since then he
has had two fights called off because of injuries.
In his first comeback fight, Bowe hit Buster Matthis Jr. while he was
down. The fight last Aug. 13 at Atlantic City was stopped in the fourth
round, but instead of disqualifying Bowe the New Jersey commission
ruled the bout a no-contest.
Bowe boosted his record to 35-1, with 29 knockouts, when he easily
outpointed Larry Donald over 12 rounds Dec. 3 at Las Vegas.
Hide will be fighting for the first time since he won the WBO title by
knocking out Michael Bentt in the seventh round last March 19 at
London.
For his first fight in the United States, Hide will get $3.2 million.
Bowe will get $1 million for the bout to be televised by HBO, but if he
wins, he will get $10 million to fight Jorge Gonzalez, a Cuban living
in Las Vegas, June 17.
Gonzalez, 22-0, with 21 knockouts, will fight on Saturday night's card
against Bryan Scott. Scott has a 20-2 record, but was knocked out in
the second round by Derrick Roddy in his last fight last Nov. 21 at
Kansas City.
