Blair wants to host reception for England football squad 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair wants to host a reception forailed to
organise a formal welcome home.
England arrived back from Japan at London's Heathrow Airport late
Saturday where thousands of supporters greeted them following their 2-1
quarter-final defeat against Brazil.
But many fans only briefly saw their heroes before the players boarded
coaches to take them to a hotel.
"We do want to host a reception here to mark the achievements of the
team," said Blair's spokesman.
"We will obviously have to discuss this with the Football Association
to arrange a time which is convenient, bearing in mind the players have
obviously now gone off on holiday for a well-deserved break," he added.
England's Football Association (FA) was forced to justify its position
in not holding a formal reception when the team arrived back in
Britain, pointing to logistic and security difficulties.
Many fans wanted a public reception similar to that which greeted
Ireland's returning World Cup squad.
FA executive director David Davies denied the association had
deliberately snubbed fans, and told the BBC there were plans for a
formal welcome home for the team.
He added that it had not been decided when or where this might take
place.
Blair told a group of British reporters aho would ever have thought we
would have come this far?"
