Danish UN tank hit by Serb fire 
A Danish UN tank was hit by Serb tank fire Wednesday near the town of
Gradacac in northern Bosnia-Hercegovina, a UN spokesman said.
The Leopard tank was hit by a round fired by a Serb T-55 tank around
3:00 p.m. (1400 GMT) in the strategic Posavina corridor which links
Serb-held territory in northwestern Bosnia to Serbia proper, said Thant
Myint-U of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR).
The Danes fired back and were supported by two other Leopard tanks.
After the Danish riposte the Serb attack ended. No Danish injuries were
reported.
A total 10 Leopards have been deployed in the area under Danish UN
control.
The state-of-the-art Leopard was originally sent to Bosnia to protect
the airport of Tuzla, the second largest city under government control.
Its reopening had been expected earlier this year but it was ultimately
postponed indefinitely because of insecurity due to a Serb siege.
In April Danish tanks fired 75 rounds at Serb positions in a four hour
battle in the Vis mountains after coming under attack. The Danish
riposte left at least nine Serbs dead.
