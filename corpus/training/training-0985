Police Arrest 170 Left And Right Wing Demonstrators 
Police in this central Dutch city Saturday arrested 170 people for
trying to take part in banned left and right wing demonstrations.
It was the second weekend running that Dutch police had to make mass
arrests to prevent demonstrations by members of the extreme right CP
'86 party and counter demonstrations by their left wing opponents.
Last Saturday, police arrested about 170 people in the port city of
Rotterdam.
Utrecht police spokesman Jan Kramer said he did not know how many of
the arrested people were extreme right wingers.
No serious injuries were reported, he added.
About 150 police officers, including 80 riot police, were deployed to
make sure the demonstrations, outlawed earlier in the week by the
municipality, didn't take place.
Kramer said those arrested were not charged and would likely be freed
later Saturday.
