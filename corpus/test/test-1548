Sudan military claims capture of rebel base in oil regions 
Sudan's military claimed Friday it had captured a rebel-held airfield
in the country's main oil-producing region, two days after 17 civilians
were reportedly killed in a government helicopter raid, sparking an
international outcry.
"After continuous fierce fighting in (southern Sudan's) Wahda state the
army and militia were able to take control of the main base of the
rebels, and occupied the airport at Nial Diu," a statement quoted
military spokesman General Mohammed Bashir Suleiman as saying.
"The army captured a great deal of arms and equipment," the statement
said, without mentioning casualties on either side, nor when the
fighting had taken place.
"The rebel movement has recently continued attacks on army areas in
Wahda state in southern Sudan, continuously aiming at destroying oil
fields and stopping its production," the statement said.
Rebel attacks in the region began in February, following the conclusion
of an accord the previous month between the leader of the Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) John Garang and Riek Machar of the
Sudan People's Democratic Front, the statement said.
They included attacks on civilians working in the oil fields, the
statement said.
On Thursday, the army said in a statement read out on national radio
that accusations that it was deliberately targeting civilians were
"lies" put about by the SPLA.
Earlier on Thursday UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said 17 civilians had
been killed and many others wounded in a helicopter attack near a UN
food distribution outlet in southern Sudan.
"Helicopter gunships fired five rockets yesterday into an area adjacent
to a World Food Program (WFP) compound in the village of Bieh as people
had gathered to receive food assistance from WFP staff," Eckhard said.
Khartoum has yet to comment on the incident.
The United States suspended talks with the government on ending Sudan's
nearly 19-year-old civil war following the attack in the south of the
country and said they would not resume until Khartoum offered a full
explanation.
The United States had previously declared that it was "outraged" by
February 9 and 10 attacks by Sudan's air force that killed two children
in Bahr el-Ghazal State after a WFP food drop in the village of Akuem.
At the time, the United States said the attack had violated a pledge
made by Sudanese authorities in January to end bombings of civilian
targets for four weeks.
A day later, Khartoum expressed "profound regrets" over the bombing --
blaming it on a "technical error" -- and pledged that there would be no
repeat of the incident.
