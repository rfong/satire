Small quakes shake Japan 
Two small earthquakes shook eastern Japan early Thursday, but there
were no injuries or damage, the meteorological agency and local police
said.
A quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale occurred at 3:15 a.m. (18:15
GMT Wednesday) near Tori Island, one of the Izu chain of islands in the
Pacific and some 600 kilometres (370 miles) south of Tokyo, an agency
spokesman said.
The agency issued a caution against "tsunami" tidal waves for the Izu
islands and part of the mainland on the Pacific coast, but soon lifted
it after observing tsunami waves of up to 26 centimetres (eight
inches).
Earlier in the day, a smaller earthquake measuring 4.2 on the Richter
scale hit the Izu islands.
The epicentre of the quake, which occurred at 2:11 a.m. (17:11 GMT
Wednesday), was near Izu Oshima about 100 kilometres (62 miles) south
of Tokyo.
