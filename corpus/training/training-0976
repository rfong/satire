Clinton's envoy to Liberia heads to region for talks 
President Bill Clinton's special envoy to Liberia is headed to the
region to try to restore momentum to the peace process there, the White
House said Friday.
Ambassador Dane Smith was due to travel to West Africa Saturday for
consultations as "the United States is deeply concerned by the
continuing violence in Liberia and the lack of progress in implementing
the Abuja Peace Accord," said the statement by White House spokesman
Michael McCurry.
"Recent fighting in various parts of the country and increased weapons
flows into Monrovia and the countryside threaten the peace process,"
the statement said. "Thousands of innocent men, women and children
continue to fall victim to random factional violence."
"Despite initial promising signs, the Council of State in recent months
has failed to uphold its commitment to principles and guidelines agreed
in Abuja in August on disarmament, demobilization and timely holding of
national elections," it added.
"The factions have not disengaged and prepared for disarmament nor are
they presently cooperating with each other or with the West African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG). The United States calls upon all Liberians
to recommit themselves immediately to peace."
