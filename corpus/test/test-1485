Ekeus in mission to end standoff over missile parts
UN disarmament chief Rolf Ekeus was due to start a new mission to Iraq
here Sunday following a US warning that it would respond "firmly" to
any provocation.
But US officials said they would not prevent Iraq from resuming its
first oil exports in six years under a humanitarian deal with the
United Nations if Baghdad continued to block UN inspectors from
removing missile parts.
Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming
Iraq, was due to travel to Baghdad around noon Sunday (O900 GMT) after
arriving at the UNSCOM field office in Bahrain late Saturday, UN
officials said.
Ekeus, accompanied by Russian ballistics expert Nikita Smidovitch, is
due to meet Iraq's deputy prime minister Tareq Aziz during his four-day
trip.
Iraq expects to resume exports on Tuesday while Ekeus is here, although
UN officials have not given a date for the resumption. Ten UN experts
arrived in Iraq on Saturday to monitor the exports, the official INA
news agency said.
Iraqi authorities last month blocked the transfer to New York for
analysis of more than 70 parts, including engines, from a missile site
after allowing roughly 70 others to be moved to UNSCOM's Baghdad
monitoring center.
The remaining Scud parts are under UN surveillance at the missile site,
according to UN officials.
UN arms inspectors say the analysis would help verify the number of
missiles which Iraq claims to have destroyed unilaterally and establish
whether the parts are Russian- or home-made.
Ekeus suspects Iraq has retained between six and 16 Scud missiles like
the ones fired on Saudi Arabia and Israel during the 1991 Gulf war.
Ekeus said last month he sent a letter of protest to Baghdad and passed
a copy on to the president of the UN Security Council, "pointing out
that Iraq had violated its obligations" under UN resolutions ending the
1991 Gulf war.
The UN Security Council on Friday "expressed the hope that current
problems can be overcome" and called on Iraq to "cooperate fully with
the Special Commission."
Edward Gnehm, the number two at the US mission to the United Nations,
said that "this is a pattern of behaviour that we have seen before and
that we find inexcusable and inacceptable."
Iraq earlier this year blocked UN inspectors from inspecting suspected
weapons sites claiming the searches were a violation of its
sovereignty.
"We will respond firmly to Iraqi provocations," Gnehm stressed, warning
Iraq against making a "miscalculation" as to US intentions concerning
the lifting of UN sanctions.
Gnehm recalled that Iraq would remain under UN sanctions despite the
oil-for-food deal which is a temporary exemption to a crippling oil
embargo.
Under the resolutions adopted after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
the oil embargo can only be lifted when Iraq has complied with the UN
disarmament requirements.
These include the dismantling and destruction of all its missiles with
a range of more than 150 kilometres (93 miles).
