Ramirez's performance was an objest lesson in the traditional skills
encouraged by veteran coach Alcides Sagarra.
He danced around the ring in a swirl of ever-changing direction to
avoid his bewildered opponent before darting in with a combination of
ferocious punches that left the judges in no doubt as to who deserved
victory.
The Cuban's probable opponent in the light-fly final is Bulgarian
Daniel Petrov, the silver medallist in Finland, who moved into the last
four with a comfortable 8-2 points win over Poland's Adrezy Rzany.
Flyweight Raul Gonzalez sustained the Cuban medal assault early in the
second session when he brushed aside Neyman Vladislav despite taking a
count in the first round after the Israeli put him down with a
shuddering right upper cut.
Welterweight Juan Hernadez and his middleweight namesake, Ariel, both
set about the defence of the gold medals they won in 1993 without
serious threat to their progress.
But the most comprehensive Cuban victory was secured by light-middle
weight Alfredo Durvegel, the world number three, who showed Ukrainian
Oleg Kudinov little respect for a painfully one-sided 20-0 points
victory.
Welterweights Andeas Otto and Juan Hernandez will meet on Thursday in
one of four Cuban/German head-to-heads in the semi-finals.
Otto, the world number two, was never troubled in his 4-0 defeat of
Iranian Anushirvan Nourian while the Cuban set about the defence of his
title with victory by a similar margin to set up a repeat of the Sydney
final in 1991.
Lightweight Pablo Rojas, appearing in his first World Championships,
also guaranteed a bronze when he came through a ferocious encounter
with Italian Christian Giantomassi.
Light-welter Hector Vinent, the gold medallist two years ago, rounded
off a day of Cuban celebration with an easy 7-1 points win over Sergei
Bykowski.
It was also a good day for France, who continued their impressive run
of form with three out of four quarter-finalists securing bronze medals
to surpass the total of two medals they have won since the
championships were established 21 years ago.
