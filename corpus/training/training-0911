Construction of Science, Technology, Business Center Launched 
Construction work on a 800-million-yuan (96 million US dollars)
science, technology and business center began today in Xiamen, a
coastal city in southeast China's Fujian Province.
The project, which is jointly built by the State Science and Technology
Commission and the local government, is believed to be the second
facility of its kind in the country, after a similar one in Beijing, to
provide a wide-range science and technology information.
The center, covering a total floor space of 120,000 sq m, is expected
to be built within three years. Its first-phase construction is
estimated to cost some 150 million yuan (18 million US dollars). The
multi-purpose building will house offices, apartments, exhibition and
conference halls, markets and restaurants, and will provide
entertainment and services for tour in the coastal areas.
In addition, the commission has joined hands with the local government
in another two hi-tech projects locally, a hi-tech industrial
development zone and a science and technology development institute.
