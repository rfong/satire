Sri Lanka's Banks To Import Precious Metal 
Sri Lanka's state banks -- the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples' Bank --
have been authorized to import gold, silver and platinum on a duty free
basis, official sources said today.
They will be allowed to sell these metals to approved manufacturers of
jewelry who are direct or indirect exporters.
The import of gold to Sri Lanka was liberalized in June last year with
a duty of 10 percent and a turnover tax of 20 percent.
However, for manufacturers who exported items of jewelry, there were no
taxes on their import of gold.
Last year Sri Lanka exported gems worth 58 million US dollars, jewelry
worth 13 million US dollars and diamonds worth 1.1 billion US dollars.
