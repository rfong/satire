FIFA confirm 2002 World Cup Final for Tokyo
FIFA, world football's governing body, confirmed here on Saturday that
South Korea would host the opening match of the 2002 World Cup Finals while
co-hosts Japan would hold the Final.
The showpiece final will be held in Tokyo with the opening ceremony and
opening match in Seoul.
Details leaked out from the earlier meeting in November that Seoul
would host the opener while Japan would get the Final despite FIFA
putting a strict gag order on the two sides.
But within hours details were leaked.
The tournament will be known as 2002 World Cup Korea-Japan.
It was originally proposed to put Japan ahead of Korea in the title but
the Koreans dug their heels in and refused to budge.
Japanese hopes of having the number of teams in the final increased to
40 from the 32 that will take part in the 1998 World Cup in France was
also firmly rejected at November's meeting.
Japan also pleaded for the majority of matches but it was finally
agreed that both nations would have 16 games apiece.
