INTERPOL Calls Conference on Car Theft Insurance Fraud 
More than 30 countries will join an international conference on
insurance fraud and car theft in Sofia, Bulgaria in September, a
representative of the International Criminal Police Organization
(INTERPOL) said here Wednesday.
Hans Faleneger, of the General Secretariat of INTERPOL, said the
European Union, the United States and Canada will attend the conference
organized by INTERPOL and the Bulgarian government.
Leading world insurance agencies and insurers' associations are also
expected to attend, Faleneger said.
He said every year about 1.5 million to 1.6 million automobiles are
stolen in the EU, half of them just disappearing forever.
It is very difficult to detect stolen cars subject to insurance fraud,
he said. This was because an owner may sell a car to traffickers and
then report the "theft" to the local police.
In some countries such an owner is paid the insurance indemnity within
one month, he said.
Large insurance agencies have smoothly running machinery for tracing
such cars. Problems still exist, however, as the domestic legislation
of certain countries recognizes the status of an innocent purchaser.
Faleneger said INTERPOL decided to hold the conference in Sofia because
it appreciated the government's efforts and cooperation with the
organization to counter car theft.
Since December 1 last year, all used cars imported into Bulgaria have
been mandatorily checked against the wanted list, and INTERPOL gives
positive marks to the action by Sofia, Faleneger said.
Bulgaria also is one of 22 countries which have given INTERPOL access
to its data base on stolen automobiles, he said.
