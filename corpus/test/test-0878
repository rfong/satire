India asks Annan to restructure United Nations 
India urged UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan Saturday to keep the
interests of developing countries in mind while trying to restructure
the world body.
Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda told Annan here these "interests
must be taken fully into account in any changes in the structure and
functioning of the United Nations," an official said.
Deve Gowda also pleaded for India's inclusion in the UN Security
Council. India, the second most populous country, has been clamouring
for a seat in a reformed Security Council.
"India is the world's largest democracy and is a factor of stability in
international affairs," the prime minister was quoted as telling Annan
during their 30-minute meeting.
Anann, who arrived here early Saturday on a three-day visit, also met
Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma and External Affairs Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral. He is to address a ministerial meeting of the
Non-Aligned Movement here Monday.
The United News of India said Annan told Deve Gowda that he favoured
"continued close cooperation between India and the United Nations" and
also praised New Delhi's commitment to the world body.
Annan is on a two-week tour to India, Switzerland, Italy and Germany.
