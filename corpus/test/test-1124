China to Be ASEAN's Full Dialogue Partner in July 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has welcomed the
news that China will become its full dialogue partner in July, a
Chinese official attending the second China-ASEAN senior officials'
consultations said here today.
Vice foreign ministers and permanent secretaries of the seven ASEAN
members as well as ASEAN Secretary General Ajit Singh attended the
two-day consultations that ended today.
According to the Chinese official, ASEAN said China's becoming a full
dialogue partner will promote the all-round development of relations
between the two sides.
He said the two sides achieved extensive common ground after exchanging
views on bilateral relations, regional situation and security
environment.
The two sides agreed that the consultations would be of great
significance to the promotion of their mutual understanding and
cooperation as the region continues to enjoy stability and rapid
economic growth and sees the strengthening of the trend towards
multipolarity.
They expressed satisfaction over the smooth development of friendly
relations and cooperation between China and ASEAN in recent years and
their effective coordination and cooperation on international and
regional affairs.
"The two sides agreed that the shared interests between China and ASEAN
far exceed their differences," the official noted.
The Chinese side also showed its readiness to establish, in conjunction
with ASEAN, a partnership of good-neighborly and mutual trust oriented
towards the 21th century, he said.
The two sides demonstrated their commitment to work unremittingly for
the long-term and continued development of China-ASEAN relations.
Officials participating in the consultations reviewed and looked
forward into perspective of their cooperation in economic, science and
technology and cultural fields.
Statistics showed that China-ASEAN trade reached nearly 20 billion US
dollars in 1995, a growth of 40 percent over 1994, illustrating the
tremendous potential and a bright prospect of economic cooperation
between the two sides.
The consultations were co-chaired by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan and Director General for Political Affairs of Indonesian
Foreign Ministry H.E. Izhar Ibrahim.
