Shuttle crew loses Italian satellite 
The Italian tethered satellite that astronauts hoped to deploy this
weekend broke loose and was speeding away from the space shuttle
Columbia, NASA said Sunday.
NASA spokesman Steve Nesbitt said there was no chance of recovering the
440 million dollar satellite, which had almost been fully extended on
its thin cable, but told AFP neither the shuttle nor its crew were at
risk.
"There is no danger of it coming in contact with the shuttle again,"
Nesbitt said.
The cable snapped as the crew was nearly finished paying out the
22-kilometer-long (12.5-mile) Italian Tethered Satellite System (TSS).
"It immediately began accelerating rapidly after having separated,"
Nesbitt said. He estimated its speed at 160 kilometers per hour (100
miles).
The satellite experiment was being conducted to see whether dragging
the apparatus and its cable through a magnetic field could generate
electricity.
