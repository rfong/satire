Eurotunnel says warning light indicated jack malfunction
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel Wednesday corrected a detail of a
report that said a fire in the rail link caused far more damage than it
should have because a faulty warning light told the driver to stop his
blazing train.
Eurotunnel said here that a red light that came on after the fire broke
out in the tunnel last month indicated hydraulic jacks normally used to
stabilise wagons when being loaded with road trucks were down, implying
a risk of derailment.
It said the warning light, which should not have come on, did not
indicate that a metal plate had fallen off, as the London Daily
Telegraph reported on Wednesday.
Eurotunnel said that the driver's instructions were to stop the train
and inspect it if the warning light came on, but to take the train out
of the tunnel as quickly as possible if there was a fire.
The Telegraph said that if the driver had observed normal safety rules
and carried on to Folkestone at the English side of the link, the fire
would not have reached the intensity inside the tunnel which generated
so much damage.
Eurotunnel already said last month that the warning light might have
switched on because wiring melted in high temperatures.
Thirty-four people were taken to hospital, eight suffering from smoke
inhalation, after the November 18 fire.
Eurotunnel's car shuttle service between Folkestone and Calais resumed
on December 10 and Eurostar passenger trains linking London with Paris
and Brussels a week earlier.
Freight trains are also running again between the French and British
railway systems, but not Eurotunnel's freight shuttles.
