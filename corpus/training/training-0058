Business Closures in Thailand Increase 
The economic downturn and cash flow problems forced 5,078 companies out
of business in Bangkok and adjoining areas last year, 20 percent more
than in 1996, according to a report issued by the Thai Commerce
Ministry available here Wednesday.
Although figures had yet to come in, about 1,000 provincial businesses
were believed to have been shut down, resulting in an average 10
percent increase nationwide in closures.
The report said those dissolved including transport, construction,
retailing, export and import businesses and beauty clinics.
