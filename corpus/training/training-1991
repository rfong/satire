India condemns US journalist Daniel Pearl's killing 
India on Friday condemned the killing of US journalist Daniel Pearl by
Islamic militants in Pakistan terming it "a crime and an act of
terror."
"It is a tragedy, "Indian foreign ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao
told reporters in the Indian capital.
Pearl's "murder is a crime and an act of teror that we wholeheartedly
condemn," Rao said.
The "brutal and senseless murder" had again "drawn attention to the
criminal forces of terror that continue to operate on Pakistani
territory and who continue to pursue their agenda of mindless violence
and hatred and who have received support and safe haven in Pakistan,"
she said.
Pearl, 38, was kidnapped on January 23, after going to interview little
known militant leader Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani as part of a story on the
murky underworld of Islamic extremism in Pakistan.
The kidnappers' trail went cold after the last of two e-mails was sent
to news organisations last month, containing pictures of the reporter
in chains with a gun pointed at his head.
On Friday, the US State Departement confirmed that a grisly videotape
had been delivered to the US consulate in teh Pakistani southern port
city of Karachi which showed two kidnappers beheading the Wall Street
Journal correspondent.
Rao said the killing proved beyond doubt "that there is a problem in
Pakistan ... that rooting out of the problem has not been completed,"
Rao said.
Last month, Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf in a landmark
address to the nation, banned five Islamic militant groups based there
and arrested about 2,000 alleged religious extremists.
Pakistan police have arrested a British-born Islamic militant known as
Sheikh Omar, who is suspected of orchestrating Pearl's kidnapping.
Omar was one of three jailed militants released by India in December
1999, in exchange for hostages aboard a hijacked Indian Airlines
flight.
