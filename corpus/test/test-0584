Yemen broke Hanish Islands pact: Eritrean envoy 
The Eritrean ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Mohammad Omar
Mahmud, accused Yemen on Friday of a violation of the bilateral
arbitration accord over the Hanish Islands in the Red Sea.
Earlier Yemen said the arbitration of the dispute, agreed through
French mediation Wednesday, would be limited to the island of Hanish
al-Kabir (Greater Hanish).
"The Yemeni republic welcomes the accord on the principles of the
arbitration, aimed at solving peacefully the conflict on the Yemeni
island of Greater Hanish," said an official statement published by the
SABA news agency.
But Mahmud told AFP: "That is a clear violation of the accord on the
principles of arbitration which has not even been signed yet."
He insisted that "the two countries have undertaken not to make
statements about the disputed area which needs to be defined by the
arbitration court."
Since Eritrean forces captured the main island of Hanish al-Kabir from
Yemen in December, Asmara has insisted that discussions should centre
on all nine islands in the archipelago.
Sanaa says they should be limited to Hanish al-Kabir.
Eritrean Deputy Foreign Minister Saleh Kikia told Radio France
Internationale on Friday that "the first task of this (special) court
is to define the area of conflict between the two countries after
hearing both sides' point of view."
The islands, which guard the Bab al-Mandab straits at the southern
entrance to the Red Sea, used to be part of the Ottoman Empire and
their status has never been settled by international convention.
