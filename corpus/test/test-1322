Henderson, Sino Land win bidding in government's first land auction 
Two leading property developers, Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd.
and Sino Land Co. Ltd., won the bidding for two lots Wednesday at the
government's first land auction for the 1996-1997 financial year.
Henderson Land acquired a 21,200 square metre (228,112 square foot)
site at Tai Po in the New Territories for 535 million Hong Kong dollars
(69.2 million US), with the bidding for the site starting at 380
million dollars.
The Tai Po site is intended for residential purposes.
Sino Land acquired a 276 square metre (3,522 square foot) residential
site in Shek O on southern Hong Kong island from the government for 17
million dollars. The bidding started at 12 million dollars.
Analysts said the prices were above market expectations.
Some 50 villagers from Shek O village, known for its beaches, held a
peaceful protest against the auctioneering of the site which they said
was "illegal" as it encroached into their properties.
Sino Land's Robert Ng, the buyer, said he bought the site "in good
faith," adding the government must resolve the dispute.,
Henderson and Sino Land were active in recent years in expanding their
land holdings ahead of the territory's handover to China in July next
year.
At the last land auction for the 1995-1996 financial year in March,
Henderson paid 4.725 billion dollars in a joint venture with Sun Hung
Kai to acquire a prime property site in a newly-reclaimed area of over
15,000 square metres (161,400 square feet) earmarked for non-industrial
use in Hung Hom.
Sino Land also acquired a similar sized plot in the central business
district for 765 million dollars in a joint venture with South China
group.
Sino Land also got a similar sized plot in the east of Hong Kong island
for 440 million dollars.
Shares of Henderson Land roe 50 cents to close at 59.00 dollars, while
Sino Land was unchanged to close at 7.95 dollars.
