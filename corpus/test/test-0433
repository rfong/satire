Thousands of Moslems vow to march on gutted Kashmir town
Tens of thousands of Kashmiri Moslems vowed on Wednesday to march on a
holy town ravaged by a devastating fire and under siege by the Indian
army for two months.
Up to 50,000 people pledged at a demonstration called by Moslem
separatist groups to march Friday on the holy town of Charar-i-Sharief,
where some 500 homes were gutted in a blaze on Tuesday.
The protestors shouted anti-Indian slogans and vowed to break through a
security cordon set up around Charar-i-Sharief, which houses the tomb
of an 18th century Moslem cleric and a revered mosque.
Moslem militants holed up in the town nearly 40 kilometers (25 miles)
from here since March 8 accused Indian troops of causing the blaze. The
army said the militants set the fire so they could escape.
A police superintendent said, however, the fire was started
accidentally during an exchange of gunfire between Moslem separatist
guerrillas and the thousands of Indian troops who have surrounded the
town.
The Indian army said some 500 houses, 100 shops and a dozen warehouses
were destroyed. Unofficial sources said five people died in the fire
but there has been no official confirmation of deaths.
Indian officials said the mosque and tomb of Sheikh Nooruddin
Nooranisufi were not damaged.
Indian troops partially lifted the siege of the sacred town on
Wednesday allowing journalists and residents to go into
Charar-i-Sharief, where smoke continued to billow from the debris of
gutted homes.
More than half of the 35,000 residents have fled since the army siege
began on March 8.
Several political leaders of the Kashmiri separatist movement were
taken into custody on Tuesday when security forces broke up attempts to
march on Charar-i-Sharief.
The huge fire coincided with attempts by the Indian authorities to
organise the first state government elections in Kashmir since the
Moslem rebellion got underway in 1989.
Separatist groups have called for a boycott of the polls scheduled to
be held before mid-July to replace central rule by New Delhi.
More than 11,000 people have died in Kashmir since Moslem militants
launched a secessionist campaign in India's only Moslem-majority state.
