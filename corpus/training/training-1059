China to Complete Experimental Fast Neutron Reactor Project in 2005 
China's experimental fast neutron breeder reactor plant, which is 100
times more efficient in producing nuclear fuel than mainstream nuclear
plants, is set to be completed by 2005, according to a nuclear expert.
Wang Zhou, technical adviser to the project, said that, at the
completion of the experimental plant, commercial production of nuclear
fuel by the more efficient fast neutron breeder reactor will not be far
off.
The type of reactor is capable of turning uranium 238, which
constitutes 99.7 percent of the natural uranium ore, into nuclear fuel,
said Wang, who came back in 1982 to China from France following more
than 30 years of studying and working on nuclear energy.
But the mainstream reactors, like those used in Qinshan Nuclear Power
Plant in Zhejiang province and Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in south
China's Guangdong province, are able to use only uranium 235, which
constitutes a mere 0.07 percent of the natural uranium ore, he said.
Wang said his proposal to build an experimental fast neutron reactor
was later adopted as part of China's high-tech program.
The reactor project has been promised a total funding of 700 million
yuan by the central government, said Wang.
Commercial fast neutron breeder reactor plants are expected to be
operational very soon in France and the United States.
It would take half a century for China to catch up with Europe and the
United States in this field, he said.
