We spent 12 days in our Zodiac: Greenpeace militant 
Greenpeace activist David McTaggart said on arriving here Wednesday
that he had spent almost two weeks in an inflatable boat near the
French nuclear test site in the South Pacific.
"We spent 12 days in our Zodiac to test the vigilance of the French
army," McTaggart told reporters Wednesday. (EDS THURSDAY AHEAD OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DATELINE)
McTaggart and two other activists from the environmental group were
last seen July 10, when the French navy seized Greenpeace's flagship
Rainbow Warrior II, which had entered the military exclusion zone at
Mururoa atoll.
French commandos boarded the Greenpeace ship to stop it reaching the
Mururoa base, while the three activists slipped away in Zodiacs.
McTaggart, one of the founders of the Greenpeace movement, arrived in
Tahiti aboard his yacht, Vega, after travelling 1,500 kilometers (600
miles) from Vanavana atoll, near Mururoa, where he was picked up Friday
by the French navy.
The Greenpeace militant said he had stopped off at Vanavana "to take on
water."
"For me our operation has been a success," McTaggart said, "because the
French army was incapable of finding us."
Greenpeace has repeatedly said the three activists had secretly entered
the exclusion zone and were hiding on the atoll.
McTaggart said he had come to Papeete to help organize a peace flotilla
which he plans to lead to Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls at the end of
August.
"Our goal is to surround the two atolls and I will encourage sailors in
the flotilla to enter (French) territorial waters. Then we will see if
the French navy can stop us," he said.
An announcement by French President Jacques Chirac that France would
resume nuclear testing in September in the South Pacific set off a
storm of protest from Pacific nations and a host of environment groups.
