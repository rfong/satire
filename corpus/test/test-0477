"Let Presidents of Multinationals Know Rapidly Developing China"
"The '99 Fortune Forum will open in Shanghai in several days and will draw
the attention of the whole world."
In an interview with Xinhua, John S. Needham, president of the Fortune
Conference Division, said, "It is China's rapidly developing economy
that has attracted the attention of the presidents of world's great
multinationals."
Each year, Fortune magazine ranks the world's top 500 enterprises and
chooses the city with the most vigorous economy in which to hold their
global forum, according to Needham.
He said the Shanghai Forum, with the theme "China -- The Next 50
Years," will enable multinational executives to learn more about China,
which is now experiencing "a magic change" and bringing about huge
commercial opportunities.
Needham predicts that these giant enterprises will greatly increase
their investment in China over the next few years, especially in the
country's insurance, aviation, and hotel sectors.
In addition to government officials and economists, most of the 200
Chinese representatives attending the forum are entrepreneurs who
expect to have cooperative talks with their foreign counterparts.
"They are here as participants rather than as observers," Needham
noted.
He also expressed his satisfaction with the way Shanghai has organized
the event.
"The Shanghai International Conference Center, the major venue for the
Forum, was built quickly, and the new Pudong Airport has also gone into
operation. The municipality's infrastructure also has been perfected.
As it further improves its services, Shanghai will certainly become one
of the world economic centers, like Hong Kong and Singapore," Needham
added.
Needham has been kept busy ever since coming to Shanghai in January.
"I've been too excited to get much sleep, organizing such an important
conference," he said with a sense of humor.
