Man's best friend to go mine sweeping
The US contingent in Bosnia has brought in a pack of dogs specially
trained in sniffing out mines to try and lessen the hazard posed by
millions of such devices strewn around the former Yugoslav republic, a
spokesman said Thursday.
Staff Sergeant Thomas Ellis said in all 14 dogs were flown into Bosnia
on Friday to root out mines and other anti-personnel and anti-tank
devices.
Ellis, who himself looks after an eight-year-old Belgian Malanois
currently undergoing a 20-week training programme for the potentially
hazardous occupation, said the animals would only be used in fields
already marked as having been cleared of mines.
"Our goal is to make Bosnia safe for all," he said.
The initiative comes after a series of mine incidents which culminated
in the first death of a US soldier in Bosnia last Saturday.
The peace Implementation Force (IFOR) is still looking into the exact
circumstances which led to the death of Sergeant First Class Donald A.
Dugan near a checkpoint at Gradacac, 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of
this northeast Bosnian city.
On Wednesday an IFOR spokesman said Dugan had died as a result of
massive head injuries sustained in an explosion, but stressed the
soldier did not step on a mine.
