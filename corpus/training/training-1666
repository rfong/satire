Australian Researchers Welcome Innovation Plan
Head of the Australian Research Council Vicki Sara said in a statement
that "The government is sending a clear message to our best and
brightest researchers that their ideas and skills are crucial to
innovation and therefore Australia's future. It provides strong and
appropriate incentives and increased opportunities to not only stop the
so-called brain drain, but reverse it."
According to the Australian Associated Press (AAP), the Australian
Geoscience Council said Backing Australia's Ability plan was an
important step to ensure Australia could participate in high-technology
industry.
AAP quote president of the council David Denham as saying that "We need
strong government leadership in the science and technology sector to
avoid complete domination by overseas multinationals and to ensure that
Australia is recognized as much more than a country that trains good
athletes and provides cheap, relaxing vacations."
The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies
described the plan as a landmark increase in national investment.
President of the federation Sue Serjeantson said in a statement that
"We have re-entered the race to be internationally competitive, this is
a great start. It drives home the message that science means business."
Prime Minister John Howard announced Monday a 2.9 billion Australian
dollar (about 1.58 billion U.S. dollars) package plan to boost research
and development in five years. The plan promised hundreds of millions
of dollars for the research.
AAP said the funding boost was much more than researchers had expected.
For example, the Australian Research Council expected to fund an extra
600 million Australian dollars (about 326 million U. S. dollars) while
Howard injected 736 million Australian dollars (about 400 million U.S.
dollars), doubling its existing funding by 2005-2006.
