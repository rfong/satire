Pak, Indian Lawmakers Call for Negotiated Settlement 
Lawmakers of Pakistan and India Friday called for a negotiated
settlement of bilateral disputes between the two countries.
They made the call at the first Indo-Pak Parliamentary Conference which
started here Friday and was attended by about 100 delegates from the
two countries.
"Problems could not be solved through use of force," said Ehali Bakhsh
Soomro, Speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly, stressing the need for
the settlement of disputes through dialogue.
Leader of the Indian delegation Balram Jakbar said that the two
countries should avoid bloodshed and settle differences through talks,
saying "we should talk against war and for the promotion of peace."
Pakistani Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Yasin Khan Watto
reiterated Pakistan's call for the peaceful solution to the Kashmir
issue, saying that without the settlement of the core issue, the goal
of progress in other fields could not be achieved.
However, the Indian members of parliament called for settlement of
minor issues first to create better environment for negotiations on key
disputes.
Meanwhile, the lawmakers from both countries lauded what they called
genuine efforts by the two governments to improve relations between the
two countries.
They welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's
forthcoming visit to Pakistan on February 20 and the proposed bus
service from New Delhi to Pakistan's second biggest city of Lahore.
They hoped that these measures will reduce tension between the two
countries and result in better mutual understanding.
Some 35 lawmakers members from the two houses of the Indian parliament,
including those from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the main
opposition Congress Party, and more than 60 members from all the
parties in the Pakistani parliament are participating the two-day
conference aiming at giving impetus "towards detente in the
sub-continent."
