First/NNP ANC/NNP finance/NN minister/NN prepares/VBZ tight/JJ South/NNP African/NNP budget/NN South/NNP Africa/NNP 's/POS first/JJ finance/NN minister/NN to/TO come/VB from/IN the/DT ranks/NNS of/IN the/DT governing/NNP African/NNP National/NNP Congress/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- ANC/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO balance/VB priorities/NNS when/WRB he/PRP presents/VBZ his/PRP$ budget/NN to/TO parliament/NN on/IN Wednesday/NNP ./.

Finance/NNP Minister/NNP Trevor/NNP Manuel/NNP ,/, who/WP succeeded/VBD independent/JJ Chris/NNP Liebenberg/NNP a/DT year/NN ago/IN ,/, is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO honor/VB a/DT promise/NN by/IN President/NNP Nelson/NNP Mandela/NNP at/IN the/DT recent/JJ opening/NN of/IN parliament/NN that/IN this/DT will/MD be/VB the/DT year/NN when/WRB previous/JJ pledges/NNS are/VBP implemented/VBN ./.

But/CC he/PRP was/VBD also/RB expected/VBN to/TO follow/VB the/DT financial/JJ orthodoxy/NN laid/VBN down/RP by/IN the/DT ANC-led/JJ government/NN which/WDT came/VBD to/TO power/NN in/IN May/NNP 1994/CD with/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT apartheid/NN system/NN of/IN white/JJ minority/NN rule/NN ./.

In/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT government/NN 's/POS reconstruction/NN and/CC development/NN program/NN ,/, designed/VBN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT effects/NNS of/IN the/DT glaring/VBG racial/JJ inequalities/NNS of/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, more/JJR money/NN will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB spent/VBN on/IN housing/NN ,/, health/NN and/CC education/NN in/IN particular/JJ ./.

According/VBG to/TO official/JJ sources/NNS ,/, a/DT total/NN of/IN 4.4/CD billion/CD rands/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 990/CD million/CD dollars/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- will/MD be/VB injected/VBN in/IN these/DT areas/NNS ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN large/JJ cuts/NNS are/VBP planned/VBN in/IN defense/NN spending/NN for/IN the/DT second/JJ year/NN running/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN in/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN other/JJ public/JJ services/NNS ./.

But/CC as/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP faces/VBZ a/DT severe/JJ crime/NN wave/NN ,/, the/DT government/NN wants/VBZ to/TO revamp/VB the/DT police/NN and/CC justice/NN departments/NNS before/IN making/VBG more/JJR money/NN available/JJ to/TO them/PRP ./.

For/IN the/DT new/JJ tax/NN year/NN beginning/VBG at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN March/NNP economists/NNS are/VBP forecasting/VBG expenditure/NN of/IN 186/CD billion/CD rands/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 42/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC revenue/NN of/IN 163/CD billion/CD rands/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 36.6/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

This/DT is/VBZ in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT four-percent/JJ deficit/NN laid/VBN down/RP in/IN the/DT government/NN 's/POS broad/JJ economic/JJ strategy/NN up/RB to/TO the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT century/NN ,/, In/IN a/DT recent/JJ interview/NN Manuel/NNP said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD confident/JJ of/IN reaching/VBG this/DT target/NN ,/, without/IN having/VBG recourse/NN to/TO the/DT large/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN cash/NN coming/VBG from/IN the/DT extensive/JJ privatisation/NN program/NN now/RB under/IN way/NN ./.

A/DT general/JJ increase/NN in/IN the/DT 14-percent/JJ value/NN added/VBD tax/NN is/VBZ unlikely/JJ ,/, amid/IN fears/NNS expressed/VBN by/IN the/DT government/NN 's/POS trade/NN union/NN allies/NNS that/IN it/PRP would/MD hit/VB the/DT poor/JJ hardest/RBS ./.

However/RB a/DT rise/NN of/IN the/DT tax/NN on/IN cigarettes/NNS or/CC alcohol/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN ,/, despite/IN a/DT developing/VBG black/JJ market/NN in/IN both/DT products/NNS ,/, and/CC on/IN motor/NN fuel/NN ./.

Manuel/NNP could/MD also/RB introduce/VB a/DT land/NN tax/NN and/CC a/DT capital/NN gains/NNS tax/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ recalled/VBN that/IN the/DT government/NN has/VBZ had/VBN problems/NNS collecting/VBG a/DT tax/NN introduced/VBN last/JJ year/NN on/IN interest/NN accumulated/VBN by/IN pension/NN funds/NNS ./.

To/TO try/VB to/TO increase/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN tax/NN collected/VBD the/DT revenue/NN service/NN is/VBZ recruiting/VBG a/DT thousand/CD more/RBR staff/NN and/CC a/DT law/NN giving/VBG it/PRP more/JJR autonomy/NN will/MD be/VB introduced/VBN this/DT year/NN ./.

Experts/NNS have/VBP commented/VBD that/IN reform/NN of/IN the/DT service/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN ./.

Taxpayers/NNPS meanwhile/RB are/VBP hoping/VBG for/IN a/DT repetition/NN of/IN last/JJ year/NN 's/POS cut/NN in/IN income/NN tax/NN for/IN those/DT at/IN the/DT lower/JJR end/NN of/IN the/DT income/NN scale/NN ./.

But/CC companies/NNS fear/VBP that/IN a/DT 12.5-percent/JJ tax/NN on/IN dividends/NNS will/MD be/VB maintained/VBN ,/, and/CC even/RB that/IN the/DT exemption/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO general/JJ expenses/NNS will/MD be/VB abolished/VBN ./.

Pressure/NN is/VBZ increasing/VBG for/IN a/DT removal/NN of/IN exchange/NN controls/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT government/NN has/VBZ the/DT support/NN of/IN the/DT International/NNP Monetary/NNP Fund/NNP in/IN avoiding/VBG anything/NN drastic/RB ./.

The/DT governor/NN of/IN the/DT central/JJ bank/NN ,/, Chris/NNP Stals/NNP ,/, recently/RB suggested/VBD that/IN indviduals/NNS might/MD be/VB allowed/VBN to/TO open/VB accounts/NNS in/IN foreign/JJ currency/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN those/DT who/WP leave/VBP South/NNP Africa/NNP should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO take/VB their/PRP$ money/NN with/IN them/PRP ./.

For/IN many/JJ analysts/NNS this/DT fiscal/JJ year/NN will/MD be/VB a/DT test/NN of/IN the/DT ANC/NNP 's/POS capacity/NN to/TO govern/VB on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, following/VBG the/DT decision/NN last/JJ June/NNP of/IN the/DT former/JJ ruling/NN National/NNP Party/NNP to/TO go/VB into/IN opposition/NN ./.

The/DT National/NNP Party/NNP was/VBD the/DT ANC/NNP 's/POS junior/JJ partner/NN in/IN a/DT coalition/NN government/NN from/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT present/JJ dispensation/NN in/IN 1994/CD ,/, and/CC initially/RB held/VBD the/DT finance/NN ministry/NN ./.
