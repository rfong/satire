Hussein's Militia Tightens Siege on Rivals
Faction soldiers loyal to Somali warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid today
tightened the siege on the positions of another warlord Ali Mahdi
Mohamed in North Mogadishu's Medina neighborhood.
Residents in Medina said the militiamen who surrounded the district
were confiscating goods and personal belongings, especially food and
fuel, of traders from the district.
The confiscated goods were collected at one point just behind a
blockade erected by the gunmen, and were transported to the Bakara
market in South Mogadishu for sale, said an eyewitness.
According to one of the militiamen who declined his name, the strict
siege on Medina will continue for at least a week.
The reason behind the encirclement is not yet known. Nor did the
administration of Hussein Aidid, son of the late Somali warlord Mohamed
Farah Aidid, make any statement about the new action taken by the
militiamen.
Medina neighborhood has been a focal point for Mogadishu's factional
fighting until late General Aidid died 49 days ago. From then on, there
has been a standstill between the soldiers loyal to Hussein Aidid and
Ali Mahdi, but fighting broke out occasionally.
