US calls for restraint, awaits report on electoral fraud 
Stating that violence has no place in a democracy, the United States
Thursday called for restraint in Armenia where post-electoral violence
has flared amid allegations of fraud.
The State Department also said that it was awaiting the results of a
report prepared by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) on alleged fraud in the September 22 presidential
election.
"The United States is concerned about OSCE reports of these
irregularities and awaits the OSCE's final assessment," spokesman Glyn
Davies said.
Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian won Sunday's poll with 52.09
percent of the vote, according to the Armenian electoral commission.
But four members issued a dissenting statement, saying that opposition
candidate Vazgen Manukian had won 60 percent of the vote, prompting
Manukian supporters to take to the streets on Wednesday.
Demonstrators, accusing Ter-Petrossian of rigging the election, stormed
the parliament and beat up the speaker, Babken Ararktsian.
"It is regrettable and unfortunate that the opposition forces resorted
to violence yesterday, including the storming of the parliament
building," Davies said. "Violence has no place in a democracy."
"The United States condemns acts of political violence and calls upon
all involved to exercise restraint," he added.
