Emperor of Japan to Dine At Heathrow
Emperor Akihito and his Mrs are to dine with the Queen and Prince
Philip when they visit the country on Sunday 27 May.
The royal chefs are a little concerned on how to serve the meal.
"We are not sure if we should sit them on stools and serve it on a
conveyer belt system. The only conveyer system near to us is at
Heathrow."
Baggage handlers at Heathrow said that they will be demanding overtime
if they were required to provide baggage and sushi dishes.
"Karaoke is out of the question. The last time Prince Philip did a
Karaoke, he was a bit mullered on cider and couldn't remember the words
to Houndog. The Queen put in a sterling performance on backing vocals."
Airport officials have warned that there may be some delays on flights
to and from south east Asia.
