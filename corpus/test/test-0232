Lebanon Pledges Clampdown on Illegal Immigration 
Lebanese government has decided to clamp down on illegal immigration to
Cyprus and cooperate with the island in this effort.
The government has informed Cyprus of its decision and said it would
not allow anyone to use Lebanon as a transit point to illegally enter
the Mediterranean island, about 200 kilometers off Lebanon's coast.
The problem between Cyprus and Lebanon surfaced last week after Cypriot
police stopped a bid to smuggle 29 illegal immigrants on board a
Lebanese ship, Mustafa, a diplomatic source told the Daily Star.
Cypriot authorities notified Lebanon that the ship had set sail from
its northern port city of Tripoli and asked it to take back those
illegal immigrants.
Beirut rejected the demand, however, saying it could only take in six
Egyptians who held Lebanese residency cards.
Cyprus then took back the rest 23 immigrants who were later sentenced
to prison terms of up to 45 days for entering the country illegally.
The incident strained normally close ties between the two countries.
