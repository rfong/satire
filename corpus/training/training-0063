Three die of salmonella bug in Glasgow hospital 
Three men have died after contracting salmonella while in a Glasgow
hospital, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
Health authorities are investigating the deaths of the men, who were
being treated on an all-male ward at the Victoria Infirmary in the
city.
Another male patient also contracted the bug, but the hospital refused
to reveal details of his condition.
"We are deeply upset that this has happened, and our thoughts are with
the families at this time," the spokeswoman said.
Salmonella is a bacterium that causes food poisoning. It can often
occur in under-cooked food.
The source of the outbreak was first suspected on January 2 and
confirmed six days later.
