prevent another fuel crisis. There was no intention of changing
employment law affecting tanker drivers, he said at the meeting, and

The National Health Service was taken off its red alert emergency

Straw said earlier that there must be no repeat of last week's
crippling shortages.
"One of the key things that emerged... at the beginning of last week
was the oil companies' lack of preparedness for a blockage of this
kind," he noted.
Water, gas and electricity firms already have a legal duty to ensure
supplies, and Straw said similar measures could be applied to the oil
industry.
He also said the task force would also look at supply arrangements. The
practice of supplying "just in time" had made supplies particularly
vulnerable, he added.
Fuel protesters have promised to resume the blockades unless the
government backs down on fuel tax -- though Downing Street says
legislation will not be introduced until after the Queen's speech,
which is expected in November.
