World Cup notebook 
Monday's World Cup diary
Beyond words
Sweden's Kennet Andersson was overcome by his side's advance to the
World Cup semi-finals, where they will meet Brazil.
"It's kind of a dream," Andersson said. "I can't explain it in English.
I don't think I can explain it in Swedish, either." 
Bulgarians living high
Bulgaria's joy at reaching the World Cup semi-finals is given an extra
dimension by memories of the financial hurdles they have overcome.
Last year Bulgarian football officials could not even send coach
Dimitar Penev to take a look at his foreign-based players.
"This is a beautiful stadium," Penev said when he first saw Giants
Stadium, which is shared by the New York Giants and New York Jets
American football teams. "I wish we could take it home with us." 
Seats available
Bulgaria's quarter-final victory over three-times champions Germany
caught a lot of people by surprise.
World Cup organisers had made up a press-box seating chart for
Wednesday's semi-final at Giants Stadium that allotted a big block of
seats to German reporters.
Now the seats are going begging, with the Bulgarian press contingent
consisting of just 36 reporters.
