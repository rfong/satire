Greece Holds Love Telethon for Street Kids
The love telethon, which is being held jointly by Greece's public
television channel NET and the United Nations International Children's
Fund (UNICEF), started at 6:30 P.M. (local time) and will continue
until the early hours of Tuesday morning, with a number of guests stars
and celebrities appearing.
In Greece, the number of street kids totals some 5,800, and the vast
majority of them are forced to beg by their parents or so- called
guardians.
Lambros Kanellopoulos, president of UNICEF branch in Greece, has said
that the problem of street kids has taken on dangerous dimensions not
only in Greece but around the world.
He urged people to pay more attention to the issue of street kids.
Currently, there are 100 million street kids around the world who are
forced to beg or work to survive.
