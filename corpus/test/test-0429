Shanghai Issues Phone Card for Basketball Team 
Shanghai's post and telecommunication authority issued a phone card on
Tuesday to mark the promotion of the city's basketball team to the
Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) first division league this season.
About 8,000 phone cards, each with the face value to 25 yuan (3 U.S.
dollars), will be sold at the eastern coastal city.
Shanghai Oriental Sharks were promoted to the top-flight league last
year and now placed fourth on the standings in the 1996-97 season.
