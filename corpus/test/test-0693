World Highest Plateau: A Prime Target for Hail 
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the highest plateau in the world, suffers
more from hail than anywhere else in China, according to statistics of
the Meteorological Department of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
Nagqu Prefecture, in northeast of Tibet, is pounded by hail an average
of 36 days a year. The prefecture's record for days of hail per year is
53; the minimum is 23.
The plateau embraces the whole of Tibet and Qinghai, western Sichuan
and southwestern Gansu -- an area of 2.3 million square kilometers,
4,000-5,000 meters above sea level.
The hailstorms have caused serious losses to the agricultural
production on the plateau, said weather experts.
Tibet plans to set up a man-induced weather modification system on the
plateau within 15 years in order to minimize the economic loss from
hail damage by as much as 300 to 500 million yuan (36 to 60 million US
dollars), experts said.
