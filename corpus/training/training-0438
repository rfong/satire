Pakistani police detain 80 protestors 
Pakistani police have detained some 80 people after a protest by
thousands of government employees demanding higher salaries, a senior
police officer said Tuesday.
"We have taken into custody around 80 people. They were in violation of
the law," the officer said, preferring not to be named.
He said government employees from Quetta, capital of southwestern
Baluchistan province, went on strike and staged a protest sit-in on
main roads Monday.
"They incited the people to stage the demonstration despite an official
ban on taking out processions," he said, adding that those detained
included some of their leaders who were trying to disrupt law and
order.
Officials said the provincial government earlier this month agreed to
allow a 20 percent increase but some employees refused the raise and
went on strike.
The strike was partial and most offices are working normally, they
said.
