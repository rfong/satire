Italy/NNP and/CC Greece/NNP ,/, which/WDT are/VBP already/RB members/NNS but/CC have/VBP yet/RB to/TO abolish/VB controls/NNS ,/, cited/VBD legal/JJ objections/NNS which/WDT could/MD also/RB take/VB months/NNS to/TO solve/VB before/IN they/PRP can/MD scrap/VB controls/NNS ./.

The/DT Netherlands/NNPS will/MD even/RB reintroduce/VB full/JJ passport/NN controls/NNS at/IN the/DT international/JJ airport/NN of/IN Schiphol/NNP on/IN Monday/NNP ,/, because/IN current/JJ infrastructure/NN can/MD not/RB sufficiently/RB separate/VB so-called/JJ Schengen/NNP from/IN non-Schengen/JJ passengers/NNS ./.
