Manufacturing, Services Major Contributors to Malaysian Economy
The manufacturing and services sectors were the prime contributors to
Malaysia's growth in productivity, with contributions exceeding 80
percent each year over the 1993-96 period, according to a government
report released today.
In 1996, these two sectors accounted for about 89 percent of the
productivity growth of the economy, said the 1996 Productivity Report
issued by the government National Productivity Center.
It said Malaysia's productivity growth for the 1990-94 period moved
faster than that of the seven major countries of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development -- the United States, Japan,
Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada.
Last year, Malaysia's productivity growth stood at 6.6 percent against
the average 5.5 percent during the period of 1993-95, it said.
To improve future productivity growth, the report suggested four
actions -- stimulating demand, developing human resources, allocating
scarce resources efficiently across sectors and encouraging technical
change.
