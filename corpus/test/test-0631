Hingis Takes on Seles in WTA Final 
World number one Martina Hingis and former number one Monica Seles will
have their third final-meeting at the 450,000 U.S. dollar WTA Toshiba
Classic after both scored straight-set triumphs in semifinals Saturday
at San Diego, California.
Hingis breezed Mary Pierce 6-0, 6-2 in just under 50 minutes while the
second seeded American Seles beat third seed Amanda Coetzer of South
Africa 6-3, 6-4, in the other semi-final.
Hingis will seek her ninth WTA Tour title of the season. As the
youngest Wimbledon winner this century, she also has won the Australian
Open, the Sydney International, Pan Pacific Open, Open Gaz de France,
the Lipton and Family Circle Cup.
Hingis has bettered her match record to 53-1 this year after this
semifinal. Seles has a 26-8 record but has lost her four finals this
year, two of them to Hingis.
The top prize will be 79,000 U.S. dollars.
