The streak, which started, on May 30, 1992, is not Ripken's only
accomplishment
He has earned American League rookie of the year honors, and twice the
AL most valuable player award. He has started in 12 straight All-Star
games, hit more home runs than any shortstop in history and set or
shared almost a dozen fielding records.
When he clocks up game number 2,131, he'll be playing half an hour from
his childhood home, in front of Orioles fans who have backed him his
entire career.
As the day draws nearer, fans are preparing to celebrate. Tickets for
Wednesday's game are selling for up to 1,000 dollars.
President Bill Clinton has indicted he would like to attend.
"From what we understand, there's a good chance he'll be here," Orioles
spokesman John Maroon said.
Orioles event coordinator Spiro Alafassos said the team planned some
ceremonies for Tuesday, when Ripken should tie the record.
The fireworks will come on Wednesday.
"That's the day we really whoop it up," he said. Some of the special
touches are being kept secret, as a surprise for Ripken.
But his children, 5-year-old Rachel and 2-year-old Ryan, will throw out
the ceremonial first pitch. Jazz musicians Branford Marsalis and Bruce
Hornsby will play the national anthem.
Opposing pitchers are feeling the strain. No one wants to go down in
history as the man who beaned Ripken and stopped the streak.
"I'd pitch him inside," said Dennis Eckersley. "But you don't want to
drill him."
Ripken says he hopes the streak is not affecting his opponents.
"I've noticed that everyone else is starting to think about this injury
thing," he said. "I'm the last person to think about that, and I would
hope that the pitchers on the mound and the people playing the game are
the last people thinking about it."
