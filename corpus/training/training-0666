Train evacuation test needed before Eurostar gets licence back 
Eurostar, the passenger train service that operates through the tunnel
linking Britain and France, must conduct an emergency evacuation
exercise before it can get its operating licence back, officials said
here Friday.
Anglo-French authorities have told Eurostar that, following a
devastating fire on November 18, Eurostar must pass a test evacuation
as "one of the conditions" for the resumption of its operating licence,
officials at the tunnel operators, Eurotunnel, said.
Operators of the tunnel are eager to resume the running of services
through the tunnel but have as yet been given no firm date for the
resumption.
Repair work is continuing in the tunnel which was badly damaged when a
freight train caught fire.
Eurotunnel said Wednesday it hoped some passenger services would resume
next week, and insisted that the route was safe.
