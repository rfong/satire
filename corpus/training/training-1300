Clinton Says to Do Whatever to Revive Mideast 
President Bill Clinton said on Tuesday that he would do anything that
could promote peace process in the Middle East, but again he
deliberately avoided to make a direct criticism of Israel for its
political assassination of a Hamas leader.
"I would go anywhere or do anything that I thought would be most
effective in promoting the peace process," Clinton said at a photo
session in the Oval Office with visiting Israeli President Ezer Waizman
before their talks.
The president again was very careful not to scold Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when reporters asked his comment on a
failed assassination on Sept. 25 when two agents of the Israeli
intelligence service Mossad tried to kill Hamas political leader Khaled
Meshal by poisoning.
"I think that Israel's struggle against terrorism is important. But
it's also important to consider the consequences on people who are your
allies, whatever actions are taken," he said.
He repeated his call for reviving the peace process in the region,
saying: "That's really the only way to ultimately get rid of the
terrorist problems in the Middle East."
