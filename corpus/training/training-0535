Suspect in Clinic Shootings Handed Out Fetus Pictures 
A man accused in three American abortion clinic shootings handed out
pictures of aborted fetuses outside a church recently and told the
pastor that the Catholic Church wasn't doing enough to fight abortion,
a newspaper has reported.
John Salvi III is accused of killing two clinic workers and wounding
five others Friday in two clinics in the Boston suburb of Brookline,
then spraying more than 20 shots into a Norfolk, Virginia, clinic the
next day.
The 22-year-old student hairdresser from Hampton, N.H., was to be
arraigned Tuesday in Norfolk on a charge of firing into an occupied
building. At a brief conference before his arraignment, Judge Reid M.
Spencer granted Salvi's request for a court-appointed attorney. When
Spencer asked him if he objected to having cameras in the courtroom
during his arraignment, Salvi shook his head no.
Salvi was expected to be taken to Massachusetts later this week to face
murder charges.
For years, 4th graf.
