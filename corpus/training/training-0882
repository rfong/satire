Indian PM Wants Meeting With Pak PM in Colombo 
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has written a letter to
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif desiring a meeting with him next
month in Sri Lanka, a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan said
Monday.
Both Indian and Pakistani prime ministers plan to attend a summit of
the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation scheduled to be
held next month in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
A Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman announced on June 20 that the two
prime ministers would hold a meeting during the summit.
It will be the first meeting between the two leaders after India and
Pakistan conducted their nuclear tests in May.
They are expected to discuss bilateral issues and regional situation
besides the core issue of Kashmir, according to the report.
It said the Pakistani prime minister has always availed himself of such
opportunities to hold negotiations with his Indian counterpart.
He held four meetings with former Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral in the Maldives, the United States, Britain and Bangladesh.
No official response has so far been made by the Pakistani government
to Vajpayee's letter.
