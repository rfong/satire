World AIDS Campaign Launched in India 
Asia's first World AIDS campaign, which highlights the need to change
social attitudes toward the fatal disease and make men more responsible
in their sexual behavior, was launched in India on Monday.
The campaign, with a theme of "Men Make A Difference," aims to raise
awareness on the relationship between men's sexual behavior and the
spread of AIDS, and to encourage people to talk about sex and gender
issues to remove prejudice and ignorance, said Peter Piot, executive
director of UNAIDS, who is here to promote the campaign.
Piot said that more than two decades after the Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) surfaced, focus has for the first time shifted to men's
role in the spread of the disease.
Irresponsible sexual behavior of men put both men and women at risk, he
stressed, adding that men should be made aware of their role as fathers
and the potential impact of their behavior on both their spouses and
children.
Indian Health Minister N T Shanmugam pointed to the fact that the AIDS
epidemic is continuing to evolve in an atmosphere of fear, stigma and
discrimination. In 1999 alone, he said, nearly 5.6 million people, or
over 15,000 a day, became infected with HIV worldwide.
He agreed that the spread of AIDS has highlighted the need for behavior
change in both individuals and societies, particularly among men.
