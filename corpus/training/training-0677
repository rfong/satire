U.S. Policy Advisers Meeting on Iraq 
Key foreign policy advisers of U.S. President Bill Clinton met on
Monday to review the developments in the Middle East with Iraq's
withdrawal from Irbil which Iraq announced was under way, a White House
spokesman said.
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry and other diplomatic and
intelligence advisers have been meeting daily since Iraqi troops
crossed the 36th parallel, designated by U.S.-led allies as a "no fly"
after the Gulf War in 1991, and captured the Kurdish city of Irbil over
weekend.
The Clinton administration has made it clear it was ready to retaliate
even as Saddam Hussein began withdrawing his troops from the city to
avoid a showdown with American forces.
White House deputy spokesman Jim Fetiz said there is evidence the Iraqi
army is ready to conduct more attacks in the eastern part of northern
Iraq.
U.S. troops in the Middle East remain on high alert but U.S. officials
would not disclose what action, diplomatic or military or both, is
being considered to take.
Two senior U.S. envoys is now in the Middle East to consult with Iraq's
neighbors for a United action against Iraq.
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman John Shalikashvili and Assistant
Secretary of State for Near Easter Affairs Robert Pelletreau first
talked with officials in Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and is now in Egypt.
