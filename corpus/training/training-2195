Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said here today that Russia
hoped for a stable situation in the Balkan region and the removal of
all sanctions against Yugoslavia.
In a brief statement to the press upon his arrival here, Primakov said
he was visiting Yugoslavia for the first time in his capacity as
foreign minister and he was looking forward to have dialogue with
Yugoslav officials to discuss bilateral and regional issues of mutual
