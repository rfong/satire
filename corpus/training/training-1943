Joint Russian-U.S. Space Mission Over 
Another stage of the Russian-U.S. program of manned space missions has
been completed, as the U.S. Atlantis shuttle completed undocking from
the Russian Mir station this morning, sources at the Mission Control
Center said.
The undocking was completed at 11:16 Moscow time (08:16 GMT). The
Atlantis was docked with the Mir on Wednesday.
The sources said that the U.S. space shuttle is to turn around the Mir
two times at a distance of 150 meters before departing for the earth.
The Atlantis crew will inspect the Russian space station and make
snapshots and video-filming.
The shuttle, with U.S. astronauts Kenneth Cameron, James Halsell, Jerry
Ross and William McArthur and Canadian Chris Hadfield on board, will
land on November 20, said the sources at the center located in Moscow.
Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Avdeyev and astronaut of the
European Space Agency Thomas Reiter will continue work aboard the Mir
till February 1996. Their expedition, initially planned for 135 days,
was extended to 179 due to unpreparedness of a rocket which was to
bring the next crew, the sources said.
The three-day joint space mission of the two 100-ton (each) spacecrafts
resulted in the delivery to the Mir of a new Russian-made docking
tunnel. It was used for the present docking and it is expected to be
employed in the next five joint flights of Russian and U.S. spaceships.
The sources said that the crews carried out medical, technological and
ecological experiments as part of the Russian-U.S. program for space
investigations for peaceful purposes.
Accumulated experience will be used for construction of an planned
international orbital station, Alfa, the sources added.
