City Abolishes Old Policies to Pave Way for Wider Opening 
The city government of Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi
Province, has abolished over 2,000 outdated documents and policy papers
to further develop the local economy through a wider opening-up to the
outside world.
Meanwhile, local government departments concerned have adopted a
so-called "one-door" system to simplify the official procedures of
handling investment issues in the city. Many of the relevant government
bodies have been canceled or merged.
The documents abolished were mostly features of the old planned economy
or local protectionism, which were severely hampering the current
market-oriented reforms, according to local officials.
Furthermore, local disciplinary and supervision departments have sent
officials to look over the work of these departments to prevent any
possible malpractice.
