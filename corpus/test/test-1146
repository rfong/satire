Sword Adds Clues to Western Han Culture 
A bronze sword dating to the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.--24 A.D.)
has been found in Puding County in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
This is the maiden finding of such a relic in the southwestern part,
making people know more about the country's culture over the period.
The sword is queerly shaped, with a gourd-like hilt and a long sunken
part, with a length of 29.6 centimeters.
A farmer at Huachu Village found the sword when digging a well in front
of his house.
The sword-lying part was a mountain valley, and then became arable land
after many years of alluviation, archeologists say, ruling out the
possibility for the sword to come from a tomb or an ancient relic site.
