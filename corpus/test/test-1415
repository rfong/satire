As a public service to those thoroughly confused NFL fans who are
trying to decipher the playoff picture, please find enclosed the
official league tiebreakers. As always, any rebroadcast or
retransmission of this ``Weekend Picks'' exclusive is against all sorts
of rules and stuff, unless you have written permission from Buddy Ryan
or Newt Gingrich, who I believe are the same person.
1. If two or more teams are tied, the team that actually won a game
this season without the help of Three Blind Refs is disqualified.
2. If teams still tied (hereafter, I.T.S.T.), team considering giving
Marion Campbell, Jerry Glanville or Les Steckel another chance is out.
3. I.T.S.T., team that moved from Baltimore is out.
4. I.T.S.T., team that plays indoors is out.
5. I.T.S.T., coaches who agreed with Gene Stallings' and Bobby Bowden's
decisions after touchdowns are out.
6. I.T.S.T., team that lost to Bengals, Oilers, Redskins or Bucs is
out.
7. I.T.S.T., call me. I'll think of something.
Whether the Falcons ever make it to a tiebreaker situation remains to
be seen. But what are the odds of losing to New Orleans twice? (Don't
answer that.) Assuming Atlanta defense doesn't make Mario Bates look
like Gale Sayers again, Falcons win Sunday.
OTHER MEDIOCRE GAMES
Brownies at Cowboys: Let's see. Dallas wins one game with Jason Garrett
and another with Rodney Peete. Now they get Troy Aikman back. Wait,
don't rush me. This could take some time. OK, Cowboys win. But let's be
daring. Take Cleveland and the 10-point spread.
Vikings at UnpredictaBills: Oh no. They won again, didn't they? They're
going to make the playoffs again. They're going back to the Super Bowl
again. CAN'T THEY JUST LEAVE US ALONE! I feel better now. I have my
doubts about this pick, but I can't bring myself to side with Buffalo.
So Minnesota wins. Please.
Pigeons at Steelers: So Rich Kotite threatens to start Bubby Brister,
then changes his mind and says, well, OK, Randall can come out and
play. Bright move for a coach who's about to be out of a job. When
Philly was 7-2, this looked like a great game. Now it's the Carquest
Bowl. Steelers win.
Broncos at Raiders: So who collapses first -- John Elway or Jeff
Hostetler? No matter, Vince Evans and Raiders' supporting cast can whip
Hugh Millen and anybody. Raiders win.
Niners at Lightning Bolts: It's probably too late for the Raiders to
catch the Chargers in the AFC West. But it's not too late for San Diego
to slip to a record more conducive to its talent level. S.D. can't slow
down S.F.
EVEN MORE STUFF!
Lafayette at Georgia Tech: The Tech basketball team already has
exceeded the campus footballers' win total for 1994. I know, hard to
believe. Then again, the Jackets have played Coastal Carolina, Western
Carolina and East Carolina -- all the Carolinas that don't matter. Who
next -- Nagshead State? Might as well be. Saturday, Tech wallops
Lafayette (a Pennsylvania team that doesn't matter).
Georgia at Jacksonville: As Ray Goff can tell you, Bulldogs and
Jacksonville just don't mix. But the Florida team has to be a little
tired after that Alabama game. Go with Georgia Saturday.
