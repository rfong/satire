Sharapova rival Ana Ivanovic: Federer hates Russian slags
Women's world number two seed Serbian Ana Ivanovic has hit back at press
stories linking Russia's Maria Sharapova and Roger Federer romantically as
"lurid crap" and denied the Swiss twelve times grand slam champ seduced her
in a steamy Flushing Meadows sauna.
"It was at the Stade Roland Garros physio clinic," Ivanovic said today,
"and its wasn't just some tawdry, tacky grand-slam-thankyou-mam,"
Ivanovic scoffed, "it was the spiritual meeting of twin souls,
consummating the beginnings of a lifetime's amour."
Doha Women's Open Organisers have billetted Ivanovic safely away from
feisty blonde Russian Champion Maria Sharapova after fears of a
pre-title catfight breaking out in public.
Ivanovic, 20, has reluctantly refrained from issuing her own YouBoob!
video about the Federer tryst after receiving some written advice from
Roger Federer's long-time girlfriend Slovakian-born Mirka Vavrinec's
lawyers.
"Bah, they don't scare me!" Ivanovic said dissmissively today.
Meanwhile the tennis world's top male celeb newspaper Men With Balls
has promised half a million dollars to anybody proving Federer is
anything but firmly shackled to his long-suffering fiancee Mirka.
Venus Williams is cock-a-hoop.
