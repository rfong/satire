Swiss Healthcare Group Plans to Launch Aids-fighting Drug 
The Swiss healthcare group Roche plans to launch a new Aids treatment
drug for patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy, the
company's chairman said on Wednesday.
The drug, named T-20, is being developed with the United States biotech
firm Trimeris Inc., and is expected to be available in 2003.
Roche chairman Franz Humer said he anticipates that it will gain
approval in the United States and Europe, and would later be more
widely used.
"If the data is good, I would expect a rather rapid approval for such a
drug," Humer said.
T-20 is the first of a new class of anti-HIV drugs called fusion
inhibitors, which are designed to prevent the Aids-causing virus from
penetrating the body's cells. Unlike many HIV medicines, T-20 must be
injected, rather than taken as a pill.
The new drug represents a new approach in that it is designed to
prevent HIV from fusing with human cells. It represents a significant
stride in fighting the constantly mutating virus.
