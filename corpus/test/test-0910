Senate Overwhelmingly Votes Down Anti-Press Law 
The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted down a controversial law
that would have sharply curtailed media coverage of corruption scandals
ensnaring politicians.
The conservative Senate voted against the so-called so-called Marsaud
amendment to anti-corruption legislation by 300 to 5 after two hours of
debate. Both left- and right-wing parties opposed it.
Justice Minister Pierre Mehaignerie nonetheless said that two
fundamental rights -- the presumption of innocence and the freedom of
the press -- remain in conflict and urged six months of reflection on
reconciling them by judges and journalists.
Denounced by journalists as self-serving, the amendment was adopted by
the National Assembly during a sparsely attended night session Nov. 21.
Subsequent media outrage, joined by politicians who deemed the bill
poorly thought through, led to the Senate laws committee to reject it
last week, virtually assuring its demise in a full vote.
Introduced by conservative lawmaker Alain Marsaud, the amendment would
have forbidden the press from reporting early details of investigations
without the subject's consent.
It was drafted in response to complaints that details of investigations
often are leaked to the press in preliminary stages when suspects are
theoretically protected by privacy laws.
Premier Edouard Balladur, front-runner to succeed President Francois
Mitterrand in elections next year, has seen his popularity eroded by
corruption scandals that forced three of his ministers to resign. All
said leaks to the press hurt their reputations.
