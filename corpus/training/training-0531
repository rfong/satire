Government Calls for Vote of Confidence on Budget Measure
Premier Lamberto Dini on Wednesday called a vote of confidence in his
government over a deficit-cutting package, bringing Italy's political chaos
to a moment of truth.
Discouraged by a series of amendments in the Chamber of Deputies that
watered down the package, he said the confidence vote was necessary
''for the Italian economy and thus the future of the entire national
collectivity.''
If Dini's government wins the confidence measure, the entire
deficit-reduction package would pass as he wants it. The package,
mainly new taxes, is designed to cut a dlrs 100 billion deficit.
The document passed last week in the Senate. But Dini doesn't have
clear support in the lower Chamber. He received a potential boost
Wednesday when an official of the ex-Christian Democrats said the
party's deputies would support him.
The confidence vote was scheduled for noon Thursday.
Dini's predecessor, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, has been fighting
for new elections since being forced to resign in December when a
coalition ally turned on him.
Berlusconi's conservative bloc has threatened to vote down the deficit
package unless it gets a promise of spring elections.
A left-leaning coalition dominated by the former Communists -- losers
in the election that made Berlusconi premier -- are backing Dini.
Dini, a former central bank executive, was named as a politically
neutral premier to form Italy's 54th postwar government.
He has promised to step down once his fiscal initiatives are under way,
but refused to Berlusconi's demands for a spring election deadline.
