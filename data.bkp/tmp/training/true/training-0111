The/DT great/JJ English/JJ actress/NN Ellen/NNP Terry/NNP defined/VBD star/NN quality/NN as/IN ``/`` that/DT little/JJ something/NN extra/JJ ,/, ''/'' though/IN she/PRP could/MD n't/RB explain/VB what/WP that/DT little/JJ something/NN extra/JJ was/VBD ./.

``/`` A/DT star/NN is/VBZ someone/NN who/WP attracts/VBZ your/PRP$ attention/NN even/RB when/WRB he/PRP or/CC she/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB doing/VBG anything/NN ,/, ''/'' suggests/VBZ George/NNP Sidney/NNP ,/, who/WP directed/VBD dozens/NNS of/IN stars/NNS during/IN MGM/NNP 's/POS golden/JJ years/NNS ./.

``/`` Spencer/NNP Tracy/NNP could/MD be/VB standing/VBG behind/IN Clark/NNP Gable/NNP and/CC just/RB nodding/VBG ,/, but/CC you/PRP could/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC notice/VB him/PRP ./.

``/`` Stars/NNP have/VBP a/DT kind/NN of/IN inner/JJ magic/NN that/WDT makes/VBZ you/PRP want/VBP to/TO look/VB at/IN them/PRP ./.
