Cambodian PM Hun Sen arrives home from Singapore 
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen arrived back here Thursday after a
five-day private trip to Singapore where he gave a series of lectures
on his government's policies.
In a lecture forum, Hun Sen said the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations' (ASEAN) plan to integrate the economies of the 10 members was
a boost for ry's relative inexperience in external trade.
Cambodia's ties with Singapore were strengthened last year when the
city-state's Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong, visited here in early May.
The 10 ASEAN members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.
