Sweden Takes Advantage into Playoff Round 
Sweden moved into the playoff round of the World Ice Hockey
Championships with a perfect unbeaten record and a big advantage after
posting a 3-1 victory over the United States in their final round-robin
match in Group A on Saturday in Turku, Finland.
Russia, the United States, Canada, Finland and the defending champions
Czech Republic also qualified but because of a format that allows teams
to carry points over, Sweden will already be at least one win up on the
others when the playoff round begins in Helsinki on Monday. Olympic
Champion Sweden go through with a record of four wins and one tie.
The United States won three games in Group B but will arrive in
Helsinki with no points, as none of victories came against teams that
advanced to the playoff round. Though easily advanced, the U.S. chances
of claiming the title was slim after their loss to Sweden.
Top three teams of the group qualified for the next round.
Hosts Finland were faced with the same fate until they struck five
unanswered goals to steal a 7-4 win against previously unbeaten Russia,
sending both teams into the next round with two points.
Canada secured their place in the next round with a 6-0 win over Italy.
