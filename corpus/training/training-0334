Colombia's FARC Chief Says IRA Members Came to Exchange Opinions 
The chief of Colombia's largest rebel group said Wednesday that three
arrested Irish Republican Army members came to the guerrilla heartland
only to "exchange opinions," denying they were offering explosives
training to the guerrillas as military authorities speculated.
In an interview with the weekly journal Voz, leader of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) Manuel Marulanda denied
Martin McCauley, James Monaghan and Niall Connolly provided training on
explosives and arms to his organization. He admitted that they are
"representatives of Sinn Fein," the political arm of the independent
IRA Army.
The visits by international delegates in the neutral area are frequent,
Marulanda said. The three Irishmen came "to exchange opinions. They
told us about their fight and their peace process."
Marulanda said other visitors in the region include political parties
and movements from Europe and Latin America, as well as personalities
like the president of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Grasso, and
Queen Noor of Jordan.
McCauley, Monaghan and Connolly were arrested on August 11 at Bogota's
international airport when the three Irishmen were trying to fly with
false passports to Paris after a five-week stay in the neutral area in
central-southern Colombia.
The leader of Colombia's largest rebel army said the arrest of the
three men from Sinn Fein hurts the peace process between the government
and FARC, and the peace process for Northern Ireland, where the parties
in conflict have kept a two-year truce.
The Colombian Attorney General's office accused the IRA members of
assisting illegal activities and using false documents.
Colombian authorities have up to eight months to initiate court
proceedings and present evidence against the three men.
