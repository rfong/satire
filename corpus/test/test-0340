Injured Guscott in England World Cup squad 
England's rugby selectors have included star centre Jeremy Guscott in
their provisional World Cup squad even though they have no idea when
he'll be fit again.
Guscott hasn't played since early last season and had to pull out of
the summer tour to South Africa because of a pelvic problem.
But such is the selectors' regard for his match-winning potential that
they have included him in the 34-man squad that will have its first get
together in early September.
"There are a lot of rumours flying round about when Jeremy will start
playing again," England's technical director Don Rutherford admitted on
Thursday.
"One rumour is it will be at the beginning of the season, another that
it won't be until November or December.
"The truth is we do not know for certain, and we won't know how fit he
is until he plays. But he is still in the squad.
"We hope he will be available for the Five Nations Championship. But
such is Jeremy's ability, if he is fit, fresh and ready he will be in
the squad."
The provisional squad will be updated throughout the season, based on
fitness and form, beforeit is pruned to a likely 26-man squad for the
World Cup next summer.
Apart from Guscott, the squad bears a strong resemblance to the party
that went to South Africa, sharing the Test series one-all, though
outside-half Stuart Barnes has since announced his retirement.
