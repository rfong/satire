Spanish President to Visit Morocco Next Week 
Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez will meet his Moroccan counterpart
Abdelatif Filali and King Hassan II next week to promote bilateral
relations, Spanish Foreign Ministry announced today.
Gonzalez's visit is aimed at mending bilateral economic and cultural
ties, which began deteriorating last year due to the controversial
renewing of the fishing agreement between the European Union and the
north African Arab country.
Several agreements will be signed during the visit, covering foreign
affairs, justice, finance, transport, education, energy and tourism.
Spain will provide Morocco with credits worth 150 billion pesetas (1.2
billion U.S. dollars) till the year 2000 to promote the latter's
economic development, the Foreign Ministry said.
Spain is Morocco's third largest customer and supplier, with a trade
balance in Morocco's favor.
