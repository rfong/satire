Manhunt for mystery lioness 
Some 75 policemen and forest rangers backed up by a helicopter launched
a manhunt Tuesday for a lioness spotted roaming the countryside near
the French Channel port of Dieppe.
A police crisis unit was set up after the animal, which has not been
reported missing from any zoos or circuses in the area, was spotted by
a woman near her house Monday.
"This is a wild animal which could be very dangerous if threatened. It
should under no circumstances be approached," said a statement issued
by Dieppe police.
The young animal was first spotted Monday morning by a resident of
Auquemesnil, 15 kilometers (10 miles) northeast of Dieppe, near her
car. An hour later it was seen five kilometers away.
Alerted, police launched a hunt in nearby woods. They found tufts of
lion fur but no sign of the animal itself. It remains a mystery where
the beast comes from.
On Tuesday anyone spotting her was warned to inform the police
immediately.
