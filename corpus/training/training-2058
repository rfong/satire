Bank of France holds key rate unchanged 
The Bank of France held its key tender rate unchanged at 3.60 percent
on Thursday.
Most analysts had predicted that the bank would probably hold the rate,
particularly in view of German M3 money supply figures on Thursday
which showed growth of 10.5 percent in M3 in May.
