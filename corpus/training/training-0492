Nine houses blown up in former Moslem Bosnian village 
Nine unoccupied houses in a former Moslem village in Serb-held Bosnia
were blown up early Sunday, the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR)
said.
Russian and US troops were despatched to the village of Mumici,
northeastern Bosnia, after the explosions at 1.00am (midnight GMT), an
SFOR spokesman said.
The village, one of many from which the Moslem occupants fled during
the 43-month Bosnian war, is situated three kilometers (two miles)
south of Dugi Dio, a village close to the former Serb-Moslem front line
where the UN says Moslem refugees plan to return soon.
As part of the Dayton Peace accords, which ended the war in 1995,
Moslem and Croat refugees are granted the right to return to their
homes in Serb territory, but UN officials say few have done so.
In the past few months, the UN said several hundred unoccupied houses
have been blown up on both sides of the former front line, apparently
in an attempt to deter the former occupants from returning.
