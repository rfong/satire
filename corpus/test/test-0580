Czech koruna hits record high 32.68 to the euro 
The Czech currency, the koruna, rose Wednesday to a record high of
32.68 to the euro, up from 32.78 Tuesday, dealers said.
In the face of a strengthening koruna, Prime Minister Milos Zeman urged
the Czech National Bank to lower its interest rates.
The CNB cut key rates by a half point on November 29, bringing its
refinancing rate to 4.75 percent, its savings rate to 3.75 percent and
its Lombard rate to 5.75 percent.
Analysts said the currency's strengthening, mainly linked to an influx
of foreign investments in the Czech Republic, could be better managed
by a more restrictive government policy, including a sharp reduction in
spending of privatization revenues.
