Nepal to Build Airports for International Flights 
Nepal has started preliminary work for developing two airports into
international flight destinations in an effort to promote the ongoing
Visit Nepal Year '98, the official RSS news agency reported Thursday.
Work on additional technical and passenger facilities at the Biratnagar
and Bhairahawa airports has begun, and arrangements are also being made
for immigration, customs, security and money exchange facilities, the
RSS said.
At the preliminary stage, the objective is to operate flights from the
two airports to nearby cities in India, Bangladesh and Bhutan.
Biratnagar is a city in Moran district of eastern Nepal, while
Bhairahawa is situated in Rupandehi district of western Nepal.
Currently, the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in the capital
city Kathmandu is the sole airport operating international flights.
