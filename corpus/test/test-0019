Perry: NATO Ready To Help After Serb Takeover Of U.N. Enclave
NATO ``stands ready to help'' in the aftermath of a Bosnia Serb
takeover of the U.N.-protected enclave of Srebenica, Defense Secretary
William Perry said today.
Perry said NATO warplanes successfully carried out strikes today
against Serb tanks that were threatening Dutch peacekeeping forces in
Srebenica area.
In brief remarks to reporters in a Pentagon hallway, Perry said it was
too early to determine the extent of damage inflicted on the Serb
armored forces.
``So far it has gone according to plan,'' Perry said. ``We were called
upon to provide support'' for the Dutch ground troops, ``and to attack
tanks which were threatening the Dutch troops. That mission was
satisfactorily carried out.''
When asked how the fall of Srebenica might affect U.S. involvement in
Bosnia, Perry replied, ``NATO stands ready to help. We've got planes in
the air ready to help as requested. I can't comment much beyond that
because it is an ongoing operation.'
On Capitol Hill today, Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said the warplanes that led the strike against the
Serb tanks returned safely. Shalikashvili did not disclose the
nationality of the planes.
But U.S. defense officials said the strike was carried out by American
and Dutch warplanes flying out of Aviano Air Base, Italy, and off the
U.S. carrier Theodore Roosevelt off the coast of Bosnia.
The officials, speaking on condition they not be identified, said U.S.
Air Force F-16 fighters and Air Force A-10 tank-killers were joined by
Dutch planes in the air assault. Also, U.S. radar-jamming aircraft
accompanied the attack jets, the officials said.
Shalikashvili told lawmakers that the planes had the authority from
both the U.N. and NATO to attack Bosnian Serb air defense sites such as
SAM missile launchers or aircraft-detecting radar stations.
``For that close air support mission, NATO airplanes were allowed to
suppress air defense sites,'' Shalikashvili said. ``In addition to that
they had all the (defensive) aircraft with them.''
UNPROFOR is the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia.
Use of the term ``close air support,'' a term that refers to air
attacks in support of ground troops, suggests that today's assault may
not have been simply a retaliation for previous Bosnian Serb
provocations. It appears the strike was also an active effort by NATO
to prevent the fall of Srebrenica, one of the so-called eastern
enclaves in Bosnia and a U.N. ``safe area.'' The enclaves are Bosnian
government territory surrounded by hostile Bosnian Serb forces and have
been a flashpoint throughout the Balkan war.
