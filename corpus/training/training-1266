Inflation Pressure Reduces in Kenya 
Inflation pressure was improved last December in Kenya with the
month-to-month inflation indicator falling for the first time in four
months, according to a weekly statistical bulletin issued by the
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
The month-to-month inflation indicators which had been rising gradually
since last September declined in December to 10.84 percent from 11.38
percent in November which reached the peak since September.
Inflation was felt hard in July 1996 when the three-month annualized
rates were highest in the year, standing at 20.11 percent, much higher
than the 10 percent inflation target set by the Kenyan government.
A similarly heavy inflationary impact was also felt in March and August
last year.
Inflation pressure is expected to ease towards the first quarter this
year on account of an expected slow-down in monetary expansion,
according to an earlier statement by the CBK.
the growth in money supply is projected to slow down considerably to
the targeted 13.1 percent in the early part of 1997, the statement
pointed out.
Meanwhile, the Kenyan government is expected to exercise further fiscal
discipline in order to increase revenues and reduce expenditures by the
government departments to ease the inflation pressure.
