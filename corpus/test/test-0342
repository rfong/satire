Nine billion yen to be spent on end-of-war events in Japan: report 
Japan's 33 prefectures and nine major cities plan to spend some nine
billion yen (100 million dollars) on a series of events this year to
mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, the Japan Times
reported Wednesday.
In the atomic-bombed city of Hiroshima, in western Japan, a total of
about 5.3 billion yen has been earmarked for a series of anniversary
events.
The Hiroshima municipal office plans a postcard campaign designed to
deliver messages from citizens to people around the world.
A Hiroshima International Cooperation Fund will also be established to
promote inter-city cooperation for world peace. International art and
video festivals are also being planned by the city.
Meanwhile, the nation's southernmost prefecture, Okinawa, where
Japanese and US forces fought a fierce battle in the closing days of
the war, will organize a nationwide tour of the Okinawa War Exhibition.
Elsewhere, memorial services for the war dead are scheduled in
Ishikawa, Kagawa and Miyazaki prefectures, while Nara and Kagoshima
prefectures will organise a tour of overseas battle sites overseas.
Various other events and projects to oppose war and promote peace are
being planned in other prefectures and cities, the daily said.
