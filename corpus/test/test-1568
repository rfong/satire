Croatia Indicts Suspected Prison Camp Commander
A Serb accused of being a commander of a brutal prison camp has been
arrested and indicted on charges of murder, torture and crimes against
humanity.
Mirko Grahorac was arrested in Croatia's Adriatic port of Split in in
early March after he was recognized on the street by at least three
former inmates of the Manjaca prison camp in northern Bosnia, the
Zagreb daily Vecernji List reported Wednesday. The arrest had not been
previously announced.
The public prosecutor's office in Split told The Associated Press that
Grahorac, 53, was indicted Tuesday. He is awaiting trial at Split
criminal court, said Slavko Mrsic, a deputy public prosecutor.
If convicted, Grahorac faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Grahorac is accused of beating, torturing and killing Muslim and Croat
prisoners in the Manjaca prison camp, one of three camps in northern
Bosnia where Serbs allegedly carried out atrocities against non-Serbs
in the summer of 1992.
Grahorac has denied the charges, Mrsic said.
The newspaper paper said Grahorac had returned to Split, where he had
worked as a police officer before war broke out, after the Bosnian
Serbs closed the Manjaca camp in late 1992 following an international
outcry.
It was unclear why Grahorac, a Serb born near Manjaca, would return to
Split, where ex-Croat or Muslim prisoners from Manjaca were likely to
recognize him.
The newspaper, quoting prosecutors, said Grahorac had been in charge of
security in Manjaca.
The three witnesses who claimed they recognized Grahorac said the
suspect would beat them with rifle butts and electric cables. One of
the witnesses claimed he was tortured by Grahorac, the prosecutor Mrsic
said.
Another witness said two of his fellow inmates, both Muslims, had died
as a result of Grahorac's repeated and violent beatings.
The indictment said Grahorac and Serb guards used knives to kill seven
prisoners who had just been transferred to Majaca in September 1992,
Mrsic said.
Although Bosnians, Croatians and Serbs are all said to have committed
atrocities in Bosnia, international organizations and monitoring groups
hold the Bosnian Serbs responsible for the bulk of them.
The Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague has already named the
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and other senior Bosnian Serbs as
possible war crimes suspects.
So far the tribunal has indicted 22 Serbs on charges including
genocide, murder, torture and rape. It has not indicted Grahorac.
The only war crimes suspect in custody of the tribunal, Dusan Tadic,
was arrested in Germany also after being spotted by Bosnian refugees,
former camp detainees.
It is yet unclear if Croatian authorities will hand over Grahorac's
case to the tribunal. The tribunal would be unable to prosecute
Grahorac if Croatia tries him, because suspects cannot be tried twice
for the same offenses.
Croatia's criminal code entitles it to try anyone who has committed
offenses against Croatian citizens abroad. Croats in Bosnia
automatically have Croatian citizenship.
So far, Croatia has charged more than 250 Serbs with crimes against
humanity and genocide allegedly committed during a six-month war in
Croatia in 1991 after the republic proclaimed independence from
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
Fewer than 10 of the Serbs are in custody. The exact number is unknown.
