Kwasniewski Left Warsaw to Start China Visit 
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski left here today to begin a
state visit to China, which he hopes will help strengthen economic
relations between the two countries.
During the five-day visit, the first by a Polish head of state since
1959, Kwasniewski is scheduled to meet Chinese leaders to discuss
bilateral relations and international issues of common concern.
In an interview with Chinese reporters on the eve of his visit,
Kwasniewski said his visit would be a new beginning in the history of
Sino-Polish relations and would give a great hope for the development
of bilateral relations.
He said he would "take full advantage of the visit" and "enhance
dialogue and cooperation with China."
The potential of the Sino-Polish relationship, especially that of
economic cooperation has not been fully tapped, he said, adding that
time is ripe now to fully tap such potential.
Noting that Poland and China used to share a good tradition of economic
cooperation, the president said that in recent years, such cooperation
was weakened for various reasons. Now, he said, the two countries
should explore new ways of cooperation by strengthening exchanges and
mutual understanding.
He also said the two countries should strengthen dialogue, not only at
the central government level, but also at the level of local
governments.
Kwasniewski said Poland highly valued the role China plays on the
international stage. As Poland also plays its appropriate role in world
affairs, it will benefit both Poland and China to have good cooperation
in international politics, he said.
He said that he visited China in 1988 as the minister of youths and
sports of the former government. He made a private visit to China in
1989.
