Sri Lanka Offers Reward for Information on Assassin 
Sri Lanka's police on Monday issued a public notice offering a cash
reward of 2 million rupees (28,000 U.S. dollars) for any information
relating to the attempted assassin of President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
The notice carrying two photographs of the female suicide bomber seeks
information on details such as her antecedents, associates and
accomplices, police said.
President Kumaratunga was blinded in her right eye when a suicide
bomber exploded herself in an assassination attempt on the president at
an election rally on December 18, 1999 in central Colombo. 24 persons
including several security personnel died in the incident.
The police want to know whether the bomber was in Colombo or in the
suburbs, what her haunts were, whom she associated with, who harbored
her and who brought her and the suicide kit to Colombo.
Although over a month has elapsed since the incident and American
experts were brought in to help with the investigations, no major
breakthrough has been made despite several hundred persons being
interrogated.
The government has blamed the suicide bombing on the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam rebels who are fighting for independence for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
