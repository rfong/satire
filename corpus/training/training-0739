NKorea's Kim may be jointly leading with military
North Korea's de-facto leader Kim Jong-Il may be moving towards joint
leadership with the country's top military men, according to a report by a
Southern defence journal published here Sunday.
The Defence Daily cited "several unusual events," including the
delivery of an important speech by armed forces minister Choe Kwang
rather than a top party official, as indications that Kim may have
chosen to rule with the military.
Most North Korea analysts here have in the past dismissed the
possibility of collective leadership in fanatically-isolated North
Korea since the death of Kim's father, Kim Il-Sung, 16 months ago.
But the analysts, who have cited the rigid pyramid-type structure of
the power elite in Pyongyang, have not ruled out a strengthening of the
military's position amid the uncertainty following the elder Kim's
death.
"Several unusual phenomena seen in the events commemorating the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the North's ruling Workers' Party on
October 10 indicate an increasing possibility that Pyongyang may adopt
a collective leadership of Kim jong-Il and the military," Yonhap news
agency quoted the journal as saying.
Past October 10 celebrations, it said, had not included military
rallies, nor had the main address been delivered by a military man but
by a leading party official. It also said the proportion of military
men involved in routine events had swelled from 10 to 30 percent.
"Out of 23 functions undertaken by Kim Jong-Il since the death in July
of last year of Kim Il-Sung, 17 involved the military," it added.
