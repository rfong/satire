Israeli/NNP Government/NNP Boasts/NNPS Victory/NNP on/IN Statehood/NNP Israeli/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Benjamin/NNP Netanyahu/NNP Tuesday/NNP credited/VBD his/PRP$ government/NN for/IN compelling/JJ Palestinians/JJ delay/NN statehood/NN declaration/NN ./.

He/PRP added/VBD that/IN Israel/NNP will/MD continue/VB to/TO oppose/VB any/DT unilateral/JJ declaration/NN of/IN a/DT Palestinian/JJ state/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

At/IN a/DT crowded/JJ news/NN conference/NN in/IN his/PRP$ office/NN ,/, Netanyahu/NNP said/VBD Palestinian/JJ National/NNP Authority/NNP Chairman/NNP Yasser/NNP Arafat/NNP backed/VBD down/RP from/IN a/DT plan/NN to/TO declare/VB statehood/NN on/IN Tuesday/NNP because/IN ``/`` he/PRP understands/VBZ that/IN we/PRP will/MD respond/VB very/RB firmly/RB ./. ''/''

Flanked/VBN by/IN Foreign/NNP Minister/NNP Ariel/NNP Sharon/NNP and/CC Defense/NNP Minister/NNP Moshe/NNP Arens/NNP ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, for/IN the/DT last/JJ four/CD years/NNS ,/, Israel/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN telling/VBG Arafat/NNP not/RB to/TO declare/VB a/DT Palestinian/JJ state/NN unilaterally/RB ./.

``/`` Now/RB he/PRP wisely/RB backed/VBD off/RP ,/, ''/'' Netanyahu/NNP said/VBD ./.

Arafat/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN that/IN the/DT Palestinians/NNPS have/VBP the/DT right/NN to/TO declare/VB an/DT independent/JJ state/NN on/IN May/NNP 4/CD ,/, the/DT date/NN by/IN which/WDT Israel/NNP and/CC the/DT Palestinians/NNPS are/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO have/VB reached/VBN a/DT permanent/JJ agreement/NN according/VBG to/TO the/DT Oslo/NNP accords/NNS ./.

But/CC the/DT international/JJ community/NN has/VBZ urged/VBN him/PRP to/TO hold/VB off/RP such/PDT a/DT move/NN since/IN it/PRP might/MD destroy/VB the/DT already/RB troubled/JJ peace/NN process/NN and/CC drive/VB Israeli/JJ voters/NNS to/TO elect/VB a/DT hard-line/JJ government/NN to/TO power/NN in/IN the/DT May/NNP 17/CD elections/NNS ./.

The/DT Palestinian/JJ Central/NNP Council/NNP ,/, a/DT 124-member/JJ Palestine/NNP Liberation/NNP Organization/NNP leadership/NN body/NN ,/, decided/VBD last/JJ week/NN to/TO postpone/VB a/DT decision/NN over/IN statehood/NN proclamation/NN until/IN after/IN the/DT Israeli/JJ elections/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, Netanyahu/NNP pointed/VBD out/RP the/DT postponement/NN was/VBD only/RB temporary/JJ and/CC Arafat/NNP has/VBZ left/VBN the/DT door/NN open/JJ for/IN a/DT new/JJ declaration/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP want/VBP to/TO make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ that/IN we/PRP 'll/MD continue/VB to/TO oppose/VB any/DT actions/NNS in/IN defiance/NN of/IN the/DT treaties/NNS we/PRP have/VBP signed/VBN ,/, ''/'' Netanyahu/NNP said/VBD ./.

These/DT unilateral/JJ actions/NNS are/VBP ``/`` unacceptable/JJ and/CC illegal/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP added/VBD ./.

``/`` For/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN the/DT Palestinians/NNPS ,/, for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN peace/NN and/CC for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN our/PRP$ common/JJ future/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT Palestinians/NNPS not/RB to/TO declare/VB a/DT state/NN unilaterally/RB on/IN May/NNP 4/CD or/CC any/DT day/NN at/IN all/DT ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

The/DT Israeli/JJ government/NN has/VBZ threatened/VBN to/TO annex/NN parts/NNS of/IN the/DT West/NNP Bank/NNP still/RB under/IN its/PRP$ control/NN if/IN the/DT Palestinians/NNPS declare/VBP a/DT state/NN unilaterally/RB ./.

Sharon/NNP ,/, the/DT leading/VBG hawkish/JJ minister/NN ,/, reiterated/VBD this/DT position/NN at/IN the/DT news/NN conference/NN ./.

Netanyahu/NNP added/VBD that/IN if/IN such/PDT a/DT declaration/NN is/VBZ made/VBN ,/, Israel/NNP would/MD also/RB bar/VB Israeli/JJ individuals/NNS or/CC corporates/NNS from/IN investing/VBG in/IN the/DT Palestinian/JJ areas/NNS or/CC demand/VB Palestinian/JJ compensation/NN for/IN financial/JJ benefit/NN it/PRP has/VBZ enjoyed/VBN from/IN Israeli/JJ investment/NN ./.

The/DT prime/JJ minister/NN denied/VBD that/IN the/DT tightening/VBG Israeli/JJ control/NN over/IN Jerusalem/NNP ,/, including/VBG demolition/NN of/IN Arab/JJ houses/NNS ,/, confiscation/NN of/IN Palestinian/JJ residencies/NNS and/CC closure/NN of/IN Palestinian/JJ institutes/NNS ,/, is/VBZ also/RB a/DT unilateral/JJ action/NN banned/VBN by/IN the/DT Oslo/NNP agreements/NNS ./.

``/`` The/DT status/NN of/IN Jerusalem/NNP ,/, as/IN it/PRP stands/VBZ now/RB --/: under/IN fully/RB Israeli/JJ sovereignty/NN --/: ,/, will/MD be/VB maintained/VBN until/IN it/PRP is/VBZ decided/VBN otherwise/RB -LRB-/-LRB- in/IN future/JJ agreements/NNS with/IN the/DT Palestinians/NNPS -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, Israel/NNP is/VBZ not/RB violating/VBG the/DT status/FW quo/FW of/IN Jerusalem/NNP and/CC will/MD ``/`` act/VB to/TO ensure/VB the/DT continuance/NN of/IN Israel/NNP 's/POS sovereignty/NN over/IN the/DT city/NN ./. ''/''

The/DT fate/NN of/IN Jerusalem/NNP ,/, over/IN which/WDT the/DT Palestinians/NNPS also/RB claim/VBP sovereignty/NN ,/, is/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB negotiated/VBN in/IN the/DT final-status/JJ talks/NNS ,/, which/WDT should/MD have/VB begun/VBN by/IN May/NNP 1996/CD according/VBG to/TO Oslo/NNP accords/NNS ,/, but/CC has/VBZ never/RB happened/VBN ./.

Netanyahu/NNP is/VBZ running/VBG a/DT neck-and-neck/JJ campaign/NN with/IN One/NNP Israel/NNP leader/NN Ehud/NNP Barak/NNP in/IN the/DT runup/NN to/TO the/DT May/NNP 17/CD elections/NNS ./.

He/PRP has/VBZ charged/VBN that/IN Barak/NNP will/MD not/RB stand/VB as/IN firmly/RB as/IN he/PRP does/VBZ against/IN a/DT Palestinian/JJ state/NN ./.

The/DT opposition/NN lashed/VBD out/RP at/IN Netanyahu/NNP over/IN what/WP they/PRP called/VBD his/PRP$ attempt/NN to/TO turn/VB a/DT diplomatic/JJ failure/NN into/IN a/DT victory/NN ,/, describing/VBG the/DT convening/NN of/IN the/DT news/NN conference/NN is/VBZ ``/`` nothing/NN but/CC election/NN propaganda/NN ./. ''/''

One/NNP Israel/NNP legislator/NN Shlomo/NNP Ben-Ami/NNP said/VBD as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN fact/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ Arafat/NNP who/WP has/VBZ gained/VBN international/JJ support/NN for/IN his/PRP$ postponement/NN of/IN a/DT declaration/NN of/IN statehood/NN ./.

Center/NNP Party/NNP leader/NN Yitzhak/NNP Mordechai/NNP said/VBD the/DT Palestinians/NNPS had/VBD agreed/VBN to/TO put/VB off/RP a/DT unilateral/JJ declaration/NN when/WRB they/PRP signed/VBD the/DT Wye/NNP agreement/NN in/IN Washington/NNP last/JJ October/NNP ./.
