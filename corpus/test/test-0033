Device Flips Pachyderms So They Can Get Pedicures
Flip an elephant on its side so you can trim its toenails? Impossible,
you say.
Not to Tod A. Ricketts of Springfield, Mo., who has invented a device
that does just that. And he has sold five of them to the nation's zoos
for as much as $100,000, with options.
The contraption promises to transform the care of elephants. Foot
infections, for example, are a major killer of elephants in captivity,
and the device makes it easier to clean their feet.
It also will make elephant keeping, one of the most dangerous jobs
anywhere, much safer.
``It works even better than I hoped,'' Ricketts said.
When Mike Blakely, the zoological curator at the Kansas City Zoo, heard
about the device, he was doubtful that elephants, renowned for their
strength and intelligence, would submit to such treatment.
``We thought he was crazy,'' Blakely said.
But the instant zookeepers saw a demonstration, they were sold. The
Kansas City Zoo became one of the first buyers of the device.
Standing more than 12 feet high and weighing more than 15 tons,
Ricketts' elephant restraint has the zoo world abuzz. The St. Louis Zoo
has bought one, and inquiries are coming in from zoos in Singapore,
Australia and Saudi Arabia.
The National Zoo in Washington viewed a videotaped demonstration and
hopes to buy one this year.
Why all the fuss? For one thing, the occupation of elephant handler is
perhaps the riskiest in North America. A handler's safety depends on
the ability to dominate an animal that can weigh 6 tons and more.
Tasks such as trimming toenails, drawing blood samples and performing
various medical treatments are done with little protection. Sedatives
are used only as a last resort, because of injuries elephants suffer
when they fall.
At first glance, Ricketts, 30, would seem an improbable person to
improve the life expectancy of elephant handlers. He grew up on a farm
outside of Springfield and received a degree in industrial management
from Southwest Missouri State University.
But as the son of a veterinarian, he was familiar with the restraints
his father used on horses and cows. And his college degree included
computer-aided design.
While in college he began to work as an elephant keeper at
Springfield's Dickerson Zoo. There he became familiar with the risks of
the job.
``If you do it long enough, you're going to be attacked,'' he said.
With the zoo's encouragement, he began to work on an elephant restraint
in 1989. A few zoos had already experimented with them. Basically, they
consisted of a movable wall on one side and a stationary barrier on the
other.
But with that design, it was still difficult to perform foot care.
What if, Ricketts thought, you could flip an elephant on its side?
``It had never been done before, and more than anything there was a
resistance to change,'' he said.
By 1992, a prototype was installed at the Dickerson Zoo. The only
reaction from the first elephant was a quick bellow. The contraption
worked.
Here's how: The elephant enters a chute. On one side is a metal wall.
On the other are three movable metal panels that operate independently
to adapt to the elephant's girth.
Metal flaps, which operate hydraulically, jut out from the sides to
keep the elephant's head up and away from whoever is working on it.
Two-inch-wide nylon belts can be tied around the elephant's feet and
girth. The belts around the girth hold the elephant so that if it has
to be sedated it won't fall.
To rotate the elephant, the chute pivots. Once the elephant is flipped,
the metal floor opens for access to the feet.
On the other side, a 10-foot-high platform gives access to the top and
head of the elephant for surgery and taking of blood samples.
If Ricketts' design was a success, his timing was even better.
Dwindling numbers of wild elephants were causing zoos to increase
efforts at artificial insemination for elephants in captivity -- a task
that requires a good restraint.
Zoos also have been under more pressure to make elephant handling
safer. In 1982, Casey, an elephant bull at the Kansas City Zoo,
seriously wounded two keepers.
After that, new quarters and procedures separated Casey from his
keepers, but some medical care had to be deferred. A stone, for
example, is suspected of being in his foot, but the foot has had to go
untreated.
The traditional way of caring for elephants was by dominating them --
hitting them with a hook and yelling at them. But that appalled many
zoo visitors.
For those reasons and others the Kansas City Zoo decided to use a
``hands off'' approach as soon as it could purchase a restraint, which
was installed late last year.
``I now sleep better at night,'' curator Blakely said.
As for Ricketts, Research Equipment Co. in Bryan, Texas, recently made
an offer to build the restraints. Ricketts had already formed his own
company to make them.
Ricketts accepted the offer and is now a designer at the company. A
design for a giraffe restraint is completed and work has started on one
for a rhinoceros. In fact, Ricketts said, his work has just begun.
``There's a lot of species out there,'' he said.
