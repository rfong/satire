Musharraf "reasonably sure" Pearl alive 
Visiting Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said Wednesday he was
"reasonably sure" that Daniel Pearl is alive and that he was "as close
as possible" to getting the abducted US reporter released.
"I am reasonably sure he's alive," Musharraf said of The Wall Street
Journal correspondent during a joint White House appearance with US
President George W. Bush. "We are as close as possible to getting him
released."
"I very much hope that, with all our efforts, and the combined efforts
from all the intelligence agencies in Pakistan, we will be able to get
Mr Pearl released," said Musharraf.
