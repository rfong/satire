Pope Honors Martyr in Outdoor Mass 
Pope John Paul II blessed the bones of a Catholic martyr at an outdoor
Mass on Tuesday, unaffected by a reported assassination plot in the
Philippines and the arrest of a gunman here.
The pope rode between engagements in Port Moresby on Monday in a chair
in the back of a pickup truck. A yellow awning provided his only
protection -- from the elements.
Authorities downgraded earlier reports of potential threats to John
Paul's security during his stay in this South Pacific island nation.
Two Iranians sought by police were reported to have left the country a
week before the pope arrived.
Police said a Filipino was detained after trying to enter Sir John
Guise Stadium for the Mass with a fully loaded, German-made pistol.
But Assistant Police Commissioner Philip Taku said Perfecto Santos,
described as a businessman and long-time resident, had a permit to
carry the gun and was released after questioning.
Taku contradicted an earlier written statement that Santos had been
charged, saying charges were being considered.
During the Mass, the highlight of his two-day visit here, John Paul
beatified Peter ToRot, a lay teacher ordered to halt his missionary
work by Japanese occupation forces in World War II. In 1945, a Japanese
military doctor killed him with a lethal injection.
``The wars, concentration camps and intolerance of our own time have
yielded a rich harvest of martyrs in many parts of the world,'' John
Paul said. ``Tuesday your fellow countryman ... has been listed among
them.''
Beatification, the last step before possible sainthood, is part of John
Paul's program to give local models to Catholic communities, especially
where they are minorities. Nearly a third of the 3.9 million people in
Papua New Guinea are Catholics.
ToRot's exhumed bones were carried in a tiny casket by a procession of
bare-chested men and women wearing feathered headdresses and necklaces
of shark and dog teeth. The casket was placed in a small thatched hut
beside the altar.
ToRot's 49-year-old daughter, Ruffina, called the ceremony ``an
indescribable joy. I'm so happy.''
An estimated 8,000 people attended the Mass in a downpour, Port
Moresby's first rain in seven months.
Many in the crowd reached out to touch the pontiff as he was driven
around the stadium, but security men surrounding the truck held them
off.
In addition to Santos' gun, three dozen knives also were confiscated,
chief police superintendent Dennis Samin reported. He said that wasn't
unusual because many residents carry knives to peel betel nut, a mildly
narcotic nut.
Security for the pontiff, who survived a 1981 assassination attempt,
had already been tightened because of threats that Muslim extremists
would try to bomb an American plane to protest John Paul's tour.
In the Philippines, authorities announced Monday they had uncovered a
plot against the pope during his visit there and had changed the route
of his motorcade as a result.
A Philippine National Police spokesman said Tuesday that a Jan. 7
search of an apartment near the Vatican's official residence found a
large quantity of chemicals that could be made into explosives, along
with priming devices, computers, bibles, crucifixes, buttons with papal
insignia, pictures of the pope and maps of the papal entourage's route.
Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the Vatican was not informed of
the threats and that the only deviation on the motorcade route in
Manila was near the airport.
John Paul arrived in Papua New Guinea from the Philippines on Monday.
Police said that night they were looking for two Iranians who had
dropped from sight after checking out of their hotel three hours before
the pope arrived.
Commissioner Taku said the Philippine Embassy had reported their
presence here but that checks showed they left for Manila on Jan. 9.
John Paul leaves Wednesday for Australia and Sri Lanka, the last stops
on his 11-day Asian pilgrimage.
