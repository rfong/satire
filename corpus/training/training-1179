Olympic diary 
Olympic diary for Wednesday:
Rebel flag attacked
Daily demonstrations have been launched in Atlanta by opponents of the
rebel Confederate flag, the official flag of the state of Georgia. The
flag which they denounce as racist flew at the head of Confederate
forces fighting for the slave-owning South against the North in the
American Civil War. Opponents will gather daily at the state capital
building in downtown Atlanta and other public and private buildings in
the city where the flag flies. The International Olympic Committee have
ruled the flag out of bounds at Olympic venues. 
Sex -- the more the better
Israeli researchers are encouraging women to have sex in the Athletes
Village. "The more orgasms the better," Alexander Olshanietzky, head of
a Tel Aviv cardio-vascular clinic, told AFP. "Women compete better
after an orgasm, especially high jumpers and runners." Men, however,
should abstrain according to findings from research conducted on
hundreds of athletes since the Barcelona Games.

In the United States they call her the Michael Jordan of women's
soccer. Mia Hamm is the key to US ambitions to win the first women's
gold medal in the sport at the Olympic Games. The 24-year-old North
Carolina star, US women's soccer player of the year for the past two
years, has being playing international soccer since her teen years. US
coach Tony DiCicco said: "She is brilliant in attack and will be the
star of the final -- which we hope to win."
