I am the Congressional crooner
Now you can hear it all! That's right America. Not only will your
future president be the funkiest liberal in town, I also am a mega
recording star. I'm huge in Iceland! Buy my new audio masterpiece
"Politics in the Key of Love." Here is just a sample of some of the
rockin' tunes you'll get on this triple CD:
* "Sixteen Tons" (It's the opener!)
* "Born to Run" (I'm the working man's candidate, so a song from the
working man's musician)
* "Brother Can You Spare a Dime?" (You didn't think this wouldn't
make it on did you? I mean, this tune -- just the refrain actually
-- is my entire platform)
* "Who Let the Dogs Out?" (Dedicated to the Republicans)
* "Working for the Weekend" (Of course)
* "Convoy"
And
* "The Macarena"
