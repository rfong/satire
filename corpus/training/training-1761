Fiji treason trial faces plea bargain with lesser charges likely 
Fiji coup plotter George Speight and 12 others are set to strike a plea
bargain which will see the capital charge of treason dropped against
them in return for guilty pleas on lesser charges, legal sources told
AFP.
"There will be a deal to reduce all charges so they all plead guilty
and the evidence is stifled," a source said.
Speight and 12 others were charged with treason following a May 2000
armed insurrection in which then prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry and
his government were held hostage for 56 days.
The military negotiated a deal signed on July 9, 2000 which saw the
hostages freed and military arms returned while the plotters were given
immunity.
The hostages were freed four days later and on July 26, 2000, Speight
and others were arrested on a variety of charges eventually
consolidated into a single charge of treason containing 13 overt acts.
The High Court trial was due to begin on February 19 before English
Justice Peter Surnam but it will now be before Chief Justice Sir Timoci
Tuivaqa who has attracted fierce criticism for his role in helping
draft decrees used in declaring martial law.
Legal sources said Speight, who is representing himself in court, wants
to make a statement in court on who was behind the coup.
Said one source: "He is going to blow the whistle on those behind the
coup".
Fiji judicial authorities could not be contacted for confirmation of
the pending plea bargain.
