Shanghai Customs Confiscates Smuggled Relics 
Shanghai Customs officers announced Wednesday that they confiscated 798
cultural relics which were intended to be smuggled out of the country.
Among the items being smuggled, 733 articles are regarded as being the
third-level most precious relics in accordance with the list of the
State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH), the officers said.
The case is the most serious one in recent years, said an officer who
found the smuggled relics in 45 bags belonging to a foreign passenger.
The relics include shell coins, knife-shaped ancient coins and metal
coins, some of which have never been preserved by the Shanghai Museum.
Customs and police authorities are investigating the case.
