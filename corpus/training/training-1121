Macao Civil Servants to Have Higher Salary 
Macao Government has decided to increase the salary of its civil
servants by 6.82 percent this year.
The proposal of pay increase has been submitted for discussion at the
Macao Legislative Assembly (LA), and is expected to become effective
from July 1.
After the increase, the starting point of salary of 4,400 Patacas
(about 556.9 U.S. dollars) will be raised to 4,700 Patacas (about 595
U.S. dollars).
The government says that the salary rise is a result of high inflation
rate, which hits 7.7 percent in April. Previously, organizations of
civil servants have complained that the increase is too low.
According to current laws, the salary of Macao governor,
undersecretaries of the government, chairman (chairwoman) and members
of the LA, and other high officials will also be raised along with the
salary rise of civil servants.
Macao Civil Servants perhaps enjoy one of the world's highest salary.
The average salary of civil servants reached 11,188 Patacas (about
1,416.2 US dollars) in 1994 and the salary still rise each year.
