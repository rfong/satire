Carter Monitors Renewed Fighting in Bosnia, Stands Ready to Return 
Former President Jimmy Carter partially blames spring weather for the
breakdown of the cease-fire in Bosnia and stands ready to return there
to renegotiate peace.
Carter told reporters Friday he is talking daily with the Clinton
administration over the renewed fighting in Bosnia, but he won't return
until he's asked to by President Clinton or by Bosnian leaders.
``I think everyone realizes that when and if both sides feel that we
should come back, then we would be available. And I would put this at a
very high priority,'' Carter said during a briefing on this week's
meeting of the Carter Center's International Negotiation Network.
Bosnia was not on the agenda for the meeting, but it's been the top
subject recently at the Carter Center, he said. ``Within the last two
weeks, we've probably spent more time on Bosnia than we have anything
else.''
Carter also said that: --No agreement for dismantling North Korea's
suspect nuclear program will succeed unless leaders of North and South
Korea hold talks. --Warring factions in Sudan have honored for more
than a week a cease-fire brokered by Carter. No previous cease-fires
have lasted more than 24 hours, he said. --The Carter Center will play
no role in trying to win the release of two Americans serving
eight-year prison sentences in Iraq for illegally entering the country.
Carter said that is because ``this is such a highly sensitive area and
the U.S. policy is so clearly known.''
In Bosnia, Carter negotiated a cease-fire in December that was
scheduled to last four months, but it broke down after three months
when the government launched a surprise attack.
``The response of the Bosnian Serbs has been moderate, but there's a
danger, a prediction, that all-out war is going to break out again,''
Carter said.
Carter said he agreed with the theory that the beginning of spring
contributed to the breakdown in Bosnia because warmer weather
traditionally prompts an escalation in fighting.
He also attributed the breakdown to disagreements within the United
Nations group that is in Bosnia to monitor the conflict.
``The contact group is divided among themselves,'' Carter said.
``There's a total difference in perspective among the Americans
compared to the French and Germans compared to the Russians.''
On Korea, Carter said he stands ready to return there to try to start
talks between North and South Korea on defusing nuclear tensions.
South Korea said Thursday it will pull out of a deal reached last
October to dismantle North Korea's suspect nuclear program by April 21
unless South Korean reactors are used as replacements. North Korea is
balking for reasons of pride, Carter said.
Carter helped broker an agreement last June for the first-ever
inter-Korea summit, but plans for the summit were put on hold after
North Korean President Kim Il Sung died July 8.
``The direct talks between North and South Korea are the biggest unmet
need'' in solving the nuclear conflict, Carter said.
Carter said he is pleased that the cease-fire he negotiated last week
in Sudan is holding up.
He said he talks daily with his son, Chip, who arrived in Sudan this
week to monitor the two-month cease-fire and to help international
health workers launch an attack on Guinea worm disease.
