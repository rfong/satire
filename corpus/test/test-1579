In July, the French and U.S. governments reached a truce in a
decade-long tussle over dividing royalties on patents for the blood
test for infection with the AIDS virus. The test is crucial for
screening the blood supply as well as identifying those infected with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Until very recently, scientists thought that tests based on those
pioneering patents, which cover the two strains of the virus known as
HIV-1 and HIV-2, could reliably identify the presence of the virus in
all cases. Evidence is mounting, however, that a new type of the virus
is so different from the first two strains that it can elude current
modes of detection.
While officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
have said that the blood supply in the United States remains safe --
variants of the new strain have been discovered mainly in people from
Cameroon -- they have acknowledged that blood tests should be modified
to detect variations of the new strain, which is currently referred to
as subtype O.
Now Innogenetics, a privately held biotechnology and medical
diagnostics company in Ghent, Belgium, says it has received the first
patents anywhere in the world for a test for subtype O. It recently
received a patent from the United States and one from Australia and
said that it had been notified that the European Patent Office would
issue a patent soon.
The U.S. patent covers the use of antigens, or pieces of proteins that
make up the subtype O virus, in detecting antibodies. These are basic
components of the immune system that become activated in response to
the virus.
Dr. Hugo Van Heuverswyn, a molecular biologist who founded Innogenetics
and is its chief executive, said that scientists from several countries
were evaluating a subtype-O test developed by his company.
``What you want to do is change the existing test as little as possible
in order to test for all strains at the same time,'' he said.
Dr. Van Heuverswyn said that his company had not yet struck deals with
other makers of tests for AIDS virus infection but that many companies
had expressed interest in licensing the technology.
``The patent covers the use of type-O virus material in order to detect
type-O infected people,'' he said. ``Anyone developing such a test
without receiving a license from us would be infringing on our
patent.''
Innogenetics, which said it had more subtype-O patent applications in
the pipeline, was assigned U.S. patent 5,304,466.
Fiber optic cables offer many advantages over slower copper wires in
transmitting electrical signals, but they have an Achilles' heel: dirt.
``If there's even a micron of dirt, the light can't get through, so it
won't work,'' said David J. Stein, who has a received a patent for a
``device for cleaning and polishing an optical fiber.''
Optic fibers, made of glass or acrylic, generally are encased in and
protected by several layers of materials, but frequently a cable must
be spliced to another cable. That exposes the raw end of the optic
fiber, and it is in these connections that dirt can do its mischief.
Technicians who maintain fiber optics equipment, which is used mainly
in the telecommunications and medical industries, normally clean these
connections with an ordinary swab dipped in a solution. This is a not
an ideal method, according to Stein.
``If you're just wiping back and forth, all you're doing is
redistributing the dirt,'' he said.
Stein's invention, intended primarily to be used with a connector's
so-called female receptacle, is shaped somewhat like a bolt. Protruding
from a cylindrical disk at the top is a hollow rod made of a porous
material that attracts dirt. A technician would insert the rod into a
connector receptacle and, holding the disk between his fingers, twirl
it around, Stein said. Because the rod attaches midway between the
center and the periphery of the disk -- rather than at the center --
the bottom of the rod twirls in a sweeping, elliptical fashion.
``This way, you're getting cleaning action from mechanical friction and
you're also getting cleaning from a vacuum, suction-type action through
the center of the rod,'' he said.
Stein said his company, Prime Products Inc. of Springfield, Mass., had
developed several prototypes of the invention and lined up a
subcontractor that could manufacture the device, which would be
disposable. His company is also seeking to license the patent, he said.
Patent 5,325,452 was granted to Stein and his father, Harold M. Stein.
Wild animals, and in particular deer, are extremely sensitive to the
smell of humans. Thus, hunters who are stuck in blinds for hours face
the problem of how to answer nature's call without leaving behind a
scent that will frighten off their prey.
``Sitting in a tree for eight or nine hours, the urges get to you,''
said Richard A. Temple Sr., a fire captain and hunter in Minden, La.
``Most people I know use milk jugs -- but they're noisy.''
Temple recently received a patent for a ``deer stand urinal device.''
About the size of a lunch box, the device has a strap at the top to
allow the hunter to hang it from a tree when not in use.
Protruding from the top side of one end of the device is a sort of
spout that channels urine through two baffles that slow the flow and
muffle noise.
Ultimately, the urine is deposited in a small chamber attached to the
outside of the box. The chamber, holding chlorine tablets, can be
easily removed and emptied, according to Temple, who said the device
had an adapter so women could use it.
Temple, who has built a prototype of his invention and hopes to license
the idea, received patent 5,309,578.
Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark
Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.
