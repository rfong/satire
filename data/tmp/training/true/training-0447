He/PRP releases/VBZ a/DT letter/NN to/TO Democratic/NNP Chairman/NNP Robert/NNP E./NNP Hannegan/NNP in/IN which/WDT he/PRP says/VBZ ,/, ``/`` You/PRP have/VB written/VBN me/PRP that/IN .../: a/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT delegates/NNS have/VBP been/VBN directed/VBN to/TO vote/VB for/IN my/PRP$ renomination/NN for/IN the/DT office/NN of/IN president/NN .../: If/IN the/DT convention/NN s/VBZ hould/VBN carry/VB this/DT out/RP ,/, and/CC nominate/VB me/PRP for/IN the/DT presidency/NN ,/, I/PRP shall/MD accept/VB ./.
