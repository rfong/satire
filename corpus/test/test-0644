ICC Officials Meet With ACB On Bribery Allegations 
Pakistan has not been given any deadline to conclude an investigation
into allegations that Australian players were last year offered bribes
to lose matches, International Cricket Council chief executive David
Richards said Tuesday.
Richards and ICC chairman Sir Clyde Walcott spent two hours meeting
with Australian Cricket Board officials in Sydney -- a meeting at which
the bribery allegations were discussed.
Sir Clyde said the ACB had been briefed on the action the ICC has so
far taken.
The cricket world was thrown into turmoil in early February when it was
alleged Australian spinners Shane Warne and Tim May had been offered --
and rejected -- bribes to bowl badly in the first Test against Pakistan
in Karachi last October. Pakistan won the match by one wicket.
The ICC said last Friday that the Board of Control for Cricket in
Pakistan (BCCP) now is responsible for investigating the affair.
``I didn't ask for a particular time line,'' Richards said. ``We have
got confidence in their (BCCP's) ability to go and deal with it.''
News of the alleged bribe offered to Warne and May sparked a spate of
similar allegations.
Former Australian captain Allan Border claimed he was offered a bribe
to let England win the fifth Test at Edgbaston in 1993.
Retired Pakistan paceman Sarfraz Nawaz also alleged his country's
players were bribed prior to a limited-overs loss against England in
1992.
ACB officials declined to comment or issue any statement at the
conclusion of Tuesday's meeting.
