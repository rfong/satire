Israeli chief-of-staff asks for better neo-Nazi control 
The Israeli army chief-of-staff on Wednesday asked the German
government to strengthen controls over neo-Nazi groups.
General Ehud Barak, the highest ranking Israeli soldier to pay an
official visit to Germany, was visiting the former concentration camp
at Sachsenhausen when he said that all forms of anti-Semitism,
neo-Nazism and nationalism "have to be put down with an iron fist."
Barak laid a wreath at the memorial to victims of Nazism in the camp,
which is in the suburbs of Berlin, accompanied by General Klaus
Naumann.
Barak, who will leave Germany on Thursday, has held talks with Naumann
on bilateral relations between the German and Israeli armies.
His agenda also includes a meeting with the minister to the
chancellery, Friedrich Bohl and a visit to the 51st reconnaissance
squadron to look at the European-manufactured Tornado fighter and the
Russian MiG-29.
The latter used to belong to the East German army before being
recuperated by the German army when Germany unified in 1990.
The Sachsenhausen concentration camp sufferd an arson attack in 1992
just after a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
