South Africa orders probe into arms sales to Burundi, Rwanda 
The South African government has ordered police, army and intelligence
services to probe reports that former apartheid agents are illegally
selling arms to troubled Burundi and Rwanda, arms committee chairman
Kader Asmal said Friday.
Asmal, who heads the cabinet's National Conventional Arms Control
Committee (NCACC), vowed the government would punish South Africans
involved in deals in contravention of a government ban.
He said the NCACC hoped to make a report to the full cabinet by the end
of August.
Johannesburg's Sunday Independent newspaper, quoting a member of a
South African arms commission, reported Sunday that small arms,
explosives and equipment are flowing out of South Africa to Hutu
extremist rebels in Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire.
In the past few weeks, the newspaper said, weapons on Tadjiki and
Uzbeki cargo planes, piloted by Russians, have come into Zaire from
South Africa and Angola.
Officials who once sold weapons on the black market for the former
white minority government during the arms embargo against apartheid
South Africa, are controlling the trade, it said.
Asmal told state radio Friday that the trade was not officially
sanctioned but said the government could not rule out the possibility
that officials employed by state arms companies were involved.
"We just don't know the extent of the problem or the degree of
complicity of South Africans," Asmal said. "We are responding in good
faith because it is a very serious matter."
Asmal vowed the government would prosecute those involved "with the
full blast of the law" and urged members of the public with information
on arms control violations to contact the police.
Last Thursday, Burundi's government was taken over by Major Pierre
Buyoya in a bloodless coup which has prompted fears of further
bloodshed in the troubled central African country, where tens of
thousands have died in recent years.
Hutu rebels continue to battle the Tutsi-dominated military, with
hundreds of thousands of civilians forced to flee their homes.
In Rwanda, covert attacks on rural villages by Zaire-based Hutu rebels
continue to take place more than two years after a massacre in which an
estimated 500,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus died.
