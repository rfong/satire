S. Africa to Step up Sex Education 
South Africa has adopted a recommendation to intensify sex education
that covers not only the physical aspect but all the areas, said South
African Education Minister Kader Asmal in Pretoria on Monday.
A national focus will be given to highlight the importance of
responsible parenthood, respect for young girls and the prevention of
teenage pregnancies to curb the rocketing HIV infection rate among
adolescents, he said.
According to the minister, the level of HIV infection among adolescents
aged younger than 20 had risen from six percent in 1994 to 21 percent
in 1998.
About 60 percent of all new HIV infections are among those aged between
15 and 24, he said.
Describing the figures as frightening, Asmal said sex education at
school would be stepped up to promote a healthy lifestyle.
"The purpose of sex education is really health education and the
prevention of unwanted pregnancies," he said.
He said the council of education ministers is intended to hold a
workshop with churches, trade unions, business and non- government
bodies.
"The role of the churches could be very important because the future of
our children is at stake," he stressed.
