New Zealand Likely to Suffer Wool Income Drop 
New Zealand is likely to have an 80 million NZ dollar (40 million U.S.
dollar) drop in wool income this selling season, New Zealand Herald
reported recently.
The Auckland-based newspaper quoted the chairman of the NZ Wool Board,
Bruce Munro, as saying that it had been thought that average prices of
wool might rise from 450 cents a kilogram last season to 465 cents.
"But it is reasonably clear that won't be achieved," he said.
A 15 percent drop in prices to an average of 415 cents a kilogram was
more likely which would reduce export earnings from wool to under 900
million NZ dollars (450 million U.S. dollars) annually, Munro
predicted.
Lower demand for high quality clothing from Asian customers was already
having a strong influence, he noted.
"We will have to further tighten our belt," he said.
