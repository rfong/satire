Indonesia Understands Malaysia's Border Closure
Jakarta understands Malaysia's decision to close 12 check points on its
land borders with Indonesia on Borneo island, a senior Foreign Ministry
official said.
The Malaysian government's action appeared to be intended to protect
its internal security in light of recent mass riots in the Indonesian
province of West Kalimantan which shares a land border with Malaysia's
Sarawak state, Izhar Ibrahim, the ministry's director general of
political affairs said here last night.
Over the weekend, Malaysia closed off 12 border posts in the south
Sarawak which borders two Indonesian provinces.
The sudden closure stranded several hundred Indonesians working or
traveling to neighboring Sarawak.
Riots triggered by inter-ethnic friction erupted in Sangau Ledo, West
Kalimantan, last December 3 and lasted until January 2. They caused a
considerable damage to the people's property and claimed a number of
human lives.
In recent days, dozens of soldiers have been deployed to the west
Kalimantan province to ensure security, and the scope of a curfew has
been extended, after the wave of violence in some local districts.
The military presence was introduced following the arrest of 11 people
linked with the unrest and widespread rumors that further riots would
occur in the province.
Izhar could not predict when the crossing points would be reopened.
Jakarta would like to see the crossing points reopened once the unrest
has subsided, he said.
