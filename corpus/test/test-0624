Homeowners who suffered damage from the flooding in Southern California
may be facing more bad news: their losses probably are not covered by
insurance.
Home insurance companies exclude coverage for flooding -- as they do
for earthquakes -- from standard homeowners policies.
Only the federal government offers flood coverage through the National
Flood Insurance Program, and only a fraction of homeowners actually
purchase the policies, leaving most vulnerable to flood losses.
According to Jack Eldridge, western chief for the National Flood
Insurance Program, only about 24 percent of those living in flood zones
actually purchase coverage.
Below are the answers to some common questions about flood insurance
and how to buy it:
-- What kind of rain damage is covered by my standard homeowners
insurance and what is not?
Leaky roofs, fallen trees and damage from pounding rain or hail is
covered by most standard homeowners policies. But damage from rising
water, such as overflow from streets or rivers, is not covered.
Flooding and mudslides from mountains or hills also is excluded by
standard policies. Even water run-off into a basement usually is
considered flooding and thereby not covered by standard homeowners
policies.
-- Why don't insurance companies cover flooding?
Floods are considered special risks that are not common enough to be
part of a standard homeowners policy. Companies don't offer the
coverage because it is difficult and costly to determine who might be
at risk for flooding or mudslides and, as a result, the cost of such
coverage would be high. Not all homeowners would want to pay it.
-- Is my business covered for flooding?
Not unless you bought a separate flood policy. A standard business
insurance policy -- like a standard homeowners policy -- will not cover
flooding damage to property or inventory. However, if you were forced
to close your business during the storms due to damage, you may be able
to make a claim for ``business interruption,'' if your policy features
such a provision.
-- Where can I get flood insurance?
In 1968, the federal government launched the National Flood Insurance
Program to cover flooding and related damage, but it does not cover
mudslides or landslides. The program is managed by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. It covers 209,000 homeowners in
California.
-- Who can buy it?
Homeowners must live in a city or county that participates in the
federal program by complying with flood management standards. Nearly
all communities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties participate, with
the exception of Vernon, Temple City, Huntington Park and El Monte.
-- How can I buy flood insurance?
Most licensed insurance agents and companies participate in the flood
insurance program. Contact your agent for information and coverage.
Currently, there is a five-day waiting period before coverage will be
issued, but that will be extended to 30 days effective March 1.
-- How much does it cost?
Premiums are based upon the replacement value of the home and where it
is. The flood program has identified special flood hazard areas in
every community where rates area higher. The maximum insurable
replacement value of a home is $185,000, though that cap will rise to
$250,000 effective March 1. According to Federal Emergency Management
Agency, the annual costs range from $300 to $500 nationwide. In
California, the average cost is $365, according to the Western
Insurance Information Service, an industry trade group.
-- How do I find out if I live in a special flood hazard area?
City or county planning offices should have a flood insurance rate map
that identifies high risk areas. Some insurance agents or companies
also have maps for the areas they represent.
