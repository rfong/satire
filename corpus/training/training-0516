White House, Congress Try to Resume Budget Talks 
The White House and congressional Republicans are trying to re-start
balanced budget talks on Thursday, in an effort to end the partial
government shutdown which has entered into sixth day.
White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Pete V. Domenici and House Budget Chairman John Kasich, met on
Thursday morning.
Domenici told reporters the group had "made some progress".
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said that they had agreed on a work
plan for today involving chief negotiators for the White House and
Congress.
But McCurry indicated a temporary spending bill was not part of today's
agreement and it was unlikely that President Bill Clinton would sit
down during the day with Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole or House
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
House-passed legislation to assure timely benefits checks for 3.3
million veterans and their survivors awaited Senate action. And House
officials said they were considering a follow-up measure to make sure
welfare funding goes out on time to the states, as well, so they can
send checks to 13 million recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent
Children.
