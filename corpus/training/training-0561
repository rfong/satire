Israel shells south Lebanon village 
The Israeli army and its proxy militia shelled the south Lebanon
village of Zibqine, two kilometres (one mile) outside the
Israeli-occupied buffer zone, on Tuesday, Lebanese police said.
"Heavy artillery in the occupied zone fired around 30 shells at Zibqine
at dawn. Three houses were badly damaged," a police officer said,
without giving details of any casualties.
"A family of four just escaped death when a shell destroyed three rooms
in their home but left the bedroom where they were sleeping intact," he
added.
UN peacekeepers in Zibqine, south of Tyre, confirmed the shelling but
gave no details.
It came a day after Hezbollah guerrillas killed an officer in Israel's
proxy South Lebanon Army militia by blowing up his car inside the
Israeli-occupied "security zone."
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, making his first visit to
the zone Monday since he took office in June, had already warned
Lebanon that its people would suffer for any escalating violence in the
south.
"We must find a way to resolve this conflict. If it degenerates, it
will be very painful, especially for the other side," he said.
