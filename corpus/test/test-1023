Greek PM Vows to Have Safe 2004 Olympic Games 
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said on Thursday that his country
will continue fighting terrorism for a safe Olympics in 2004.
"(The government) has an ongoing fight against terrorism and we will do
everything to rid ourselves of terrorists," Simitis said during a
foreign press luncheon.
Safety during the Games has been a major concern for the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Greek government, especially since the
killing of a British diplomat in June.
Urban guerrilla group November 17, which has been operating with
impunity since 1975, gunned down British Embassy defence attache
Stephen Saunders. He was the 23rd victim in 25 years.
Simitis said the existence of a guerrilla group in an Olympics host
country did not necessarily mean terrorist attacks during the Games.
"Barcelona feared terrorist attacks and there were none. In Atlanta
there was a terrorist incident although there was no initial fear of
that," he said.
