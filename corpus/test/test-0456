Sony, Matsushita to Sell Digital Camcorders
With sales of regular camcorders slowing, Japan's electronics companies
are introducing a new format that uses digital technology to boost
picture quality and, they hope, sales.
Sony Corp. said Monday it will begin selling two digital camcorder
models in Japan in September. The machines, which couple a video camera
and a small video cassette recorder in a hand-held unit, will go on
sale overseas later this year, it said.
The camcorders will have the highest picture quality available in a
consumer model, Sony said.
Digital technology allows greater sharpness and reduces the level of
picture noise and distortion _ much in the same way digital recording
improves the quality of sound on compact discs. Digital video tapes
also can be copied repeatedly with little loss of quality.
The Sony digital camcorders are about the same size as the company's
regular 8mm camcorders, but use smaller tape cassettes just 66
millimeters (2 1/2 inches) wide _ about half the size of an audio
cassette.
In a demonstration Monday, video images playing from a digital
camcorder were crisp and clear, even on a large-screen television.
The digital format was agreed to by 55 Japanese and foreign companies
at a conference in April 1994, and Sony officials said they hope it
will be widely adopted.
Sony's 8mm format, introduced in 1985, was also formally accepted by
scores of companies, but few actually manufactured and marketed it. Its
biggest competition continues to be the VHS-C format backed by Sony's
chief rival, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
This time, however, Matsushita, the world's largest consumer
electronics maker, says it plans to join the digital camcorder camp
with a model to be announced next week. Other companies are expected to
follow suit.
Sony said its two models will sell in Japan for 235,000 yen and 350,000
yen (dlrs 2,675 and dlrs 4,000). Because of the steep prices, it plans
to target semi-professionals and photo journalists, and will continue
to market its lower-cost 8mm camcorders as well.
``We don't see the formats as competing against each other,'' said
Yukio Kubota, a manager in Sony's Video Technology Center.
The digital camcorders each weigh roughly 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds).
The cassettes currently can hold up to one hour of video. Each has a
tiny built-in semiconductor memory chip that stores information such as
the recording date and time, and allows users to quickly locate the
section of a tape they wish to view.
Sales of regular camcorders, once a cash cow for Japanese electronics
companies, have slowed in recent years because of stagnant economic
conditions and market saturation. Japanese-made models also have lost
some of their competitiveness because of the high yen, which makes
Japanese products more expensive overseas.
