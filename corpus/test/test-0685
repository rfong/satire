Voter registration makes uneven start 
Voter registration in preparation for Mozambique's first democratic
elections got off to a slow and uneven start with one voter
registration post set on fire by a former rebel, the Noticias daily
reported Thursday.
Registration officers from the country's 11 provinces told the
newspaper that registration, which was launched by President Joaquim
Chissano Wednesday, had begun in most districts in the north and south,
but in only half of the central Sofala province.
In the central Zambezia province district of Gile, a local delegate
from the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) former rebels
deliberately set fire to a registration post and tried in vain to stop
the registration officers from working.
This was apparently the only incident marring the kick-off for
elections scheduled for October and the RENAMO delegate responsible -
who claimed he was acting on higher orders - was quickly arrested by
the police.
On Wednesday, Chissano urged all Mozambicans to fulfil their civil
right and duty, when he launched a nationwide campaign to register some
8.5 million potential voters.
The delayed start to registration in other parts of the country is
mainly due to logistical problems such as lack of transport or safe
places to house the registration equipment and material.
Meanwhile the open registration centres saw a relatively low turn-out
of people coming to register. The registration process is to be
complete by mid-August.
Some National Elections Commission officials suggest the slow start is
partly due to lack of public awareness on voter registration.
