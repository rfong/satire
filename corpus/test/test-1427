England Fans Criticise World Cup Policing
The Football Supporters' Association (FSA) slammed on Thursday the policing
of England fans during the World Cup finals in France last summer.
It also described the ticket distribution system at the tournament in
France as "disgraceful".
FSA presented a detailed report on what it called the "Fans' View" of
the finals to the British government's Football Task Force and English
soccer officials.
The findings in the 32-page report were based on information from FSA
observers at the tournament and questionnaires completed by around 500
fans.
"The report slams the disgraceful ticket distribution system which
forced thousands of fans to pay extortionate black market ticket
prices," the FSA said in a statement.
"It exposes the media's role in inflaming problem situations. It
criticises the policing of England fans which punished the vast
majority of innocent fans whilst failing to deal with troublemakers."
English fans complained before the tournament that not enough tickets
had been made available to fans outside of France. English hooligans
were involved in trouble during the tournament, notably in Marseille.
The report contains witness statements alleging incidents of media
personnel paying both English and French fans to throw missiles and
burn flags.
"This is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the real
experiences of our supporters abroad," said Kevin Miles, the author of
the report.
"The existence of the massive black market is proof in itself t hat the
ticket system failed to put the tickets into the hands of genuine fans
who wanted to see the matches.
"Authorities need to listen to these fans if the mistakes of this
tournament are not be repeated in the future."
