Pentagon Concerned Over Problem in New F-18E/F Fighter 
The U.S. Department of Defense said on Thursday that its leaders are
concerned over a wing problem in the new F-18E/F Navy fighter built by
Boeing Co. and consultations among the top leaders are held on the
program.
Boeing is expected to deliver 780 of the carrier-based attack jets to
the Navy over the next 10 to 15 years at a cost of up to 80 billion
U.S. dollars.
But reports revealed that the "Super Hornet" strike fighter being
tested by the Navy and Boeing has shown a wing problem that may cause
it to bank unexpectedly during certain maneuvers at just below the
speed of sound.
Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon said today that Secretary of
Defense William Cohen concerned about the problem. "He wants to find
out how serious the problem is. And he wants to find out what can be
done to fix it," Bacon said.
Cohen had discussed the problem with Navy Secretary John Dalton, Chief
of Naval Operations Adm. Jay Johnson and Under-Secretary of Defense
Jacques Gansler, the top acquisition and technology official at the
Pentagon, the spokesman said.
The new aircraft is designed to bridge the gap between current aging
U.S. carrier-based attack jets, including older-model F-18s, and the
expected eventual emergence of a U.S. "Joint Strike Fighter" that could
be shared by the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, it was reported.
