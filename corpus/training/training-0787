Families identify 34 bodies from Croatian mass grave 
Thirty-four bodies exhumed from a mass grave near Vukovar in eastern
Croatia have been identified by the victims' families, a top forensic
expert said Tuesday.
The bodies were among 200 exhumed last year by experts working for the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague from a mass grave near
the village of Ovcara, in Serb-held Eastern Slavonia.
Tribunal experts have said that the grave contained the bodies of
people who disappeared from Vukovar hospital when the town was captured
by the Serbs after a bloody siege ending in November 1991.
Three former Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officers have been indicted
by the tribunal over the killings. They are General Mile Mrksic, Major
Veselin Sljivancanin and Captain Miroslav Radic.
The patients were supposed to have been transferred to other Croatian
hospitals according to an agreement between the International Committee
of the Red Cross and the JNA.
Davor Strinovic, head of the Croatian Forensic Institute, said that the
34 identified were among 60 bodies which the tribunal's experts had
already preliminarily identified.
Identification of the other victims will continue over the coming
weeks, Strinovic said.
The bodies at Ovcara, the biggest mass grave so far discovered in
former Yugoslavia, included two women. The others were all male, from
young boys to old men.
Meanwhile, Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Kostovic said that
Zagreb had offered a documentary of the exhumation works at Ovaca,
filmed exclusively by Britain's ITN news network, to the international
tribunal and the UN's Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia.
Eastern Slavonia, the last Serb-held part of the country, is due to
return to Zagreb's control before January 1998 at the latest under an
agreement between Zagreb and the Serbs.
