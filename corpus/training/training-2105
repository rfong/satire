Indonesia Aims for Two Titles at Japan Open Badminton 
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) aims to grab two titles
in the upcoming five-star Japan Open badminton tournament despite
achieving disappointing results in the previous three opening events
this year.
"The Indonesian men's doubles must defend the title while in the mixed
doubles we have a chance to improve on our result from the event last
year," PBSI's training director Christian Hadinata was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
Indonesia's Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan took last year's men 's
double title while Tri Kusheryanto and Minarti Timur bowed out to
Chinese Liu Yong and Ge Fei in the mixed doubles final.
"PBSI don't expect our men's singles shuttlers to grab the title,
especially after their failure at the All England championships. It
will be satisfying if they can perform better," Hadinata said.
He referred to Indonesian shuttlers disappointing results at the All
England tournament where only the men's doubles, Tony and Halim
Heryanto, managed to grab a title after ousting teammates Candra and
Sigit Budiarto.
Hadinata pointed out that the Japan Open will be the last Grand Prix
series tournament before the Sudirman Cup and World Championships take
place in Seville, Spain, from May 28 to June 10.
However, the ambitions of Indonesia's shuttlers to grab the two titles
in Japan will face a tough challenge from European powerhouse Denmark
whose shuttlers are top seeds in both events.
