Dow Jones drops on higher interest rates
Blue-chip stocks closed lower Friday after long-term bond rates climbed
on news that the number of jobs created in August was less than
anticipated.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials lost 15.86 points (0.41
percent) to hit 3,885.58.
Trading was quiet ahead of the three-day Labor Day weekend with some
216 million shares were traded. Decliners outnumbered advancers 1,065
to 939 and 820 were unchanged.
On the bond market, average interest rates on the bellwether 30-year
Treasury bond climbed to 7.49 percent from 7.45 percent late Thursday.
The rate had fallen to 7.38 percent after the announcement that the
number of new jobs in August reached 179,000. Experts had expected the
number generally to reach 248,000.
But the bond rates climbed back up after a wave of profit-taking as
investors positined themselves ahead of the weekend, prompting new
fears of inflation.
Motorola lost one to 51-3/4, Texas Instruments was down one to 75-3/4
and Monsanto one to 80-7/8.
Warner-Lambert was up 1-1/2 to 83-5/8 following rumors that the
laboratory could be up for sale. USX gained 3/4 to 41-3/8 and Pepsico
3/8 to 33-3/4.
