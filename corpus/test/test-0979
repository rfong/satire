Pierce, the 1995 Australian Open champion who has a shoulder injury,
admitted: "Julie and I did see Yannick about it.
"But it's just an idea -- and we'd like not to comment too much on it
until we've had a chance to talk it out thoroughly with Nathalie
(Tauziat) and Sandrine (Testud) -- and that won't be until at least
December.
Massias said: "After the girls approached me I did have a word with
Yannick about it and he said he was definitely interested. But there is
still a lot to discuss.
"Francoise (Durr) has done a marvellous job as captain and is very
close to the players. She led us to the semi-finals again this year and
with just a little bit of luck we could well have beaten Spain and
found ourselves in the final.
"But we shall have to look at dates and programmes and see if it is
feasible for one person to captain both teams. But time is on our side.
We haven't got to make a rush decision an d there is plenty of time to
discuss the situation with all concerned.
