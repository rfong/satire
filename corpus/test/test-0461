Olazabal eyeing victory
Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal hit a superb seven-under-par 65 at the
Portuguese Open on Saturday to lie just two shots behind Swedish leader
Michael Jonzon with one round to play.
"Golf is a strange game," said the Spanish star, who a fortnight ago in
the Dubai Desert Classic finished joint 12th in his first appearance
following an injury lay-off of almost 18 months.
Olazabal, who feared his future would be in a wheelchair when he was
diagnosed as suffering from rheumatoid arthritis in his feet (a
diagnosis changed last September), scored a Saturday 65 in Dubai as
well.
Of course he can now mark his second tournament back with a win and
even he had to admit: "I have a chance if I play like I did today."
He refuses for the moment, though, to even discuss what it would mean
to him to get back on the victory trail so quickly. "I will tell you
tomorrow," he said.
Olazabal, now 23 under par for the seven rounds he has played this year
(Seve Ballesteros is 28 over for the eight he has managed in four
events), went to the turn in 32, two-putting the long first, chipping
in from 20 feet at the sixth, hitting an eight iron to nine feet on the
next and then splashing out of sand to 18 inches at the 508-yard ninth.
He was joint leader when he made a 20-footer on the 10th but Jonzon,
who hit a 68, then responded to the challenge. He had four birdies in
seven holes from the ninth and after a bogey on the 17th holed from
seven feet at the last for another birdie.
Olazabal shares second place with his ex-Ryder Cup team-mate Paul
Broadhurst of Britain, who shot 67 to step up his bid for a first win
for two years.
They are three clear of fourth-placed trio Wayne Riley, Australia's
defending champion, English rookie Van Phillips and compatriot Mark
Davis, runner-up to Riley last year.
Jonzon, whose best finish was second in the 1995 Dutch Open, said: "I
saw Olazabal's name on the leaderboard and it's going to be fun playing
with him in the last round.
"It just shows you what a player he is and it does not surprise me the
way he is striking the ball. Everybody in Dubai was curious to see him
and I was among those who watched him on the practice range.
"I know it would be a great story if he won, but I will be trying to
stop him doing that. I will be nervous for sure, but I feel I have the
game to win now and my confidence is good."
Broadhurst could go sixth in the Ryder Cup points table if he won and
he, like Olazabal, kept a bogey off his card Saturday.
But the main focus was inevitably on Olazabal, who said: "I feel my
feet, but if I keep on scoring like this I can't complain. I'm far
ahead of where I expected to be at this stage in my comeback."
