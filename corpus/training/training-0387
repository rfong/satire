U.S. Firm Displays Fuel-efficient Engine Device 
A United States-made engine device displayed here today has attracted
the attention of Chinese environmental protection officials and auto
parts dealers.
The small device, which WDB USA Inc. claims is fuel-efficient and
capable of reducing an engine's toxic gas emissions, is manufactured by
Tornado Air Management Systems in the United States.
According to the results of tests conducted by the China National Car
Quality Supervision and Test Center and a licensed U. S. auto emission
lab, the device can save up to 24.1 percent of gas consumption and
reduce toxic gas emissions by 5 to 15 percent.
At a demonstration jointly held by the China Foundation for
Environmental Protection and WDB USA Inc., Chinese auto parts dealers
from Beijing, Shanghai and Qingdao said they are very much interested
in the product's fuel-saving feature.
Auto exhaust emissions are considered one of the major air pollutants
in several major Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai.
