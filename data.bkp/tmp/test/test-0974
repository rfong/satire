The/DT New/NNP York/NNP Times/NNP said/VBD in/IN an/DT editorial/NN on/IN Tuesday/NNP ,/, Aug./NNP 16/CD :/: Spurred/VBN by/IN the/DT Senate/NNP ,/, President/NNP Clinton/NNP has/VBZ finally/RB promised/VBN to/TO promote/VB the/DT Bosnian/JJ policy/NN he/PRP claims/VBZ to/TO have/VB favored/VBN all/DT along/IN ./.

He/PRP has/VBZ set/VBN a/DT late/JJ October/NNP deadline/NN for/IN the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNPS to/TO accept/VB unconditionally/RB the/DT latest/JJS international/JJ peace/NN plan/NN ./.

If/IN they/PRP refuse/VBP ,/, Clinton/NNP says/VBZ ,/, he/PRP will/MD ask/VB the/DT U.N./NNP Security/NNP Council/NNP to/TO lift/VB the/DT perverse/JJ arms/NNS embargo/NN against/IN the/DT Bosnian/NNP government/NN ./.

The/DT embargo/NN has/VBZ unfairly/RB frozen/VBN a/DT huge/JJ imbalance/NN in/IN favor/NN of/IN the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNPS ./.

At/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT war/NN ,/, Serbian/NNP forces/NNS seized/VBD heavy/JJ weapons/NNS from/IN the/DT old/JJ Yugoslav/NNP army/NN 's/POS Bosnian/JJ storage/NN depots/NNS ./.

Then/RB they/PRP used/VBD these/DT weapons/NNS to/TO besiege/VB refugee-crammed/JJ cities/NNS like/IN Sarajevo/NNP and/CC Gorazde/NNP ./.

Clinton/NNP set/VBD his/PRP$ deadline/NN to/TO discourage/VB senators/NNS from/IN voting/VBG to/TO lift/VB the/DT embargo/NN unilaterally/RB ./.

That/DT could/MD damage/VB U.S./NNP interests/NNS by/IN tempting/JJ others/NNS to/TO violate/VB U.N./NNP embargoes/NNS that/IN Washington/NNP supports/VBZ ,/, like/IN those/DT against/IN Haiti/NNP ,/, Iraq/NNP ,/, and/CC Libya/NNP ./.

Still/RB ,/, a/DT Senate/NNP majority/NN last/JJ week/NN approved/VBD an/DT amendment/NN to/TO the/DT defense/NN appropriations/NNS bill/NN that/WDT would/MD lift/VB the/DT Bosnian/NNP embargo/NN unilaterally/RB by/IN Nov./NNP 15/CD ./.

The/DT effect/NN is/VBZ likely/RB symbolic/JJ ,/, since/IN no/DT such/JJ amendment/NN was/VBD attached/VBN to/TO the/DT House/NNP version/NN ./.

But/CC since/IN a/DT House/NNP majority/NN previously/RB voted/VBD to/TO lift/VB the/DT embargo/NN ,/, the/DT administration/NN is/VBZ now/RB under/IN pressure/NN to/TO get/VB results/NNS in/IN the/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP ./.

The/DT issue/NN should/MD never/RB have/VB come/VBN to/TO a/DT Capitol/NNP Hill/NNP showdown/NN ./.

Lifting/VBG the/DT arms/NNS embargo/NN is/VBZ the/DT policy/NN Clinton/NNP says/VBZ he/PRP prefers/VBZ ./.

But/CC amid/IN mumbling/VBG by/IN the/DT administration/NN 's/POS foreign/JJ policy/NN team/NN ,/, European/JJ preferences/NNS for/IN enforced/JJ partition/NN schemes/NNS involving/VBG large/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN outside/JJ troops/NNS always/RB carried/VBD the/DT day/NN ./.

Last/JJ month/NN ,/, the/DT U.S./NNP ,/, Russia/NNP ,/, Germany/NNP ,/, France/NNP ,/, and/CC Britain/NNP drew/VBD up/RP yet/RB another/DT partition/NN map/NN and/CC warned/VBD both/DT sides/NNS to/TO accept/VB it/PRP unconditionally/RB or/CC face/VB concerted/JJ pressure/NN ./.

The/DT Bosnian/NNP government/NN accepted/VBD and/CC the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNP refused/VBD ./.

The/DT five/CD were/VBD divided/VBN on/IN what/WP to/TO do/VB ,/, and/CC neither/DT Clinton/NNP nor/CC Secretary/NNP of/IN State/NNP Christopher/NNP pressed/VBN for/IN action/NN ./.

Instead/RB of/IN lifting/VBG the/DT embargo/NN ,/, the/DT five/CD wagged/VBD their/PRP$ fingers/NNS once/RB more/RBR ./.

Now/RB ,/, unless/IN the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNP unexpectedly/RB accept/VB the/DT plan/NN ,/, the/DT issue/NN will/MD move/VB to/TO the/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP ./.

Britain/NNP and/CC France/NNP will/MD resist/VB lifting/VBG the/DT embargo/NN ./.

But/CC confronted/VBN with/IN a/DT strong/JJ administration/NN position/NN ,/, backed/VBN by/IN congressional/JJ threats/NNS of/IN unilateral/JJ sanction-busting/NN ,/, they/PRP might/MD go/VB along/RP ./.

Russia/NNP will/MD also/RB resist/VB ./.

But/CC Moscow/NNP is/VBZ now/RB exasperated/VBN with/IN the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNP '/POS duplicity/NN and/CC recalcitrance/NN ./.

It/PRP could/MD agree/VB to/TO lift/VB the/DT embargo/NN ,/, especially/RB if/IN the/DT council/NN could/MD also/RB grant/VB sanction/NN relief/NN to/TO Serbia/NNP --/: possible/JJ if/IN Belgrade/NNP makes/VBZ good/JJ on/IN its/PRP$ recently/RB announced/VBN cutoff/NN of/IN its/PRP$ Bosnian/NNP cousins/NNS ./.

The/DT Clinton/NNP administration/NN now/RB has/VBZ every/DT reason/NN to/TO argue/VB powerfully/RB for/IN lifting/VBG the/DT arms/NNS embargo/NN in/IN the/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP ./.

May/NNP it/PRP at/IN last/JJ be/VB up/IN to/TO the/DT task/NN ./.
