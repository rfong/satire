Communist Party expected to name Zyuganov presidential candidate 
Russian Communist Party chairman Gennady Zyuganov on Thursday opened
his party's national congress, at which he will almost certainly be
named presidential candidate.
"I do not think there will be another candidate because we have very
little time before the election and you cannot make miracles happen
that quickly," hard-line Communist Vasily Starodubtsyev said.
A vote on Zyuganov's candidacy in the June 16 poll was to be held
between 1000 GMT and 1200 GMT, officials said.
President Boris Yeltsin, meanwhile, was to announce whether he will
seek re-election in the June 16 poll in a speech in his hometown of
Yekaterinburg in the Urals starting at about 1100 GMT.
"On the left, right or centre, there is no one as strong as Zyuganov,
who is the only real candidate for Russian president," Starodubtsyev
said.
