Osibisa percussionist dies in Ghana 
Ghana is mourning the death of percussionist Darko Adams of the 1970s
hit group Osibisa, who died at New Year while performing in a bar in
the capital Accra.
According to witnesses, Adams collapsed while playing the congas just
after seeing the New Year in. Adams, who also used the stage name Darko
Potato, was rushed to hospital but was dead on arrival. He was 62.
Adams had come to Ghana with London-based Osibisa, most of whose
members are Ghanaian, for the recent Panafest festival of African
culture. The other group members had already flown out of the country
and Adams was due to leave just before his death.
Ghana is also mourning the New Year death of composer Ephraim Amu, who
died aged 95 on January 2. Amu's numerous patriotic songs included "Yen
Ara Asase Ne" (This is Our Own Land), regarded by some as Ghana's
unofficial national anthem.
