12 Killed, 200 Injured In Rainstorms 
Rainstorms that swept through southern Bangladesh have killed at least
12 people and injured 200 others, news reports said Sunday.
Saturday's storms struck Munshiganj, Chittagong, Cox's Bazaar and
Comilla districts with wind speeds touching up to 60 miles (95 kms) an
hour, the weather office in Dhaka said.
More than 2,000 mainly mud-and-straw huts were damaged.
Most of the deaths were caused by lightning and house collapses, local
newspapers said.
Bangladesh, a tropical delta nation, is buffeted by cyclones and floods
every year and hundreds of people are killed.
