Tigers demand troop withdrawal ahead of talks 
Tamil Tiger guerrillas Tuesday renewed a demand for the withdrawal of
Sri Lankan government troops from its former Jaffna peninsula bastion
to resume peace negotiations.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said they welcomed a call
by a human rights group and a Tamil organisation in Australia to reopen
talks to end the guerrilla war through foreign mediation.
"While we respect the desire of the conference (by the Australian
groups) that immediate negotiations must commence, the necessary
conducive conditions must be created by the Sri Lankan government by
withdrawing its troops from the occupied areas," the LTTE said in a
statement from its London office.
The statement came hours after Tiger guerrillas wiped out an army
platoon in the northeast of the country Monday, killing at least 32
soldiers for the loss of 35 of their own cadres.
The Jaffna peninsula is in the northeast.
The guerrillas had also vowed to step-up hit-and-run attacks in the
east of the country after losing control of Jaffna, symbol of the
LTTE's separatist struggle, to the military in May.
More than 50,000 people have died in the bitter guerrilla war since
1972.
