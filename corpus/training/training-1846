Deal or No Deal - Clinton to Blame for Economic Downturn
Rush Limbaugh, G.W. Bush, Mitt Romney, Mark Foley, Larry Craig, Newt
Gingrich, and Cock Robin all blamed Bill Clinton for the current downturn
in the stock market and for all of the economic bad news of late.
They all agreed that the stain on Monica's blue dress has brought about
a serious bout of bad karma for the American economy.
They also blamed Clinton for hurricane Katrina, mudslides and fires in
California, the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle, for losing
the war in Vietnam, for stealing a freight train, and Clinton is also
being blamed for exzema, psoriasis, gingivitis, the plague, and the
death of Cock Robin and not to mention Eddie Murphy's separation after
being married only two weeks.
Bush says he will send his economic adviser to appear on Deal or No
Deal and if he wins that that would solve all of America's woes. If he
loses there will be Bill Clinton to blame.
