Inflation Drops by Half In Brazil 
The increase in Brazil's Special Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA-E)
was reduced almost by half to 6.76 percent in the first half of this
year.
In the same period last year it was 11.78 percent.
These figures were released today by the Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics (IBGE), which publishes the IPCA-E reports
quarterly.
The IPCA-E index indicates changes of the inflation rate by calculating
the variation in consumer prices for families whose monthly incomes are
less than 448 U.S. dollars.
According to the IBGE figures, the highest regional inflation rate of
3.82 percent for the second quarter of the year was seen in Fortaleza,
the capital of the northern state of Ceara. The lowest, 0.45 percent,
was in Belem, the capital of another northern state, Para.
