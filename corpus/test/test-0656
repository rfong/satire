U.N. Calls for Efforts to Monitor Somali Coast 
The United Nations has called for support and co-operation from the
international community in monitoring Somali coastline following
reports of toxic dumping, piracy and illegal fishing there.
The call followed a statement by Captain Edward Johns Jr, who is
heading a U.N. Conference on Trade and Development project to
rehabilitate the northern Somali ports of Bossaso and Bersseba, the
East African weekly reported Monday.
The risk of oil pollution, given the volume of traffic around the Horn
of Africa, was high and possible repercussions great, he said.
Johns noted that illegal fishing was another source of major concern in
the Horn of Africa and required close attention from the international
community as well.
Tuna stocks in the region, especially around the northern Somali coast,
were substantial, he said.
"We know that reputable and disreputable fishing concerns are fishing
in this region, paying no license fees, taking fish and simply leaving
the Somali coast," he said.
"The fact that there is no internationally recognized state governing
this region should not stop the international community from
intervening," he said.
He also claimed that the administrations emerging along the Somali
coast had realized the gravity of the problem and felt they should act.
