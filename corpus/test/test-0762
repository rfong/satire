Nepal where the refugees are located, according to reports reaching

About 50 refugees from Khudunabari camp, one of the seven refugee
camps, were the first batch that were verified on the first day of the
verification, Radio Nepal said.
Khudunabari camp which houses about 12,000 refugees, was selected as
the first camp to start the verification by the joint verification
team, formed in January and consisting of five members each from Nepal
and Bhutan.

in Jhapa and Morang districts of eastern Nepal since they were evicted
from Bhutan in early 1990s.
