Lithuanian Top Legislator Hopes to Avoid Government Crisis 
Lithuanian parliamentary speaker Vituatas Landsbergis on Tuesday
expressed the hope that a government crisis will be avoided.
Landsbergis said Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus and the
parliamentary faction of the ruling Fatherland Union party agreed that
"No drastic steps will be taken" in the next few days and the issue of
dismissing the government will not be raised, Interfax reported in a
dispatch from Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.
The Lithuanian cabinet under Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius has
come under fierce criticism by the country's politicians and mass media
for alleged corruption.
Vagnorius said Monday that he might resign, adding that he was
considering the option in connection with "serious accusations without
either motives or facts" made by the state controller and the
presidential administration.
Vagnorius will not declare his resignation over the next few days
despite "the avalanche of ungrounded accusations," the speaker said.
