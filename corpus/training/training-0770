Ugandan army rescues 45 children from rebel captivity 
Uganda's National Resistance Army (NRA) has rescued more than 45
children during recent offensives against rebel hideouts in northern
jungles, the official New Vision newspaper reported here on Sunday.
New Vision said 49 children, most of them boys, fled across NRA lines
during heavy gunbattles with the rebels last week in the districts of
Gulu, Kitgum and Lira.
The children, who were reunited with their families on October 13, were
part of more than 100 people so far rescued from rebel captivity in the
recent past, the paper said.
Two of the rescued children moved their audience to tears when they
narrated their ordeals with their captors in a Gulu hideout, and
requested the Ugandan authorities to keep them in a military barracks
because the rebels had threatened to kill anyone caught escaping.
Observers here believe the rebels had abducted the boys with the
intention of taking them for military training, probably in Sudan, to
swell their ranks and improve its struggle against President Yoweri
Museveni's regime which came to power in January 1986 after
overthrowing the regimes of former Presidents Milton Obote and Tito
Okello.
The government has accused Sudan of training the rebels and financing
their operations to destabilise Museveni's government, while Sudan also
accuses Uganda of backing the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA) that has been battling Khartoum forces since 1983 to end
domination of the Christian and animist south by the Moslem, Arabised
north.
