S. Africa to Set Inflation Targets Next Year
There was no ill feeling at the Reserve Bank (South Africa's central
bank) about the prospect, and the government was committed to
consulting widely before it was done, South African Press Association
quoted him as telling a media briefing in Cape Town.
Manuel also said his department hoped to table the 2000/2001 Budget by
February -- before the end of the 1999/2000 financial year.
A provisional date of October 29 has been set for the release of the
next Medium Term Expenditure Framework, in which government sets out
its macroeconomic parameters and spending priorities. The Adjustment
Estimates, which adjusts the current Budget, is scheduled for release
at the same day.
Manuel said a few issues still needed to be resolved before a
controversial formula governing how revenue is shared within the five-
nation southern African Customs Union (SACU) could be revised. The SACU
comprises South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.
"I would like to believe that these issues will be overtaken by a
detailed SADC (Southern African Development Community) trade protocol."
