Wall Street ends week up 
Blue-chip share prices were on an upward trend this week but trading
was light because traders waited to see the June jobless figures and
whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates.
The opening Friday of the two-day Group of Seven summit in Naples also
encouraged investors to move cautiously in the market, which felt the
drag of a weak dollar and sell-offs in the bond market.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials closed Friday at
3,709.14, up 62.49 points for the week. The markets were closed Monday
to mark Independence Day.
Investors were awaiting a new tightening of US monetary policy this
week to support the greenback. But the Fed, whose policymaking Open
Market Committee met at mid-week, took no action.
The Fed stayed put even after Friday's jobs figures showed unemployment
unchanged at six percent in June, signalling continued expansion of the
economy and a greater potential for inflation.
However, an increase in interest rates is still possible, and most
analysts expect the Fed to raise them in mid-August when the Open
Market Committee meets again.
Chris Iggo, an economist with Chase Manhattan, noted that the release
of inflation figures next week could give the Fed the opportunity to
intervene.
Paul Mastroddi of J.P. Morgan said he expected short-term rates to be
raised at the end of July after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan makes his
semi-annual report to Congress.
Both agreed that the overnight interbank lending rate would be raised a
half point to 4.75 percent.
"The Fed will have to work very hard to push growth down," said
Mastroddi, especially as other major economies begin their recovery.
He predicted that Wall Street would be weak over the next six months
with a possible five percent correction from its current level and
long-term interest rates will continue to climb.
On the bond market, the average rate for the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond rose Friday to 7.69 percent from 7.60 at the end of last week.
Traders were not expecting anything concrete to come out of the G7
summit. President Bill Clinton reinforced that sentiment when he said
in Naples Friday that the dollar would follow the underlying
fundamentals of the US economy.
Wall Street on the other hand is expecting a slew of earnings reports
beginning next week, and they are expected to be positive. But concern
over the weak dollar and interest rates should keep the market from
advancing, the experts say.
Among gainers, Alcoa, which posted increased earnings in the second
quarter, closed Friday at 78-7/8 against 75-1/2 last week. Texaco,
which plans to eliminate 2.500 jobs, rose to 63-3/8 from 60-1/8. Texas
Instruments was up to 83-7/8 from 79-5/8 and Caterpillar rose to
105-3/4 from 100-5/8.
J.C. Penney, which had poorer than expected sales in June, ended the
week down to 49 from 51-3/4; Hewlett-Packard was down to 74 from
75-1/2; Lockheed fell to 64 from 65-5/8 and ITT slipped to 80-1/4 from
81-3/4.
The transportation index closed at 1,602.52, down from 1,610.47 a week
ago and public utilities rose to 181.72 from 178.16.
Volume totalled 918.7 millions shares, down from 1.27 billion.
