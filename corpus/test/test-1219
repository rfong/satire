Nokia loses 200 million dollar US order as client pulls out 
Finnish telecommunications giant Nokia has lost a 200 million dollar US
GSM network order after the prospective client, GO Communications,
withdrew its application for an operating license, Nokia said.
Nokia and GO Communications had signed a letter of intent last summer
for mobile telephone base station sub-systems. Nokia said when it
announced the order that the deal was conditional on GO Communications
obtaining a license, Nokia spokeswoman Arja Suominen told AFP.
"Nokia was aware of the risk at the time," she said.
