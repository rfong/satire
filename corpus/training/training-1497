IAEA Detects No Prohibited Materials in Iraq 
No indication of prohibited equipment, materials or activities was
detected in Iraq in the past six months by the nuclear monitoring
experts, said the lastest report of the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
The IAEA reported that from last October 2 to March 31, its
Baghdad-based Nuclear Monitoring Group conducted more than 200
monitoring inspections at some 91 sites, 28 of which were carried out
at sites that had not been previously inspected. This brought the total
number of inspections to over 850 since establishment of the NMG in
August 1994.
The majority of these inspections were carried out with no prior
announcement and a number of them were conducted in cooperation with
monitoring groups like the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM).
The IAEA had not detected in Iraq activities, equipment or materials
proscribed by Security Council resolutions, the report said.
Though the IAEA affirmed Iraq's cooperation in several fields, it urged
Iraq to respect the IAEA's and the UNSCOM's unrestricted rights to use
fixed and rotary wing aircraft for overflights throughout Iraq for all
relevant purposes.
