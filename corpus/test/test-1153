Bosnian forces keep up offensive in western Bosnia
Bosnian forces Sunday kept up their offensive against Serb forces
massing in the west of the country, amidst warnings from the UN the
government side faced air attacks if it again targeted peacekeepers.
On Sunday, government troops were seeking to smash Serb forces they
have surrounded in two pockets, a large one in the west at Bosanska
Krupa and a smaller one near Sarajevo, UN officials said.
The two operations fall within the framework of large-scale government
attacks which have rolled back Serb forces in the west, forcing them to
abandon more than 200 square kilometers (80 square miles) of territory,
accompanied by probing assaults along other frontlines.
In the larger operation, UN officials reported that government forces
were massing on the outskirts of Bosanska Krupa, northeast of Bihac
town which they have surrounded. An attack against the town was
expected soon.
UN spokesman Major Herve Gourmelon added that Bosnian Serb commanders
were also concentrating their forces around the town in order to defend
it.
Raising the likelihood of a Serb counter-attack, he said it was
"difficult to predict" when this would take place.
Serb radio in Pale said its forces were preparing to defend Bosanska
Krupa.
"We have evacuated women and children from the town to neighbouring
villages. There is nobody in town but armed men, with their rifles at
the ready," the Serb deputy commander in Krupa told Pale radio.
Bosanska Krupa is 35 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of Bihac town,
from where government forces last week launched their large-scale
offensive.
Bosnian Serb leaders have ordered a general mobilisation and threatened
to strike back at civilian centres if the government offensive
continues.
Earlier, UN officials said that government forces engaged in a smaller
offensive against the Serbs on Mount Igman southwest of Sarajevo had
"deliberately" shelled a UN observation post Saturday.
The Mount Igman operation involves some 800 to 1,000 government
soldiers. On Saturday they launched an attack on Serb positions facing
a demilitarized zone (DMZ) and on Sunday they appeared to have
surrounded a small pocket, after advancing two to three kilometers (one
to two miles) into enemy territory, according to a Sarajevo UN sector
officer.
During Saturday's initial attack Moslem howitzers and mortars, firing
from within the DMZ, nearly hit the UN observation post,
Lieutenant-Colonel Jacques Lechevallier said. This he described as a
"deliberate" attack.
The UN Security Council has called on government forces to withdraw
unilaterally from the DMZ, set up in August last year to stop a Serb
offensive from completely encircling Sarajevo.
Promises by the Bosnian government that troops would be withdrawn have
not been honoured and more than 500 Bosnian soldiers remained in the
area Sunday, Lechevallier said.
Shells landed within 25 to 50 meters (yards) of the UN observation
post, but there were no casualties.
The Bosnian army said Sunday the shelling was a mistake, adding that
firing had been directed at a Serb position 500 meters away.
A UN officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said Sunday that there
was a Serb base near the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) position
targeted by the Bosnian army.
"If UN observation posts or personnel are directly targeted by
artillery or mortar, the UN will have no alternative but to request air
support from NATO in self-defence," UNPROFOR said for its part.
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation planes have on five occasions
attacked Serb positions, but never Moslem ones.
Meanwhile UN Bosnia commander, Sir Michael Rose, and UN civil affairs
coordinator Viktor Andreyev were due to meet Sunday in Pale with
Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic and Serb commander general
Ratko Mladic.
Rose and Andreyev were to protest the detention of four UN soldiers and
their interpreter since Tuesday and the holding of two Moslem doctors
since Thursday, UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Tim Spicer said.
