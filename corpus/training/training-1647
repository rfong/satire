SLORC suffers heavy losses
Troops of the Burmese military junta suffered nearly 100 casualties in a
battle against opium warlord Khun Sa's Maung Tai Army (MTA), a Thai
military-run television channel said Saturday.
Thirty-two Burmese troops were killed and 60 others wounded in a
two-and-a-half-hour clash Friday with the MTA at Ban Pang Ko in the
east of the country, about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the Thai
border, Channel 7 said.
Khun Sa lost six men, the station said, without providing any numbers
of personnel from either side engaged in the firefight.
The station also said that Rangoon troops and the MTA had clashed again
early Saturday in a battle lasting three hours at Ban Pang Pak Kud,
about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Thailand's Mae Sai district. No
casualty figures from the incident were however available.
Since late last month, Rangoon has mobilized thousands of troops to
destroy Khun Sa's army in Shan State. It started bombarding MTA
positions in the border town of Tachilek last Monday.
The internecine war was expected to peak on Monday -- the Burmese
National Armed Forces Day -- when Rangoon would step up its dry-season
campaign against the ethnic minority insurgents, the television said.
Khun Sa is the self-proclaimed leader of ethnic Shan people, and has
demanded greater autonomy from Rangoon. His MTA, which controls great
part of the opium-growing eastern state, is allegedly run by profits
from drug sales.
