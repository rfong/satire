German Government Cuts Aid to Eastern States 
Financial aid to the eastern part by the government of the Federal
Republic of Germany will drop to 178 billion marks (about 115 billion
U.S. dollars) this year from 1996's 184 billion marks (119 billion
dollars), said a senior government official.
If the money backflow such as tax is deducted, only 130 billion marks
(84 billion dollars) will go to the eastern part, 4 billion less than
in 1996.
Friedrich Bohl, minister in the Chancellor's Office, said that this is
part of the government's plan to gradually cut and finally stop aid to
the eastern states.
Bohl did not say when and by which means should the aid be stopped, but
noted that future aid should be concentrated on basic infrastructures
and some key programs.
Statistics show that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany
offers 1,174 billion marks (762 billion dollars) to the eastern states
from 1991 to 1997, or 879 billion marks (566 billion dollars) if tax
and management fees are excluded.
