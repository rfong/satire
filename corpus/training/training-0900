Argentine Steel Workers Demand Governor's Resignation 
Steel Workers in Argentina's southern province of Tierra del Fuego are
demanding the resignation of Provincial Governor Jose Estabillo and
punishment of policemen who, they say, are responsible for repressing
workers.
Marcelo Sosa, leader of the Metal Workers Union (UOM) of Tierra del
Fuego, said today the workers of all the trade unions of the province
will not negotiate with the provincial government until the resignation
of the governor becomes effective, "America" radio reported.
The workers have set the governor's resignation and the immediate
indictment and imprisonment of policemen "guilty of repressing the
workers" as a condition to talk with the province government, said
Sosa.
The UOM leader was referring to police violence against workers of the
"Continental Fueguina" smelting plant in the city of Ushuaia, where one
worker was killed and more than 20 others were injured when police
violently expelled the workers in a labor dispute on Wednesday.
The incident has already caused the resignation of Provincial Minister
of Interior, Labor and Justice, Fulvio Baschera.
The Argentine government has sent Labor Minister Armando Caro Figueroa
to Tierra del Fuego to collaborate in the solution of the conflict.
