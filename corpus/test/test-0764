Yangtze Commerce, Trade Corridor Shaping Up 
Visitors to this capital of Anhui Province, are surprised to find along
the streets so many branches of big department stores of its more
developed neighbors such as Shanghai and Nanjing.
Hefei is only one of the cities representing commercial co-operation
between the developed and less-developed regions along the Yangtze
River, China's longest.
The latest statistics show that Shanghai, the country's leading
commercial center, alone has already launched more than 190 commercial
and trade entities in Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. They
have combined annual sales of 2.5 billion yuan (301.2 million US
dollars).
This year, Shanghai plans to set up eight to ten large shopping
entities and 20 to 30 wholesale and retail outlets.
The less-affluent regions are also catching up with the wealthy ones,
taking advantage of their rich natural resources and abundant farm
produce.
For example, Anhui has invested over 500 million yuan (about 60.24
million US dollars) to build in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai the
Yu'an Plaza, which will be a show-window of import and export
commodities.
The co-operation is aimed at making full use of the abundant resources
and geographical conditions to form a commercial corridor along the
Yangtze River, experts said.
Now already thriving in the river areas are a large number of powerful
regional and national commodities exchanges, including the Shanghai
metal and grain exchanges, Suzhou commodities exchange, Nanjing oil
exchange, and numerous markets of textile and light industrial goods,
including the famous Hanzheng Street Market in Wuhan, a rice market in
Wuhu and the Chaotianmen Market in Chongqing.
