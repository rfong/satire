Washington to protest 300 strategic infrastructures in Colombia 
The United States is to give its first direct military support to
Colombia, financing the army to stop guerrilla attacks on a key oil
pipeline, the US ambassador to Colombia said Sunday.
In an interview published Sunday in El Tiempo newspaper, Anne Patterson
said the United States had earmarked 300 strategic infrastructures in
Colombia for protection, many of them connected to the oil industry.
Patterson said US aid worth 98 million dollars would go protect the
Cano Limon pipeline in Arauca province against rebel attacks.
The US aid, which is currently the subject of debate in the US
Congress, is aimed at stopping rebel attacks on the 772-kilometer
(480-mile) pipeline running to Colombia's Caribbean port at Cartagena.
The project marks the first direct US support for Colombia's military
against the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and
the National Liberation Army (ELN).
The two guerrilla groups, which have 16,500 and 4,500 fighters
respectively, are among 28 organizations worldwide designated by
Washington as terrorist organizations.
