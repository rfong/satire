Thai currency hits seven year low 
Thailand's currency was trading Tuesday at its lowest point in more
than seven years, but it was due to the strength of the US dollar
rather than any weakness in the domestic economy, dealers said.
The central Bank of Thailand's Exchange Equalisation Fund set the
midrate Tuesday at 26.06 baht to the dollar, down from 25.94 ahead of
the long weekend. Thai financial institutions were closed Monday for a
public holiday.
Trading in Bangkok was light in a range of 26.055-26.083, around a
midrate that was at its lowest point since September 13, 1989, a
Bangkok Bank foreign exchange dealer said.
"It is because of the weakening of the yen and the Deutschemark in the
world market since Friday," he said.
Dealers elsewhere in the region concurred.
"It's mainly due to the stronger dollar," a Singapore based analyst
told AFX-Asia, an AFP-affiliated financial news service.
The Thai central bank determines the midrate each day from a weighted
basket of currencies dominated by the US dollar but including the yen
and the mark. The baht has been fixed at around 25 to the dollar for
more than decade.
Analysts and some government officials have been calling for heavier
weighting of the yen and the mark to lessen dependence on high domestic
interest rates to defend the exchange rate when the dollar climbs.
The weighting of the currencies is secret, however, so it could not be
determined whether the weakening reflected any changes in the basket.
