HK Delegation Back From Visit to Beijing 
A Hong Kong industry and trade delegation led by Secretary for Trade
and Industry Denise Yue returned here tonight after a two-day visit to
Beijing.
At a news briefing at the airport, Yue said she has gained a better
understanding of the work of some trade and industry departments of the
Chinese government.
She said she also had very useful exchange of views on matters of
mutual interest with Chinese officials from the government bodies.
"We have discussed among other things, ways to strengthen cooperation
between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong on protection of
intellectual property rights and the industrial application of science
and technology," she said.
During the visit, she noted, the two sides also exchanged views on the
renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status in the United
States.
The delegation comprising officials from the Trade and Industry Branch,
the Trade Department and the Industry Department visited China's
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, State Economic and
Trade Commission, State Science and Technology Commission, State
Planning Commission, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council.
