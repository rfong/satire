In/IN 11th/JJ grade/NN ,/, she/PRP won/VBD a/DT scholarship/NN to/TO Mary/NNP Burnham/NNP School/NNP for/IN Girls/NNP in/IN Northampton/NNP ,/, Mass./NNP ,/, and/CC then/RB another/DT scholarship/NN to/TO Vassar/NNP College/NNP ./.

There/RB ,/, she/PRP said/VBD ,/, she/PRP largely/RB ignored/VBD protests/NNS against/IN the/DT Vietnam/NNP War/NNP ,/, instead/RB spending/VBG her/PRP$ time/NN reading/NN in/IN the/DT school/NN library/NN ./.

She/PRP was/VBD the/DT first/JJ member/NN of/IN her/PRP$ family/NN to/TO graduate/NN from/IN college/NN ./.

She/PRP earned/VBD a/DT master/NN 's/POS degree/NN from/IN Vassar/NNP in/IN 1972/CD ,/, then/RB moved/VBD to/TO New/NNP York/NNP City/NNP with/IN her/PRP$ husband/NN ,/, Thomas/NNP K./NNP McCaughey/NNP ,/, a/DT Yale/NNP student/NN whom/WP she/PRP met/VBD at/IN college/NN ./.

They/PRP separated/VBN in/IN 1992/CD and/CC were/VBD divorced/VBN early/RB last/JJ year/NN ./.

They/PRP have/VBP three/CD daughters/NNS ,/, Amanda/NNP ,/, 15/CD ;/: Caroline/NNP ,/, 13/CD ,/, and/CC Diana/NNP ,/, 10/CD ,/, who/WP live/VBP with/IN their/PRP$ mother/NN ./.

In/IN 1976/CD ,/, Ms./NNP McCaughey/NNP earned/VBD a/DT doctorate/NN in/IN constitutional/JJ history/NN from/IN Columbia/NNP and/CC has/VBZ taught/VBN there/RB and/CC at/IN Vassar/NNP ./.

Until/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ago/RB ,/, she/PRP was/VBD registered/VBN to/TO vote/VB as/IN an/DT independent/JJ ./.

``/`` I/PRP always/RB assumed/VBD her/PRP to/TO be/VB a/DT middle-of-the/JJ road/NN Democrat/NNP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Henry/NNP Graff/NNP ,/, the/DT presidential/JJ studies/NNS expert/NN who/WP taught/VBD her/PRP at/IN Columbia/NNP ./.

Ms./NNP McCaughey/NNP began/VBD to/TO be/VB noticed/VBN in/IN political/JJ circles/NNS last/JJ February/NNP after/IN her/PRP$ articles/NNS on/IN the/DT Clinton/NNP health/NN care/NN plan/NN struck/VBD a/DT chord/NN ,/, provoking/VBG a/DT White/NNP House/NNP response/NN ./.

A/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS before/IN the/DT Republican/NNP State/NNP Convention/NNP in/IN May/NNP ,/, Pataki/NNP ,/, who/WP had/VBD read/VBN her/PRP$ articles/NNS at/IN the/DT prodding/NN of/IN CBS/NNP chairman/NN Laurence/NNP Tisch/NNP ,/, met/VBD with/IN her/PRP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, though/IN she/PRP says/VBZ he/PRP did/VBD not/RB recruit/VB her/PRP as/IN a/DT running/JJ mate/NN until/IN the/DT night/NN before/IN she/PRP was/VBD designated/VBN by/IN the/DT convention/NN ./.

She/PRP attacked/VBD her/PRP$ task/NN of/IN Medicaid/NNP cost-cutting/NN with/IN what/WP has/VBZ become/VBN a/DT familiar/JJ pattern/NN :/: collecting/VBG and/CC digesting/VBG scores/NNS of/IN documents/NNS from/IN which/WDT she/PRP spits/VBZ out/RP factoids/NNS at/IN random/JJ -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC at/IN times/NNS uses/VBZ to/TO head/VB off/RP pointed/JJ questions/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

This/DT was/VBD how/WRB she/PRP tackled/VBD the/DT Clinton/NNP health/NN care/NN plan/NN ./.

This/DT was/VBD also/RB the/DT way/NN ,/, as/IN she/PRP tells/VBZ the/DT story/NN ,/, that/IN she/PRP rose/VBD from/IN her/PRP$ working-class/JJ roots/NNS ./.

Study/NNP ,/, she/PRP once/RB said/VBD ,/, ``/`` was/VBD my/PRP$ one/CD big/JJ chance/NN in/IN life/NN ./. ''/''

But/CC some/DT of/IN her/PRP$ critics/NNS ,/, and/CC even/RB a/DT few/JJ friends/NNS ,/, see/VBP in/IN her/PRP$ devotion/NN to/TO the/DT academic/JJ a/DT distance/NN from/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN of/IN politics/NNS and/CC policy/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, critics/NNS of/IN her/PRP$ health/NN care/NN articles/NNS ,/, which/WDT argued/VBD that/IN the/DT Clinton/NNP health/NN care/NN bill/NN would/MD limit/VB choices/NNS for/IN medical/JJ care/NN ,/, say/VBP she/PRP deftly/JJ dissected/VBN the/DT bill/NN 's/POS language/NN but/CC showed/VBD little/JJ understanding/NN of/IN how/WRB that/DT language/NN would/MD translate/VB into/IN real/JJ programs/NNS ./.

``/`` It/PRP was/VBD the/DT kind/NN of/IN reasoning/NN if/IN you/PRP could/MD find/VB a/DT loophole/NN you/PRP wrote/VBD half/PDT a/DT page/NN about/IN it/PRP and/CC ignored/VBD the/DT context/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD John/NNP Rother/NNP ,/, the/DT legislative/JJ director/NN for/IN the/DT American/NNP Association/NNP of/IN Retired/VBN People/NNS ,/, which/WDT supported/VBD health/NN care/NN reform/NN but/CC did/VBD not/RB endorse/VB the/DT Clinton/NNP plan/NN ./.

But/CC John/NNP R./NNP Zagame/NNP ,/, the/DT executive/JJ director/NN of/IN the/DT New/NNP York/NNP Association/NNP of/IN Counties/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ lobbied/VBN for/IN lightening/VBG the/DT cost/NN of/IN Medicaid/NNP on/IN localities/NNS ,/, said/VBD Ms./NNP McCaughey/NNP has/VBZ to/TO her/PRP$ advantage/NN that/IN ``/`` she/PRP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN tainted/VBN by/IN the/DT cynicism/NN and/CC sense/NN of/IN helplessness/JJ people/NNS in/IN Albany/NNP have/VBP about/IN Medicaid/NNP --/: that/IN you/PRP can/MD not/RB change/VB it/PRP ./.

``/`` She/PRP brings/VBZ a/DT sense/NN of/IN urgency/NN to/TO the/DT issue/NN ,/, ''/'' Zagame/NNP said/VBD ./.

For/IN Ms./NNP McCaughey/NNP 's/POS part/NN ,/, her/PRP$ urgency/NN about/IN Medicaid/NNP flows/VBZ over/IN every/DT detail-laden/JJ sentence/NN she/PRP speaks/VBZ ./.

``/`` It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS interesting/JJ intellectual/JJ problem/NN ,/, ''/'' she/PRP said/VBD ./.
