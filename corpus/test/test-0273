Bangladesh power tower sabotaged 
Bangladesh narrowly averted a new power crisis after parts from an
electricity pylon were stolen and it nearly collapsed, a news report
said Wednesday.
The Bhorer Kagoj newspaper said the crisis was only averted after the
authorities tracked down the missing angles and nuts from the power
tower in the western district of Pabna.
Two electrical standards connecting power lines between western and
eastern Bangladesh collapsed two weeks ago causing acute power
shortages.
The government blamed "sabotage" and extra police and military security
was ordered at 22 power stations across the country to prevent
"subversive" activity."
Five people were arrested and police recovered equipment used to
dismantle the tower, the mass circulation daily Ittefaq newspaper
reported Wednesday.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed's ruling Awami League blamed
arch-rival Khaleda Zia's opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
of involvement in the incidents.
The BNP rejected the charges, saying "the government was suffering from
sabotage phobia and using it to cover its failure."
Energy Minister Noor Uddin Khan said, meanwhile, the power crisis had
eased this week and that it would improve more in coming months.
He said preliminary steps had been taken to set up seven power plants,
mostly with private investment, with a capacity of 1,700 megawatts.
"We need gas and practically Bangladesh is floating on (natural) gas,
but we need to properly survey it and organise," he told journalists.
He said 1,650 megawatts of electricity was being produced but that
there was peak demand of 2,200mw, which could not be met.
Power rationing was imposed in 1991 and has worsened this year.
