Chinese Scientists Win Awards 
Twenty-four Chinese scientists were awarded prizes for their
contributions to China's development at a meeting held here thursday.
Premier Li Peng handed over the awards granted by the Ho Leung Ho Lee
Foundation to the scientists including Qian Xuesen, Huang Jiqing, Wang
Ganchang, Wang Daheng and Chen Jingyun, in the Great Hall of the
People.
Congratulating the prize winners at the meeting, Song Jian, state
councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and Technology
Commission, said that it is a long-term policy of the party and the
government to reward outstanding scientists and technicians, in an
effort to promote the scientific and technological progress of the
country.
The Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation was founded here in March 1994 to
encourage scientists to contribute to China's progress. The founders
were Ho Sin-Hang, honorary chairman of the Hong kong-based Hang Seng
Bank Limited, the bank's veteran directors Leung Kau-Kui and Ho Tim,
and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the bank Lee Quo-Wei, each of
whom donated 100 million HK dollars to the foundation.
