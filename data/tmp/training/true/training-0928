Iraq/NNP had/VBD been/VBN on/IN the/DT verge/NN of/IN resuming/VBG oil/NN exports/NNS under/IN an/DT agreement/NN signed/VBN with/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS in/IN May/NNP to/TO sell/VB two/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS of/IN crude/NN every/DT six/CD months/NNS to/TO buy/VB food/NN and/CC medicine/NN for/IN its/PRP$ sanctions-hit/JJ people/NNS ./.

In/IN an/DT address/NN on/IN Tuesday/NNP ,/, US/NNP President/NNP Bill/NNP Clinton/NNP also/RB dismissed/VBD an/DT immediate/JJ resumption/NN of/IN Iraqi/JJ oil/NN sales/NNS ,/, saying/VBG the/DT oil-for-food/JJ accord/NN could/MD not/RB go/VB forward/RP until/IN Washington/NNP is/VBZ satisfied/VBN with/IN the/DT distribution/NN of/IN humanitarian/JJ supplies/NNS to/TO all/DT Iraqis/NNPS including/VBG the/DT Kurds/NNPS ./.

At/IN talks/NNS in/IN Vienna/NNP in/IN June/NNP ,/, oil/NN ministers/NNS of/IN the/DT Organisation/NNP of/IN Petroleum/NNP Exporting/NNP Countries/NNPS agreed/VBD to/TO allocate/VB Iraq/NNP an/DT additional/JJ production/NN quota/NN of/IN 800,000/CD bpd/VBP to/TO implement/VB its/PRP$ agreement/NN with/IN the/DT UN/NNP to/TO export/VB limited/JJ quantities/NNS of/IN oil/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN since/IN it/PRP came/VBD under/IN an/DT oil/NN and/CC trade/NN embargo/NN for/IN its/PRP$ 1990/CD invasion/NN of/IN Kuwait/NNP ./.
