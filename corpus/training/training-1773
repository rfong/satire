Journalists denounce Kenyan moves to restrict press freedom 
Journalist organisations around the world condemned Monday moves by
Kenya to clamp down on the freedom of the press, the International
Press Institute (IPI) said.
In a statement published at its headquarters here, the IPI said it and
seven other international press freedom bodies had urged Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi to nip in the bud sweeping new proposals to
regulate journalists and news media in Kenya.
The statement said Kenya was considering draft legislation which would
force journalists to register with authorities and impose jail
penalties on those who break a mooted code of conduct.
"Such proposals are reminiscent of apartheid South Africa," the
statement quoted Dana Bullen, executive director of the World Press
Freedom Committee as saying. "No country should invade the rights of
its civizens in this way."
