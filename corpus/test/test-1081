If it's obvious to outsiders that Nick Van Exel, Vlade Divac, Elden
Campbell, Cedric Ceballos and either Anthony Peeler or Eddie Jones will
comprise the starting five, one wouldn't know it from watching workouts
on the campus of the University of Hawaii.
Harris doesn't like to talk in terms of starters and bench. Actually,
he hardly likes to think that way. Harris has had a history of playing
nine- or 10-men rotations, and so far he's been content with looking at
different combinations on the court.
``He's got a lot of options, a lot of different scenarios that he can
put out there on the floor,'' assistant coach Kurt Rambis said after
Sunday's morning workout. ``He can put a small group out there, a tall
group out there, and they can all work with the plays that he's
developing.''
``Size is the most overestimated aspect of the game,'' Harris said.
``Obviously, if you have great size with great ability -- such as
Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) or Wilt (Chamberlain) -- then naturally that's
better. But most guys with great size don't have great ability. I'd
rather go with the smaller skill player than just the big guy with
lesser skills.''
That doesn't necessarily mean he'd start Lynch instead of the 6-11
Campbell at power forward. It does mean, however, that Harris wants to
give opponents as many different looks as possible.
To hear the new coach talk, he doesn't sound like the type of guy
who'll care too much if his starters complain about minutes. If his
talent dictates a 10-man rotation, then that's what he'll utilize.
``For the most part,'' Harris said, ``players never get to play enough
minutes, so you always have that as a problem. But if you get players
who are playing in the area of 28 to 34 minutes, even very good
players, and they are working hard, they are going to feel like they're
playing enough over an 82-game schedule.
``Problem is, players often want to play 38 to 40 minutes, but they
want to float for five minutes.''
``There's a lot of guards here,'' Sedale Threatt said. ``Whatever role
Del wants me to play. If it's a backup, I'll play a backup role.
Whatever he plays me, that will suit me.''
Threatt, who said he would have been surprised if he was traded,
doesn't believe in youth movements.
``My biggest thing coming into this season is just winning. They always
talk about rebuilding, like last year. But the NBA don't wait on
rebuilding. You've got to come out and put your best guys on the floor,
and that's your team.''
