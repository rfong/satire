S. Africa to Continue Talks With Zimbabwe on Latter's Economic Crisis 
The South African government will continue its discussions with
Zimbabwean officials and private companies on how to avert a major
economic crisis in the latter, President Thabo Mbeki said on Thursday.
Speaking at a news conference in Cape Town, Mbeki said the government
would look at means of support other than the provision of financial
aid.
He mooted the possibility of setting up a Zimbabwe rand-denominated
bond, as well as of South Africa negotiating with the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank on Zimbabwe's behalf, "in the context
of ensuring regional peace and stability".
Mbeki said the government encouraged further discussions between
representatives from both countries on solutions to Zimbabwe's dire
energy and fuel crisis.
Zimbabwe has almost run out of foreign currency to pay for fuel, power
and other vital supplies.
Mbeki, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Mineral and Energy Affairs
Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, met Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
in Harare last week.
Mbeki said the finance department had not considered offering Mugabe's
government a loan, as such a move was prohibited in terms of South
Africa's Constitution.
Manuel Wednesday refuted claims that South Africa had offered Zimbabwe
an 800-million rand lifeline to shore up its flagging economy.
Speaking at a news conference in Cape Town after the fortnightly
Cabinet briefing, Manuel said the issue of a loan to Zimbabwe was not
discussed during the meetings with Mugabe.
Referring to the constitutional referendum in Zimbabwe, which Mugabe
lost, Mbeki said the process illustrated the strength of the democratic
process in that country.
