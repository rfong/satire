Turkey could go back on decision to let Israel upgrade fighters 
Turkey may revise a decision to let the state-run Israel Aircraft
Industries (IAI) modernise 54 of its US-built F-4 Phantom jet fighters
at a cost of around one billion dollars, newspapers said here Tuesday.
In December the government signed a decree on the modernisation project
but it was not announced officially.
The dailies Hurriyet and Milliyet said Turkey's military industries and
foreign companies based in the country were dismayed at Ankara's
decision to offer the project to the Israeli firm without inviting
tenders.
Defence Minister Mehmet Golhan, quoted by the two newpapers, said the
project "could be reconsidered" and an "invitation to tender with the
participation of more than one firm could be made."
He said negotiations with the Israeli firm "are continuing, but that
does not mean the project will be carried out with that country."
In January a spokesman for the Israeli embassy here refused to comment
on the project, saying only that talks were continuing.
