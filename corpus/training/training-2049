U.S. Retail Sales Flat in July 
U.S. retail sales were almost unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 291.7
billion U.S. dollars in July, the Commerce department reported Tuesday.
That was the second month in a row that the retail sales were flat,
reflecting the weak demand in the economy.
Year-on-year, retail sales in July were up by 3 percent.
In July, the increase of sales at stores of sporting goods, health and
personal care products, and clothes were offset by the decrease of
sales at gasoline stations and car dealerships.
Gasoline sales dropped a record 4.2 percent in July, after a 3. 6
percent fall as prices at the pump retreated after peaking in May.
Car sales fell 0.5 percent in July, after a 0.5 percent increase the
month before. Excluding automobile sales, retail sales rose 0.2 percent
in July, compared with a 0.2 percent decline in June.
Economists say that layoffs, eroding consumer confidence and stock
market volatility contributed to shoppers being more choosy.
Elsewhere in the report, sales for a category that includes sporting
goods, hobby shops and music stores rose 1.2 percent last month, after
a 0.7 percent increase. Sales at clothing stores rose 0.9 percent,
following a 0.5 percent decline.
At health and personal care stores, sales rose 1.7 percent, following a
0.4 percent increase. Sales of electronics and appliances grew by 0.7
percent, down from a 1.8 percent rise. At bars and restaurants, sales
rose 1 percent, on top of a 0.7 percent increase.
