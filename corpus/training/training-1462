Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Leaves For Gaborone 
Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge left here yesterday for
Gaborone, Botswana, for the sixth session of the Zimbabwe-Botswana
joint commission of co-operation.
The minister is heading a delegation of senior Zimbabwean officials
already in that country.
The foreign minister said in a statement last night that issues to be
discussed would include trade, industry, tourism, natural resources,
agriculture, mining and other issues of mutual interest.
One of the priorities on the agenda is expected to be the termination
of the clothing restrictions which the two countries imposed on each
other some time ago.
Botswana is Zimbabwe's second most important trading partner in Africa
after South Africa.
