New College Students in 1997 to Pay Tuition Themselves 
China will abolish the system of state financial aid for its college
students in 1997, an official from the top education organ said here
today.
To reform the past practice, the state will no longer cover tuition
costs for college recruits, with the exception of those enrolled by
colleges and departments of teaching, agriculture, forestry, mining,
public security and other majors needed urgently by the country, the
official with the State Education Commission (SEC) said.
To date, 60 percent of the students in China's 1,035 universities and
colleges are required to pay their own tuition, which is about one
fifth of their total expenses during their college years, according to
SEC statistics released late last year.
China's universities and colleges will enroll a total of 1.01 million
full-time students in 1997, 45,000 more than in 1996. In addition, over
900,000 others, or 35,000 more than last year, are expected to attend a
variety of adult training schools of higher learning, the official
said.
In the past, Chinese college students did not pay tuition or even
living expenses during their campus careers, but were required to
accept jobs allocated by governmental authorities.
In 1996, the number of students studying in universities or colleges in
China was only 5.68 million -- just a tiny fraction of the country's
1.2 billion population.
By the year 2000, the SEC plans to expand the nation's higher education
system by enrolling 6.3 million students, the official said.
Other SEC officials pointed out that immediate problems stand in the
way of the development of higher education, such as excessive growth of
universities and colleges, insufficient funding and poor administrative
setup.
The SEC also said the dates of college entrance examinations will not
be moved up, and will remain on July 7-9.
