Arbitrator named in French truckers' dispute 
The French government on Sunday appointed an arbitrator to try to find
a way out of a week-long French truck drivers' strike that has
paralysed traffic on major routes.
Transport Minister Bernard Pons appointed ministry official Robert Cros
as mediator between truckers and their employers. Cros already chaired
failed talks between the two sides on Saturday. Negotiations will
resume later on Sunday, the ministry said.
The industrial action, which entered its seventh day Sunday, involves a
growing number of France's 200,000 truck drivers, demanding better pay
and conditions as well as the right to retire at 55.
A representative for management Jehan de Marne of the Union of
Transport Federations said Saturday the employers had agreed to key
demands, including retirement at 55, and could make no further
concessions because of "their economic cost."
The drivers have been blockading roads and barring access to fuel
depots, particularly in the south and west of the country, causing some
service stations to run out of petrol.
