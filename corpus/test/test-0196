Man Arrested After Ax Rampage at California Technical School
A 24-year-old man was arrested Tuesday after a hatchet-wielding rampage
at a technical school that injured three people.
A one-hour standoff between Edmund E. Ygat and police ended when he was
shot in the stomach by a beanbag fired from a gun.
Police say a man walked into the Sequoia Institute shortly after 9 a.m.
and began swinging a 14-inch (36-centimeter) hatchet. Three students
were injured, one with a head wound that required 22 stitches, said
Sgt. Bob Berzin.
Berzin said Ygat was enrolled in the automotive repair school, but the
victims had no apparent connection to him.
``So far he's refused to explain his motivation,'' said Berzin.
Ygat was being held for investigation of three counts of attempted
murder, Berzin said.
Police said Ygat suffered a bruise from the beanbag, a 3-inch
(8-centimeter) projectile police fire from a grenade launcher-like
device to disable a suspect.
