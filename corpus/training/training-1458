Croatia Too Much for Jamaica
Croatia proved that they were too much for Jamaica to cope with as they
scored a convincing win of 3-1 in a Group H match on Sunday.
The Croatian team, making their first World Cup appearence, played
quite relaxed as most of the team have abundant experences in top
European clubs.
They dominated the playing after first 10 minutes and opened the
scoring at the 26th minute through Mario Stanic.
The Jamaican team, the other newcomers of the World Cup finals, fought
hard and finally got their first goal at World Cup as Robbie Earle
headed home a long cross at the 45th minute.
The second half saw the Croatians enjoy even greater advantage. Only
seven minutes after the game resumed, Robert Prosinecki beat the
Jamaican defenders and goal-keeper with an acute volley.
The Croatian team never stopped their attacking thereafter and Davor
Suker consolidated their lead at the 67th minute with a right-footer
which hit the leg of a Jamaican defender and deflected into the net.
Compared with Argentina which beat Japan earlier in another Group H
match, the Croatian team were in better form and have the ability to
challenge Argentina for the top spot of the group.
Croatia and Argentina will clash on June 26 in the last round of the
group stage.
