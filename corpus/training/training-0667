Earlier the "rump" Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, called
for the immediate release of all the hostages and for international
pressure on both sides of the conflict in Bosnia to conclude a new
ceasefire of at least one month.
Yugoslav deputy foreign minister Zivadin Jovanovic said his government
had made certain approaches to the Bosnian Serb "republic" to obtain
the release of the hostages.
Jovanovic, speaking at a press conference in Belgrade, gave no details,
but said the contacts were indirect as Belgrade had cut its political
and other links with the Bosnian Serbs.
The one month ceasefire should be used to resume negotiations on the
basis of the peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina, which the Bosnian Serbs
have rejected.
"The immediate release of all the hostages detained by the forces of
the Serb republic must be part of these efforts. At the same time,
there should be no aerial or other attack on the Serb side," Jovanovic
said.
