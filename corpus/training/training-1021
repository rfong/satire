Suharto Invites Singaporean Investors 
Indonesia on Tuesday asked businessmen from prosperous neighbor
Singapore to help in the development of its infrastructure and
modernization of its economy.
The suggestion came at a meeting between President Suharto and Robert
Chuan Teck Chew, chairman of the Singapore Manufacturers' Association.
Chuan, who led a business delegation here, said investors were urged to
take part in geothermal power, coal mining, toll road, railway,
telecommunication and tourist development projects.
Suharto also asked Singaporean investors to provide financial and
technological assistance for Indonesia's small and medium-scale
enterprises, he told reporters.
Indonesia's ambassador to Singapore, Soedibyo Rahardjo, said Monday
that Singapore has set aside dlrs 10 billion from its foreign exchange
reserves of around dlrs 80 billion for investment in infrastructure
projects in Indonesia.
Chuan said Suharto also invited Singaporean investors to cooperate with
Indonesian airline companies in buying passenger aircraft.
Singapore has a total investment in Indonesia worth dlrs 7.1 billion.
Last year, Singapore invested dlrs 1.6 billion in Indonesia, 14 percent
more than in the previous year.
