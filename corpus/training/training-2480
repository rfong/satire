Bomb explodes as Gaza is reopened 
A remote-controlled bomb exploded Sunday on the Gaza Strip as Israel
lifted a closure on the autonomous area allowing 10,000 Palestinians to
return to work, military officials said.
The blast near the border town of Rafah narrowly missed an Israeli army
jeep. No one was hurt.
The army cordoned off the area near Egypt and launched a search.
The ban on Palestinians entering Israel was lifted before dawn allowing
labourers with work permits to return to their jobs.
The army sealed off the Strip on August 10 following intelligence
reports that a Gazan was preparing to blow himself up in a car packed
with explosives in the centre of Tel Aviv.
The suspect from the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS was caught along
with two comrades on Friday night after a six-hour gunbattle with
Palestinian police.
During the security closure, Israel renewed identity cards for all the
16,800 Gazans who have work permits
