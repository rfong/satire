An Old Style Returns To California Subdivisions
When Travis Vaughn, a divorced father with part-time care of his young
daughter, decided it was time to move from renting to owning, he wanted
to remain in this small Sacramento River delta town where he was born
and raised.
Oakley, 45 miles east of San Francisco, is one of the fastest growing
areas in the state and offers no shortage of new home options. Several
developers have one or more subdivisions under construction and others
are in the planning stages.
But the three-bedroom house that Vaughn will move into in August looks
more like a bungalow that his grandparents might have bought when they
got married than a contemporary home. With its wood siding, brick trim,
large front porch and overhanging eaves, the dwelling is worlds away
from the faceless stucco tract style that has defined California's
post-World War II residential landscape.
``Most people when they walk up to their home want to feel they have
arrived somewhere,'' said Marty Rosenzweig, director of sales and
marketing for A.D. Seeno Construction in Concord, Calif., builder of
Country Faire, the development into which Vaughn is moving. ``They want
to know it's a home, not a rental, and to many people that means the
kind of home they grew up seeing in old movies and television shows.''
Seeno has nearly a dozen single-family home developments for sale in
Northern California, and all of them incorporate what architects have
come to call the neotraditional look.
``People are interested in more traditional architecture,'' said Jeff
Schroeder, director of forward planning for Greystone Homes in
Campbell, Calif., which has similar ``neotrad'' subdivisions under
construction in both Northern and Southern California. ``They're
looking for almost a Midwestern look, something that reminds them of
earlier times and values.''
The trend to a more middle-American architecture began a few years ago
but has really taken hold only in the last two years. According to
Schroeder, to a large extent it represents a reaction to the excesses
of the '80s. ``People are looking for less ostentation,'' he said
``Big, massive homes are out. Buyers want something more homey.''
Gary Gregson, a partner with the KTGY Group in Irvine, Calif., which
designed Greystone's 90-home Windsor subdivision in Pleasanton, Calif.,
said 60 percent of his firm's current residential work -- multifamily
as well as single family -- incorporates traditional elements.
Typical new homes feature steeply pitched roofs, gables, hips and other
setbacks and projections that give the buildings an extremely busy,
some say confused, facade. Accents include rafter tails, shutters,
multipaned windows and other decorative features that began
disappearing from standard California houses 50 years ago.
``We're doing some of the Craftsman-era attitude but in a more
simplified manner,'' Gregson said, referring to the early 20th century
design movement that was popular in California. ``You can't afford to
put in the same level of detail today that you could in the past, but
you try to give a more personalized flavor.''
Although increased attention to architectural quality and design may
appear to make homes more expensive, developers say that is not
necessarily the case.
``The real key is to cut your structural costs,'' Schroeder said. ``If
the basic structure is relatively simple, we can dress it up with
various options that give it character without adding a lot of
expense.''
For many buyers, the most significant of the neo-traditional elements
is the front porch. Until recently, new California homes presented a
generally blank face to the street, with most of the front given over
to windowless garage doors. Outdoor life was oriented to the backyard.
Even the front door was mostly symbolic since residents generally
entered the house directly from the garage. Today's buyers say they
want more sense of community, and they see porches or otherwise
enhanced front entries as contributing to neighborliness.
Not everyone is happy with the change in direction. Goodwin Steinberg,
founding partner of the Steinberg Group Architects in San Jose,
expressed displeasure with current trends, saying he prefers the
simple, clean designs of the modernist movement. Other members of his
firm, including his son, Rob, who now heads the practice, said the
neotraditional trend was too popular to ignore.
The firm recently won a grand award from the Pacific Coast Builders
Conference for one of its five home designs at The Vintage at Almaden
Winery, being developed by New Cities Inc. in San Jose. Although more
Mediterranean than Midwestern in appearance, the winning home features
the same steep roof line and multifaceted exterior that characterizes
the Greystone and Seeno structures.
A variety of economic and social factors contribute to the current
trend. For one thing, developers noted, today's homes are smaller than
those built in the '80s.
``Densities are getting higher and lot sizes smaller,'' Gregson said.
``Typical lots are 35 to 40 feet wide compared to 50 feet a few years
ago. You have to make the house a little more interesting to make up
for the loss of space.''
In addition, with sharp annual increases in housing values apparently a
thing of the past in the state, people are no longer looking at houses
primarily as investments.
``People used to be willing to stretch themselves to the limit to get
into the housing market,'' Schroeder said. ``Now a lot of people are
buying less house than they can afford, just to be on the safe side.''
And with monetary gain no longer such a big factor, buyers are
consequently more concerned about what their homes look and feel like
to live in. ``The idea is to buy something they would enjoy living and
staying in,'' he said.
Dana Stokes, a cartographer who along with his wife, Denise, and two
sons moved into a two-story, four-bedroom home at the Windsor
subdivision, bore out Schroeder's view.
``I'm really ecstatic about this place,'' he said. ``We had a house on
the other side of Pleasanton we were really content with, but my wife
accompanied a friend on a tour of the models and absolutely fell in
love with them.''
The Stokes's previous home was a 1,300-square-foot single-level
dwelling with few architectural flourishes, a pleasant but conventional
tract home of the kind produced by the hundreds of thousands throughout
the state over the last two decades. By contrast, the current
1,800-square-foot, two-story house, which sold for $285,000, has the
kinds of details previously available only in custom homes.
``All the surface edges are rounded,'' Stokes pointed out. ``I do
carpentry and if I were to build a house, this is what it would look
like.''
Stokes heads the subdivision's homeowners' association and helped plan
such activities as first-aid classes by the community pool,
neighborhood garage sales and a dinner involving almost every Windsor
household. He built a cabinet in a dining-room nook and several
neighbors asked him to do the same for them in exchange for various
services ranging from tax preparation to babysitting.
``There's a lot of craziness out there in the world,'' Stokes
continued, noting that his wife's work as a personnel manager at a
county hospital gives her daily experience of some of the worst of
society's problems. ``We're trying to build a community where we take
care of each other, and I think the homes here are really a reflection
of that.''
