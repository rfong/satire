O'Neill makes double transfer scoop 
Martin O'Neill, coach of newly promoted Premiership club Leicester
City, tried to appease his supporters criticisms by signing two players
on Thursday.
O'Neill, a former Northern Ireland captain, bought third division
Millwall's American international goalkeeper Kasey Keller for 900,000
pounds (1.4million dollars) and central defender Spencer Prior for
500,000 pounds from his former club Norwich of the first division.
The signings are unlikely to appease Leicester fans who are angry that
the club has only spent 2.1million pounds on players since winning
promotion to the Premiership -- despite former chairman Martin George
stepping aside earlier in the summer because a new syndicate said they
would provide more money for players.
Leicester were relegated after one season in their only previous
appearance in the Premiership in 1994-95.
O'Neill's first signing was the highly rated 21-year-old midfielder
Mustafa Izzet, who cost 600,000 pounds from Chelsea.
Prior, 25, and Keller, 26, will make their debuts in Leicester's
opening game against fellow Premiership new boys Sunderland at Roker
Park on Saturday.
O'Neill, formerly manager of Wycombe Wanderers and Norwich City, whom
he left last season because of the lack of money available for players,
introduced Prior into the first team there.
Prior, who began his career at Southend, said he was looking forward to
teaming up with O'Neill again.
"I was lucky that Martin O'Neill liked me at Norwich and now he's given
me a chance to further my career at Leicester," Prior said.
