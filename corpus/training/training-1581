Protests Over The Golden Compass
Catholics and other religious groups have organized boycotts of The
Golden Compass, a film based on a children's book by an avowed atheist.
What are their complaints?
Directly competing with Margot At The Wedding, which they love
Compasses inherently promote travel and broadened horizons
The most sympathetic character is not killed in a prolonged and bloody
torture sequence
Golden Compass
Though God is not referenced directly, subtitles pop up on screen to
remind viewers when things symbolize God and religion
Daniel Craig would be better served doing the Lord's work in the next
Bond installment
Breaks unspoken rule that talking CGI animals must be allegorical to
Catholicism
Would have enjoyed some broader anti-Semitic themes
