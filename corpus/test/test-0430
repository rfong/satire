China angry over judging at world gymnastics 
Defending champions China said they were the victims of unfair judging
that put Japan ahead on the first day of the men's World Gymnastics
Championships Monday.
"I want to hit the judge," fumed Barcelona Olympics floor exercise
champion Li Xiaoshuang after getting only 9.375 out of a possible 10
points on his favourite discipline -- finishing 10th.
"It's unfair. I thought I did very well," said the 21-year-old Beijing
student, who nevertheless topped the individual standings with 56.987
points from six disciplines.
Chinese team manager Zhang Jian complained that German floor judge Rolf
Bauch and Japanese rings judge Hitoshi Matsuoka "always gave low scores
to Chinese gymnasts."
Zhang said his team members were given 0.2-0.3 points lower than what
they deserved.
But the charges were denied by the judges and Yuri Titov, president of
the International Gymnastics Federation, who pointed out that a system
for monitoring judging mistakes was in operation.
"The Chinese are wrong," Bauch said, saying he had given the lowest
scores to them only a few times.
"There was nothing intentional at all," said Matsuoka. "I did my job."
Titov said: "Coaches respond to everything very emotionally."
He said the control jury was to review videotape of the competition to
see if there were major judging mistakes and that a computer was being
used to detect any systematic bias in scoring.
As the championships go on to pick 12 out of some 60 participating
countries for full berths in the Atlanta Olympics, there might be more
complaints, he said. "Not so many will be satisfied."
After the first of three groups of nations in the compulsory exercises,
Japan led with a total of 282.060 points, closely followed by China at
282.048 and the United States with 280.336. The optional part of the
competition will follow later in the 10-day festival.
Japan's Hikaru Tanaka and Daisuke Nishikawa trailed in second and third
spots in the individual standings with 56.800 and 56.661 points.
