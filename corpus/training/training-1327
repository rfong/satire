FM Spokesman Calls Britain's Protest Unreasonable 
China today criticized Britain for protesting about plans to revise and
abolish British-made changes to Hong Kong law.
The country's foreign ministry said that Britain's protest on the
revision and abolition suggestions put forward by the law panel of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) were "unreasonable and unwise, and unacceptable to China."
Shen Guofang, foreign ministry spokesman, gave the response in Beijing
this afternoon at a press conference, in reply to a question concerning
Britain's protest on Wednesday to China's ambassador to Britain.
The legal panel, proceeding from the stand of safeguarding the
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, as well as Hong
Kong's smooth transition, put forward relevant suggestions, which were
practical and legitimate, said the spokesman.
According to Shen, the British side, ignoring China's repeated
opposition, unilaterally made major revisions on Hong Kong's original
law which are unfavorable to the territory's smooth transition.
The legal panel, in line with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law,
had to make suggestions for the revision and abolition of the revised
regulations which violate the Basic Law.
"It leads to no where for the British side to impose its own will on
others," Shen said.
Regarding U.S's alleged concern on this matter, the spokesman stressed
that the issue of Hong Kong is a matter between China and Britain
before July 1. Then it will be China's internal affair, in which no
other country will have the right to interfere rudely, and even less
the right to make thoughtless comments disregarding facts.
