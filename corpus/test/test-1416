Hi, my name is Boris
I'm the mayor of London. If I look familiar to you, it is because I was
in the closing ceremony in the Beijing Olympic. I have a confession.
I had two dozens of the great Chinese beer and some drugs before the
ceremony (luckily they did not test me for drug). That's why I looked
like a happy child and the flag was so heavy to wave when it was passed
to me.
I did not button my jacket, as it was too hot for my big belly. By the
way, I picked up the jacket from the flea market. It is a little big,
but the price is right.
If you found any grammatical mistake in this confession, it is because
I just barely passed high school.
If you ask me why I was the mayor of London, you have to ask why my
brother-in-law, a janitor in London, was governor of Hong Kong.
How many Briton can make all Britons ugly and stupid in 8 minutes? I'm
the only one and for that I should get a gold medal.
