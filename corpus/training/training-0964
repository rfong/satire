Hellfire Club warns 1998 Good Friday IRA Agreement signed under a similar,
lethal Full Moon
Hellfire Club grandees have warned that Tony Blair's treasonous 1998 Good
Friday Agreement with the IRA was signed under the same lethal Full Moon
that also occurs this Good Friday.
"A decade ago nobody checked the Treaty smallprint that said 'For IRA
read IRAq'," fatso Tory bluffer Nicholas Soames said today, "because
the lunatics were all too smashed on freebie House of Commons whisky
and City of London coke handouts,"
Provisions of the 1998 agreement included erasing all classified
records showing that since the mid 1960s all Irish criminals called the
IRA, the Provisional IRA, the Real IRA, the Continuity IRA etc etc were
merely a flag of convenience for George W Bush's creditors.
The resulting Agreement paved the way for Bush to slime his way into
high pubic orifice in the USA ahead of a program to sequester Iraqi oil
assets.
"Of course other part of that 'For IRA read IRAq' also reads 'and
IRAn'," a Hellfire source added, packing his bag, chequebooks and
credit cards ahead of a one-way trip to a non-extraditable country
believed to be North Yemen.
Lord Levy is 69.
