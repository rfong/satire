Myanmar Media Hails ASEAN Founding Anniversary 
All Myanmar official newspapers today published editorials to mark the
30th anniversary of the founding of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
Myanmar is beginning a new page of history as it is now a part of the
ASEAN, said the New Light of Myanmar.
"We can not and must not expect miracles or change overnight. We have
responsibilities and obligations just like all other member states,
and, as promised, Myanmar will not be found lacking in any of them," it
said.
"We shall all move as 'One ASEAN into the 21st century', as the
founding anniversary theme suggests," it added.
The Myanmar-language "The Mirror" also said the ASEAN member nations
are dealing among them on the basis of peaceful coexistence and the
association is also endeavoring to realize not only its economic aims
but also the political ones and that of security in the region as well.
It said Myanmar is cooperating with other ASEAN member nations with an
independent and active foreign policy, vowing to play role in the bid
to build a united, prosperous, stable and secured Southeast Asia region
by the 21st century.
Myanmar, along with Laos, was formally admitted into the ASEAN on July
23 which also included Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
