Jordan Reiterates Support for Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq 
Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb on Tuesday reiterated the
kingdom's support for the lifting of international economic sanctions
against Iraq.
During a meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al- Sahaf,
Abu Ragheb said that the possible lifting of the sanctions would help
"end the sufferings of the Iraqi people," Jordan's official Petra news
agency reported.
The trade embargo was imposed by the United Nations Security Council
against Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Baghdad says that it
has complied with the relevant U.N. resolutions and that the sanctions
should be lifted, a demand which has won wide support.
Abu Ragheb and Sahaf also discussed ways of bolstering the ties in all
fields between the two neighbors, and the agenda of the Arab summit to
be held in Amman on March 27-28, Petra said.
The Iraq issue is expected to figure high on the agenda of the Arab
summit, which will also deal with the Israeli-Palestinian clashes and
Arab cooperation in the economic globalization.
Baghdad says that the crippling sanctions have left more than 1. 5
million Iraqi people dead, most of them elderly and children, because
of malnutrition and lack of medicine.
