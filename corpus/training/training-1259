England Edges France 19-16 
Weakened by the absence of nine players on club duty, England edged
France 19-16 in a European Championship rugby league game Wednesday.
The nine were playing in the St Helens-Wigan Challenge Cup replay, won
40-24 by Wigan Wednesday, and England coach Ellery Hanley had to field
a below-strength team at Gateshead with nine players making their
debuts.
Both teams scored three tries. Paul Broadbent, Nick Pinkney and Francis
Cummins went over for England while Frederic Banquet scored two for
France and Jeam-Marc Garcia the other for France.
Deryck Fox kicked two conversions and a penalty for the English, who
led 14-8 at half time, and Nigel Wright landed a drop goal. Stephan
Millet kicked a conversion and a penalty for the French.
With England losers to Wales two weeks ago, the Welsh will win the
title by avoiding defeat in the French town of Carcassonne on March 4.
England--Richard Gay; Ikram Butt, Nick Pinkney, Richard Goddard,
Francis Cummins; Nigel Wright, Deryck Fox; Paul Broadbent, Lee Jackson,
Steve McNamara, Stephen Holgate, Simon Baldwin, Daryl Powell (captain).
France--Laurent Lucchese; Jean-Marc Garcia, Stephane Millet, Frederic
Banquet, Pascal Bomati; David Despin, Patrick Entat; Frederic Teixido,
Stephane Tena, Karl Jaavuo, Daniel Divet, Didier Cabestany (captain),
Jaques Pech.
