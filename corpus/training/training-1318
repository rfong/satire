Boy "Pregnant" With Two Fetuses 
A three-month-old baby boy, who underwent medical checks in southwest
China's Chengdu City this month, was found to be carrying two dead
fetuses.
A team of surgeons at the Hospital of the West China Medical University
successfully removed the fetuses from the "pregnant" baby's abdominal
cavity on December 16. The boy is now recovering in hospital and will
soon be discharged.
"It is the rarest case of its kind ever reported both at home and
abroad," said paediatrician Hu Tingze, head of the surgical team. He
added that the cause of the case still needs further investigation.
The fetuses, diagnosed as parasitic deformed fetuses, weighed 600 grams
and 200 grams respectively. The bigger one, 25 centimeters long, had a
well-developed body and limbs, but it had six-toe feet and an
under-developed brain. The smaller fetus's limbs had not taken shape,
said doctor Hu.
The baby, named Li Yong, was found to have a large swelling inside his
stomach prior to the surgery. His parents said the swelling became
enlarged as he grew, even though he looked normal when he was born.
The doctors have excluded some causes of the bizarre case, such as
consanguineous marriage, parental disease history, or the mother's
exposure to toxic, radioactive or other kinds of materials.
