U.S. Firms Tend to Shun Commercial Banks: Survey 
Large and medium-sized U.S. companies looking for short-term credit
will turn away from commercial banks and toward commercial paper and
the capital markets during the next two years, according to a survey
released Thursday.
In the survey, conducted by the Association for Financial Professionals
, senior financial professionals predict that lending by
commercial banks, which now represents 43 percent of their total
corporate borrowings, will drop to 37 percent over the next two years.
This predicted decline is the continuation of a trend: two years ago,
commercial bank lending accounted for 51 percent of total borrowing,
according to AFP.
At the same time, use of commercial paper over the next two years will
jump to 18 percent of total borrowings from 13 percent two years ago
and 15 percent presently. Use of the capital markets will increase to
20 percent of total borrowings in the next two years, up from 15
percent two years ago.
The survey was conducted in December 1999 among senior financial
professionals at companies with annual revenues of 100 million U.S.
dollars or more. Of the 200 respondents, 58 percent worked at companies
with annual revenues between one billion to five billion dollars.

of financial disciplines.
