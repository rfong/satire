Argentina's MerVal index up 11.76 points 
Argentine stocks surged Friday with the leading MerVal index rising
11.76 percent to close at 414.86 points as traders hedged against
inflation.
"Many people are trying to cover themselves by buying shares which
would defend them from an inflationary spiral," said Alfredo Ferarrini
of the Cohen stock traders group.
The Argentine peso lost about 50 percent of its value since its parity
with the dollar was lifted last week. This has triggered concern of a
significant inflationary trend.
"People are seeking refuge in stocks in a disorderly way," said
Ferarrini.
Another broker, who asked not to be named, said exporting companies
were favored as traders reshuffled their portfolios to minimize the
effects of devaluation.
