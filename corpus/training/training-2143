Yeltsin pays tribute to Sakharov, 'professor of democracy' 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin paid tribute Tuesday to former Soviet
dissident Andrei Sakharov on the 75th anniversary of his birth, saying
the late freedom fighter had been his tutor in democracy.
Speaking at an anniversary ceremony in Moscow's Vostryakovsky cemetery,
Yeltsin said Sakharov "showed us by action and not by words how to
fight without compromise for human rights."
"Sakharov was my professor of democracy, the professor of democracy for
all of Russia," Yeltsin said.
Sakharov, a nuclear physicist who helped discover the Soviet hydrogen
bomb, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his human rights
activism in the former Soviet Union.
A bitter opponent of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December
1979, Sakharov was confined to house arrest in the central Russian town
of Gorky where he remained until officially rehabilitated by Soviet
president Mikhail Gorbachev.
Sakharov died in December 1989.
