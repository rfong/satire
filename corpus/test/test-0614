African Leaders Have Come A Long Way Quickly, Says Chalker 
African leaders have switched from complaining about neo-colonialism
and apartheid to focusing on the need for good government in their own
countries, Overseas Development Minister Lynda Chalker said Thursday.
She was speaking at a dinner in honor of Organization of African Unity
Secretary General Ahmed Salim Salim. Text of her remarks were
distributed in advance.
``Africans have come a long way in a few years,'' said Lady Chalker.
``... They talk about good government and economic self reliance. They
recognize that the future of the continent lies in African hands.''
Since the end of the Cold War, the United States, Britain and other
Western countries have increased pressure on the military dictatorship
and one-party states that had dotted the continent to hold multi-party
elections.
``Africans have acknowledged that Africans must take the lead in
solving the disputes that have brought the images of pain and suffering
to the television screens of the world,'' said Lady Chalker.
