Travelers Find Northeast China's Sedan Base Worth Seeing 
The auto production base of the FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Co. Ltd.,
designed to produce 150,000 sedans a year, has attracted the interest
of many tourists even though it is not yet open to the public.
Changchun, the cradle of China's auto industry in northeast China's
Jilin Province, is famous for its imperial palace, where China's last
emperor Puyi lived during the Japanese invasion, and also for its
contributions to China's film industry.
The FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Co. Ltd., jointly established by the
First Automotive Works and Volkswagen Group of Germany, is one of the
most advanced automobile manufacture bases in the country. Total joint
investment in the base is 10.7 billion yuan (about 1.3 billion US
dollars).
China boasts eight auto-production bases, many of which were launched
in cooperation with world-renowned auto manufacturers.
The company has formulated regulations to help prevent interruptions in
production caused by curious visitors. In 1995, 4,200 people visited
the plant as members of the tourist groups.
