Humanitarian organizations evacuate Kisangani 
UN and non-governmental aid agencies pulled out their representatives
from the eastern Zairean city of Kisangani Saturday for what they said
were "security" reasons.
About 50 people left at about 9:00 a.m. (0800 GMT) aboard two planes
which left here for Kinshasa, an AFP correspondent reported from the
town.
