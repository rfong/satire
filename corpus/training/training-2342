decline. After a sudden rally early in the week, prices retreated to
end the week two dollars lower at 385 dollars per ounce. Last Friday
and on Monday, gold was as high as 390 dollars.
According to analyst Andy Smith at UBS, this initial rally was due to
US investors' short-covering, and was not related to the budgetary
crisis afflicting the United States.
But this is not a view shared across the market. Simce Tuesday, the
impasse between the White House and Congress has meant that federal
funding has dried up and government machinery has been paralysed.
This crisis has weighed on the dollar, encouraging investors to take
refuge in the safe haven of gold, some experts say.
PLATINUM: high, then low. The metal mirrored the ups and downs of gold,
advancing intially to more than 420 dollars per ounce before falling
back to 415.
In a study, the group Johnson Matthey said that the main destination
for the metal, the manufacture of catalyctic converters, will become
saturated by over-capacity. In 1995, demand for platinum in this sector
fell by 4.4 percent to 1.79 million ounces.
But overall demand for platinum continues to grow, rising four percent
to 4.71 million ounces in 1995. On the output side, worldwide supplies
advanced eight percent to 4.89 million ounces in 1995 on the back of
rising South African exports and increased sales of Russian stocks.
SILVER: fluctutation. Silver advanced on the back of gold early in the
week, reaching 5.40 dollars per ounce, before retreating to around 5.30
dollars.
