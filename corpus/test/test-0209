Japan to overhaul foreign exchange regulations 
Japan is to undertake a wholesale review of its foreign exchange
control regulations in an attempt to open up its financial and capital
markets, a senior official finance ministry said Friday.
Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of the ministry's international
finance bureau, told foreign media that a report to the government in
June would recommend a "fundamental review" of the foreign exchange
control act to introduce market freedoms enjoyed in the United States
and Europe.
He said that systems in place in France, Germany, Britain and the
United States would be studied as possible models for Japan, but "it
might be uniquely Japanese in the final analysis."
Recommendations would be contained in a final report from the committee
on foreign exchange and other transactions to be delivered in June,
Sakakibara said. A subcommittee interim report was given to the
government on Thursday.
Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said: "Deregulation and liberalisation of
the foreign exchange control system in general are urgently called for
by various industries, as is reflected in the interim report."
"At the same time, the report emphasises the need to sufficiently
consider ways to collect necessary reports and maintain effectiveness
of restrictions in cases of emergency," Kubo said in a statement.
"It also emphasises the need to ensure the soundness of the
intermediaries of foreign exchange transactions, especially when new
types of intermediaries are allowed to engage in such business," Kubo
said.
"I believe fundamental review over the system as a whole is necessary."
Kubo said the interim report would promote "thorough discussion," with
the basic ideas on the major points for consideration to be outlined by
June.
"I strongly expect that such a fundamental review of our foreign
exchange control system will make Japanese financial and capital
markets more active and will contribute greatly to the sound
development of the world economy."
Sakakibara said that final recommendations would urge significant
change to the laws governing foreign exchange transactions.
"We will still have a legal framework to deal with economic
emergencies, but that does not imply foreign exchange (markets) will
not be free," he said, citing situations where economic sanctions
against another country required the restriction of foreign exchange
transactions.
"Reports would also still have to be filed after transactions and if
they were found to be illegal penalties would be imposed," Sakakibara
said.
Kubo said Japan lagged behind the "rapid liberalisation" in European
and US financial and capital markets, raising transaction costs and
leading Japanese companies to choose the most efficient in which to do
business.
