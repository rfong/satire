Israel calls on Japan to contribute to Mideast peace 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin called on Japan to contribute to
the Middle East peace process as he met Friday with a Japanese
fact-finding mission touring the region.
"Any Japanese contribution to strengthening peace and security in the
Middle East will be welcome, especially if it goes to parties which
have signed peace accords: Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians,"
said Rabin, quoted by officials.
The 22-strong delegation, which includes representatives of Japan's
three ruling coalition parties, is in the region to investigate the
possible deployment of Japanese troops as part of UN peacekeeping
forces on the Israeli-held Golan Heights.
Rabin praised the "positive role" played by the UN Disengagement
Observer Force, deployed on the Golan since 1974. Israel seized the
strategic plateau in 1967 and annexed it in 1981.
The premier said that in the past 20 years there had been "no terrorist
infiltration in the Golan and no UN observer has been killed."
The United Nations has asked Japan to replace some 50 Canadian
transport specialists to work alongside more than 1,000 troops from
Austria, Finland and Poland deployed on the Golan.
The Japanese delegation began its mission in Damascus and visited the
Syrian side of the Golan on Wednesday, before travelling on to Lebanon
and Jordan.
It is to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the autonomous Gaza
Strip on Sunday.
The team returns to Japan on Wednesday after which Tokyo will decide on
whether to contribute to the UN peacekeeping operation.
