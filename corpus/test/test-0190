Mexican Markets React Brightly To International Aid Package 
Interest rates dropped sharply and the value of the peso rose
considerably Wednesday on news that a multibillion international
package is now available to buttress Mexico's battered economy.
Stocks, however, closed down 4.6 percent, hit by profit taking by both
local and foreign investors after Tuesday's euphoric advance.
The rate on the bellwether 28-day treasury bills, known as cetes, fell
a sharp 4.44 percentage points at the weekly auction to 32.75 percent,
indicating that some relief is around the corner for beleaguered
debtors.
Interest rates overall soared from around 35 percent annually just
before Mexico's economic crisis broke Dec. 20 to 55 and 60 percent. On
that date, the government stopped supporting the value of the Mexican
currency, letting it float to preserve dwindling monetary reserves.
Rates for longer-maturity treasury bonds also fell sharply as bids
totaled an unusually large 10.6 billion new pesos for 4 billion new
pesos of fresh paper on offer.
Dealers said demand for the peso-denominated paper was great in the
wake of Tuesday's announcement of what is likely to amount to a dlrs 50
billion international credit package to help Mexico out of its
financial crisis.
The peso closed Wednesday at a mid-rate of 5.375 to the dollar, down
from 5.75 late Tuesday. The currency lost around 40 percent of its
value in relation to the dollar since the crisis began.
The mid-rate is an average between buy and sell per dollar, and is
based on quotations supplied by Mexico's three principal banks.
Traders attributed the peso rally to President Clinton's announcement
Tuesday of the new international credit package, dodging opposition in
Congress to his proposal for dlrs 40 billion in loan guarantees for
Mexico.
Clinton said he would implement the new plan by executive order.
The market's key IPC index was closed off 96.19 points to 1,997.79 -- a
loss of 4.6 percent. At the end of 1994, the IPC stood at 2,375.66.
Volume totaled a moderate to heavy 1.6 billion new pesos, on 138.9
shares traded.
