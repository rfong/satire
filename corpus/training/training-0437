Fishy tale at French ministry 
The French foreign ministry confirmed Wednesday it had sacked a cook
for corruption involving supplies of fish served on the ministerial
menu.
The cook was found to have taken bribes from a particular supplier in
return for awarding them the contract for the fish enjoyed by Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette and visiting foreign dignitaries.
Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhard sought to play down the affair,
saying such practices "are found everywhere."
While stressing that such contracts are not put out to tender, he joked
that the choice of supplier was "sometimes influenced by the kind
gestures which they can make."
The names of those involved in the case, first reported by the
satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine, were not revealed. But the weekly
reported that a judge was probing a number of top Paris chefs over a
related affair.
