Formula One's worst-kept secret was officially confirmed Friday: Nigel
Mansell will drive for the McLaren Mercedes team this season.
Ending weeks of speculation, McLaren announced at a London news
conference that the former world and Indy car champion has been signed
as the team's No. 1 driver. He will team with Finnish driver Mika
Hakkinen.
``We are delighted to welcome Nigel to the team,'' McLaren boss Ron
Dennis said. ``Over the years, he has lost none of his enthusiasm for
the sport, and his wealth of experience will be invaluable to us.''
Mansell said, ``Ron didn't have to employ me and I didn't have to drive
for McLaren, but for all the right reasons we came together.''
Mansell, 41, said he never lost the desire or motivation to resume his
Formula One career.
``You can't stop the fire burning if it's burning,'' he said.
McLaren opened negotiations with Mansell after he was rejected by his
former team, Williams-Renault, in favor of 23-year-old Scottish driver
David Coulthard.
The negotiations dragged on for weeks as both sides argued over salary
terms. Mansell was widely reported to have demanded dlrs 1 million per
race, while Dennis offered a much lower figure.
Both spoke Friday of the difficult bargaining but declined to disclose
details of the compromise one-year contract they eventually agreed on.
``In the end we just took the number we were arguing about and we both
decided rather than concede to each other, we would give it to
charity,'' Dennis said.
Mansell, 41, won the Formula One drivers' title with Williams in 1992
and captured the Indy-car championship with the Newman-Haas team in
1993.
But he failed to win on the Indy circuit last season and returned to
Formula One to drive for Williams in the last three races of the
season, winning the Australian Grand Prix in December.
Mansell will make his McLaren debut in the Brazilian Grand Prix on
March 26.
