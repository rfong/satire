Government lifts ceasefire in Bougainville 
The Papua New Guinea government on Thursday announced it was ending a
ceasefire in effect since September 1994 in Bougainville province,
scene of a bloody seven-year secessionist conflict.
Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan said in an address to the nation that
the ceasefire had been lifted and security forces told to "actively
assist" civilian authorities in restoring order in the mineral-rich
island province, 660 kilometers (400 miles) east of the mainland.
He said the cabinet had ordered that the country's security forces "be
greater and better equipped and that we deal with the BRA (Bougainville
Revolutionary Army) elements inside and outside Papua New Guinea."
Chan noted the failure of a series of peace moves since September 1994
and said that "muderous attacks" there had "increased and intensified."
He said the "rebel leaders have completely lost control" of what was
happening.
"Peace and normalcy must be restored with no further delay," he added.
The conflict was triggered by local grievances over revenues from the
Panguna copper mine, owned by Bougainville Copper Ltd. of which
Australian mining giant CRA Ltd. is the majority shareholder.
The mine was closed in May 1989 as violence escalated and developed
into a guerrilla war.
