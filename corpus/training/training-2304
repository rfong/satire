Gary Glitter Performs A One-Nighter In Bangkok
Gary Glitter, the popular English musician and paedophile, has
performed a spontaneous one-night show for airline staff, police and
immigration officials at Bangkok Airport on his way back to the UK.
Glitter, real name Shitter, told his captors that he had a "tummy
ache", but this condition quickly escalated to a Heart Attack, when he
realised not a single shit was been given by the stern-faced Thai
officials.
The disgraced ex-popstar was on his way to the UK after having been
released from jail in Vietnam, where he had been fiddling with
appendages.
Captain Pavarin Chalermsakorn, left, the Head of Immigration at
Suvarnabhumi Airport, said:
"He put on quite a show, but it was a show no-one wanted to see.
Mr Shitter is no longer the leader of the gang."
