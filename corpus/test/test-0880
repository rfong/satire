China to Recruit Ten Higher-Level Judges 
The Supreme People's Court announced here today that it will open
recruitment of ten higher- level judge positions to improve its
recruitment system and the quality of judges.
Li Guoguang, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, told a press
conference that the Supreme People's Court, China's highest judicial
organ, needs judges with a strong political sense, knowledge of the
law, and trial ability.
The open recruitment is meant to get excellent candidates and to
improve the ways of selecting judges. The ten positions are for
criminal, civil, economic, and administrative trial judges. To be
eligible, a person must be a top-level lawyer, professor, or legal
researcher, or political and law-enforcement department official.
Applicants will have to pass interviews and written tests, followed by
a Supreme People's Court examination, with results reported to the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
The Supreme People's Court will publicize recruitment details in
newspapers.
