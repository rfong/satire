Mideast Highway Link Proposed, EU to Sponsor Study 
Jordan, Israel, Egypt and the Palestinians are seeking to build a
Middle East highway to bolster commercial and touristic links among the
peace partners, officials said Wednesday.
Rauf Saad, an Egyptian assistant foreign minister, said the European
Commission will sponsor a study on ``regional traffic,'' which in
addition to the highway project includes proposals for railway links as
well as civil aviation and maritime cooperation.
Haim Eilam, a deputy director at Israel's Ministry of Construction and
Housing, said the study will be concluded in six months.
Saad told The Associated Press that the highway project was designed to
accommodate Syria and Lebanon at a later stage. He and Eilam declined
to provide cost estimates.
``We have agreed on a master plan on roads connecting the countries of
the region,'' Saad said at the end of a two-day meeting of a committee
formed last year to tackle regional economic cooperation.
Representatives from the United States, Japan, the European Union,
Canada and the World Bank took part in the conference.
Jordan and Egypt have signed peace treaties with Israel, and the
Palestinians reached a self-rule accord with the Jewish state in 1993.
Syria and Lebanon have not yet settled their problems with Israel.
Syria refuses to take part in regional cooperation meetings, insisting
its conflict with Israel first has to be solved.
Saad said the meeting also discussed an Italian proposal for the
construction of a gas pipeline linking Egypt with Jordan, Israel and
Palestinian self-rule areas Jericho in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
The project, already nicknamed ``the peace pipeline,'' could be
finalized in three years, he said. He refused to provide details.
