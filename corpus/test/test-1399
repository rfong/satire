Nigeria to Formulate Anti-Dumping Law 
The Nigerian government is formulating an anti-dumping law in a bid to
offset the impact of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement which
Nigeria signed in 1995, Commerce Minister Mustafa Bello has said.
The draft law will soon be presented to the National Executive Council
for approval and later to the National Assembly (parliament) for
enactment, the minister told an on-going national seminar on "the
implication of the WTO Agreement on the Nigerian economy".
He was responding queries on why Nigeria signed the agreement without
considering the impact on the Nigerian economy at a seminar held in
capital Abuja, This Day newspaper reported Friday.
"I understand that the problem has to be given a legislative solution.
That is why we are working at getting a law on it," Bello said.
On the same occasion, Alhaji Umaru Shehu, the national president of
Nigerian Chamber of Commerce, noted that most clauses in the agreement
are not in the interest of developing countries and therefore implored
Nigeria to negotiate the terms with the WTO.
Citing the directive of environmental standards, he said that when
developed countries start sanctioning defaulting countries from next
year, they will also start dumping on the under-developed world.
Shehu suggested that Nigeria should constitute a team of experienced
technocrats to enter into negotiation on the serious problem of
dumping.
During the negotiation rounds that gave birth to the WTO, African
countries including Nigeria and other developing countries were not
adequately represented, he pointed out.
This necessitated the need for further negotiations in order to protect
local industries and the Nigerian economy from the massive dumping of
foreign finished goods, Shehu said.
