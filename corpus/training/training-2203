China Renovates Baoji-Chengdu Railway
China announced on Sunday that the renovation of a 396-kilometer-long
railway section has been completed.
The Ministry of Railways decided to widen the rail route between Baoji
city in the northwest Shaanxi Province and the capital of Chengdu in
southwest Sichuan Province so as to turn it into one with multiple
tracks.
According to sources from a press conference held in the city of
Guangyuan today, the renovation of the rail line, a major state rail
project, is aimed at easing traffic and creating conditions for paving
a continental route that connects Russia, China, Myanmar and Viet Nam.
The upgrading of the line is an extraordinary feat as it spans rigid,
steep mountains, deep valleys and turbulent rivers with swift rapids in
western China.
The project is expected to increase the annual rail cargo
transportation capacity from 11.58 million tons in the past to some 50
million tons a year.
