Britain, Australia, Maldives Condemn Colombo Bombing 
Britain, Australia and the Maldives have condemned the bombing in Sri
Lanka's capital Colombo Wednesday and extended their sympathy to
families of innocent victims in the blast.
In a message sent to Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar
today, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said that Britain "strongly
condemns such acts of terrorism" and expressed his deepest sympathy to
the families of the innocent victims of the deplorable incident.
A British Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: "We strongly
condemn this latest bomb outrage in Colombo, as we do all acts of
terrorism in Sri Lanka and elsewhere."
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said he was shocked and
distressed by the bomb attack in Colombo Wednesday.
"The Australian government has made clear on many occasions that it
condemns unequivocally all acts of terrorism," he said.
He pointed out, "We do not live in a world any longer where people are
prepared to tolerate acts of terror, and acts of terrorism are matters
of deep and abiding concern to the people of Australia and the
government of Australia."
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, president of the Republic of the Maldives, said
in a letter to Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga: "It was with
deep shock and sorrow that I learnt about the bomb blast in Colombo.
The government and the people of the Maldives deplore all acts of
terrorism."
A truck loaded with explosives blasted in the business center of
Colombo Wednesday morning, killing 11 people and injuring 108 others.
Five rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam who carried out the
attack were later shot dead in crossfire with the security forces and a
sixth was captured.
