Boris Yeltsin Left 'Lying In A State'
There was controversy in Moscow this morning over the treatment of the
body of ex-Russian President Boris Yeltsin who died yesterday, aged 76.
According to news sources inside Russia, in a typical show of contempt
by the authorities, Mr Yeltsin's body has been left 'lying in a state'.
Rather than being presented in a respectful pose to enable the public
to pay their last respects, his decaying carcass has been left "in a
crumpled heap" in Red Square.
Known affectionately as the Dancing Drunk, the popular ex-President
enjoyed a full and happy life, drinking at least two bottles of vodka
per day.
Medical staff say that although the official cause of death is not yet
known, they suspect it he may have been blood poisoning.
Doctor Ivan Denisovich, at the Gulag General Hospital in Moscow, said;
"We think some blood may have got into Mr Yeltsin's alcohol stream."
Mr Yeltsin, who is credited with the abolition of outdated Communist
drinking laws, is due to be funeralised today.
