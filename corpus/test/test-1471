Accounts And People In The Advertising World
GSD&M Gets Doubletree Account The Doubletree Hotels Corp. in
Phoenix said Wednesday that it had selected GSD&M Advertising in
Austin, Texas, to handle its consolidated Doubletree Hotels and Guest
Quarters Suite Hotels account, with billings estimated at $15 million.
The decision had been expected. The account was previously divided
between McCann-Erickson Los Angeles, which handled Doubletree, and
RY&P Moss Advertising in New York, which handled Guest Quarters.
GSD&M was awarded the account after a review that was narrowed to
that agency and two other finalists, RY&P Moss and Ketchum
Advertising San Francisco. RY&P Moss will remain on Doubletree's
agency roster, working on local and regional advertising for individual
hotels; those billings were not disclosed. New Shop Formed by Three
Executives Three advertising, marketing and media executives have
opened CMG Communications Inc. with billings estimated at $10 million
from clients like Time Warner Cable, Bulova watches and Schieffelin
& Somerset. The three, all partners at CMG, are: Christopher
Culver, 38, previously president at the Culver Media Group in New York;
Don Moriarty, 37, previously president at Moriarty Communications in
Bronxville, N.Y., and Michael Glavin, 38, previously a senior vice
president and group account director at Korey, Kay & Partners in
New York. CMG has 24 employees at 79 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and at a
satellite office in Bronxville.
