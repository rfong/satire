CBS stock up as Westinghouse said to consider takeover 
Stock prices for the US television network CBS were up Tuesday amid
reports that the Westinghouse Electric Company was considering buying
it for about 5.8 billion dollars.
CBS shares gained 4.12 1/2 dollars, or 6 percent, on Monday and put on
an additional 2.75 dollars early Tuesday to 72.50 dollars before
falling back slightly later in the morning.
The Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, whose stock dipped Monday 12-1/2
cents at 13.75 dollars, was unchanged in early trading Tuesday.
The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times said Westinghouse had
indicated its interest in making a bid to CBS Chairman Laurence Tisch.
Both reports, citing unidentified sources, said Westinghouse was
willing to offer about 80 dollars a share for the broadcaster.
There was no confirmation either from Westinghouse or from CBS.
The Times and Journal said Westinghouse has been working with Chemical
Bank and J.P. Morgan in a bid to raise funds.
CBS has also seen its fortunes tumble this year as its TV network
dropped to third place in the primetime ratings and it lost several key
station affiliates to the Fox network.
Tisch, whose family has effectively controlled CBS since 1986, has
earlier said the company was not for sale.
Westinghouse and CBS already have ties through Westinghouse's Group W
broadcasting division that has five television stations in major
markets including four CBS affiliates.
The companies have a joint agreement to buy more stations, and are
cooperatively selling advertising.
