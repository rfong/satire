Andreotti Mafia hearing adjourned 
A preliminary hearing Friday on whether seven-time Italian prime
minister Guilio Andreotti should stand trial for alleged Mafia links
was adjourned until February 24.
The hearing was opened and then adjourned after Andreotti's lawyers
called for more time to study new charges against their client, said
one of the attorneys, Alberto Alessi.
The 170-page document of charges, which further implicates the life
senator in involvement with the Mafia, was filed by prosecutors
Thursday.
Friday's adjournement was the fourth time the preliminary hearing has
been put back, each time at the request of the defence.
Andreotti, the father of the Christian Deomcrat movement and considered
doyen of Italian politics, has consistently denied the charges against
him and claims his accusers have been paid to implicate him with the
Mafia.
