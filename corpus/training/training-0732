Boris Yeltsin cuts European gas supply
Boris Yeltsin's liver has exploded just days after being buried at the
Novodevichy cemetery in Russia.
Yes Boris Yeltsin has exploded causing havoc right across Europe. Local
residents first thought it was another Chernoble style melt down but it
now appears that years of alcohol build up in his liver has fermented
in the unseasonably warm spring.
A crater three quarter of a mile wide has wiped out the entire cemetery
and shattered windows for miles around.
Reports are coming in that the explosion has ripped through the Urkrane
gas pipeline cutting off vital supplies to western Europe. There could
be dire consequences for British energy suppliers.
A spokesman for Smirnoff said "We are devastated" when asked if it was
explosion that has affected Smirnoff most or the repercussions
throughout Europe he said "neither, we've just lost our best customer".
