Iraqi Vice President to Attend OIC Summit
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadam will participate in the
forthcoming summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) to
be held here in December, a senior Iraqi diplomat said here today.
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Iraqi charge d'affaires Salah
Noori Samarmad said the Iraqi government has informed the Iranian
authorities that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would not attend the
OIC summit.
He said that Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf would
accompany Ramadam to express Baghdad's views at the OIC summit.
However, Samarmad did not specify what proposals the Iraqi delegation
would deliver to the OIC summit.
Referring to relations between Iraq and Iran, Samarmad said that
Baghdad was ready to improve its relations with Iran since Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami has voiced Tehran's willingness to develop
friendly ties with neighboring countries.
He said that the Iraqi government has taken positive steps to improve
relations with Iran by allowing Iranian citizens to pay religious
pilgrimage to the Shiite shrines in southern Iraq.
It is the Iranian authorities that did not issue permission for Iranian
citizens to visit Iraq, Samarmad said, however, hundreds of overseas
Iranians travel to southern Iraq every day through other countries.
The Iraqi diplomat also rejected the Iranian accusation that Baghdad
still holds more than 15,000 Iranian prisoners of war (POWs) of the
Iran-Iraq war, saying that Iraq has released all Iranian POWs.
Iran has said that during the past years, it has released several
hundreds of Iraqi POWs as "unilateral humanitarian measures to solve
the POW issue between the two country."
Iran repeatedly accused Iraq of giving no response to Iran's goodwill
gesture.
