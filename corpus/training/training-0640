Russian Parliament Speaker to Visit Egypt at Month End 
Speaker of the Russian Parliament (Duma) Gennady Selezlnyov is
scheduled to visit Egypt on March 31, within the context of cordial
relations binding the two countries, the Russian ambassador in Cairo
said on Wednesday.
Selezlnyov will lead to the trip a Duma delegation grouping 10 members
who represent key political parties in the parliament, Vladimir Goudev
told Egypt's official Middle East News Agency.
During his three-day visit, Selezlnyov is expected to meet with
President Hosni Mubarak and discuss bilateral and regional issues of
common interest with the Egyptian leader, Goudev said.
The Russian speaker will hold separate talks with Fathi Sorour, speaker
of the Egyptian parliament, the People's Assembly, and Mustafa Kamal
Helmy, speaker of the Shura (Consultative) Council, the Russian
diplomat added. The talks will dwell on relations and cooperation
between the two countries' parliaments.
Selezlnyov will meet with Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid on the
general situation of economic and trade cooperation between Russia and
Egypt.
He is also to discuss with Foreign Minister Amr Moussa the latest
developments of the Middle East situation, especially the Arab-Israeli
peace talks as Russia is one of the co-sponsors of the peace process
and maintains traditional ties with Arab countries.
