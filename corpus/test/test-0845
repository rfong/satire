Gaza Strip on the riviera 
The sufferings of Palestinians on the Gaza Strip were brought to the
somewhat less harsh surroundings of the French riviera Monday, in a
moving drama-documentary at the film festival here.
"Curfew," by 32-year-old director Rashid Masharawi, tells the story of
24 hours in the life of an ordinary family living under curfew in a
refugee camp. It was made before the recent autonomy agreements reached
with Israel.
The film includes the depiction of a house being destroyed by the
Israeli army while Palestinian neighbours look helplessly on, while a
number of Palestinians are taken off for no apparent reason.
The film was presented Monday in the Director's Fortnight selection of
films here, and is also in selected in the Camera D'Or (Golden Camera)
section of the festival, for first-time film makers.
The dominant themes of the 75-minute movie -- above all boredom, but
mixed with the tension of not knowing what will happen next, is summed
up by the words of one of the main characters, Abu Raji.
"That's all you're good at, saying tomorrow things will improve, and
the day after will be better. We don't even know what today will bring"
he says.
Masharawi, born on the Gaza Strip, has made a number of shorts before,
including documentaries for Britain's BBC and Channel Four, but this is
his first feature offering.
The movie comes after the screening Sunday of "Bosna!" by French
philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, which tells the similarly real-life
story of the atrocities being carried out in ex-Yugoslavia.
