Most Icelanders Favor EU Entry 
The proportion of Icelanders in favor of their country's entry to the
European Union (EU) has exceeded half for the first time, according to
the latest poll released by Icelandic newspapers on Tuesday.
Of the 1,135 people surveyed, 52 percent believed that Iceland should
apply for EU entry, three percent more than last year, while 34 percent
objected, a drop of six percent from last year, and 14 percent had no
opinion.
It also showed that a large proportion of those in favor were women and
young people, and more urban residents than rural people held a
positive attitude towards the entry.
