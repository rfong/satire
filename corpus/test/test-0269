Crushing defeat for Zimbabwe's opposition in elections by Susan Njanji 
Zimbabwe's opposition has been badly defeated in general elections,
winning only two of the 120 contested parliamentary seats, as the
governing ZANU-PF walked easily to victory.
Final results Tuesday gave President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF, a
sweeping majority of 118 contested seats after the weekend poll, plus
30 over which the party controls the appointment.
The opposition's performance is feebler than it was in the last vote in
1990 where it came out with three seats between two parties. One was
for ZANU-Ndonga and two went to the Zimbabwe Unity Movement of Edgar
Tekere, which this year boycotted the polls.
The regionally-based conservative ZANU-Ndonga won two seats in its
traditional stronghold district of Chipinge, near the eastern border
with neighbouring Mozambique.
Ndonga is led by veteran nationalist and founding leader of the now
ruling ZANU-PF in the 1960s, Ndabaningi Sithole.
The Forum Party of Zimbabwe (FPZ), once seen as the only formidable
challenger to ZANU-PF, went down badly even in affluent urban
constituencies where it is believed to draw most of its support from
white liberals.
A political observer, Ibbo Mandaza, said the biggest surprise of the
polls was the complete loss of FPZ, which was tipped by many to pick a
seat or two in the towns.
But its leader, former chief justice Enoch Dumbutshena, remarked:
"Given the meagre resources we had, I think we did very well,"
referring to the margins by which the leading party candidates faired.
Although the two leading opposition parties that participated in the
polls tried not to compete for votes by fielding rival candidates, the
results proved the power ZANU-PF party still wields among the country's
electorate. The parties failed to field candidates in all
constituencies due to lack of financial resources.
Only ZANU-PF was entitled to four million US dollars under the
political parties act which stipulates that only parties with a minimum
of 15 parliamenmtary seats get state funding.
Dumbutshena said there was widespread apathy in urban areas, while in
the rest of the country, "people blindly follow ZANU-PF. Perhaps when
they have suffered enough is when they will follow the examples of our
neighbouring countries." He was referring to the overthow of Kenneth
Kaunda in Zambia and Kamuzu Banda in Malawi.
But some commentators argue that it is the lack of formidable
opposition that led many of the electorate to vote for the ruling
party, which has been at the helm since the overthrow of the white
minority government and independence in 1980.
The opposition has been in disarray and characterised by endless
mergers and divisions. It failed to agree on a stance to take on
participation in the polls.
Five parties boycotted on grounds of flaws in the constitution and
electoral laws, while another five stayed in the race in hope of
clinching enough opposition voices to be heard in parliament.
The opposition's failure has also been blamed on the parties being too
personalised rather than programmatic.
It was confident of winning the hearts of the electorate by
capitalising on the widespread discontent brought about by the
market-oriented economic reforms.
The electorate, particularly urban, has complained that ZANU-PF has
plunged Zimbabwe into an abyss, with a high cost of living as a
consequence of World Bank-backed austerity measures, escalating
unemployment, high medical costs.
While election officials say the voter turnout statistics are
internationally competitive, there has been an explicit downward trend
since the last two general elections. In 1985, around 90 percent of the
eligible electorate cast their ballots, in 1990 about 60, and 57
percent this year.
Amid suspicion in some quarters that voter turnout figures could have
been inflated, others analysts say they could be correct, showing the
amazing powers with which Mugabe can mobilise the electorate.
Just two weeks prior to the elections people were not keen on the polls
as they knew ZANU-PF, which had already secured 55 of the 120 seats,
would win. But Mugabe's campaign turned the tide and raised the mood
for the elections.
Meanwhile, Sithole said his party had deserved to win 25 seats if it
was not for voter intimidation.
