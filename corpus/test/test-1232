74 German Soldiers Investigated For Extreme-Right Offenses Last 
A government official said Tuesday 74 soldiers were investigated for
extreme-right offenses last year and he warned against military elitism
creeping into recruits' heads.
Alfred Biehle, the government's commissioner on military affairs, told
reporters that too little is being done to ensure that young soldiers
are instilled with civil as well as military ideals.
He said ``the defense minister should quickly take measures that
preclude an unexamined falling-back on traditions from the time of the
Wehrmacht,'' which the German armed forces were called during World War
II.
Biehle said the 74 soldiers investigated last year had been suspected
of brawling, spreading illegal propaganda, participating in
extreme-right meetings and other offenses.
Seven of the soldiers were thrown out of the military and disciplinary
measures were taken against others, he said.
Biehle said he doesn't believe any of the 74 were true right-wing
extremists. Some were intoxicated at the time, he said. Others had been
misled by ``elitist thinking and an uncritical attitude'' toward the
Third Reich, he said.
``I don't believe there is a (serious) extreme-right development'' in
the armed forces, Biehle said.
But he worried that a lack of supervision could lead to some recruits
admiring the hardness and blind obedience that were hallmarks of the
Wehrmacht.
Biehle said a number of barracks around Germany have martial wall
pictures from the time of the Wehrmacht. One picture bears the title
``Don't Complain, Fight'' and others have similar slogans, he said.
Biehle said the pictures could send the wrong signals to recruits.
``These portrayals could be understood as a demand to quietly accept
exaggerated hardness and acts of injustice.''
