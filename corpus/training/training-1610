Portuguese driver survives six days in ravine after crash 
A Portuguese driver was found alive and unscathed after spending six
days under his vehicle after it skidded on black ice and fell to the
bottom of a woody ravine, the daily 24 Horas reported Saturday.
He was rescued thanks to the curiosity of a passing motorist who heard
him moan.
Jose Martins, 35, a Portuguese national now living in the French city
of Toulouse, had gone home for Christmas. When he was driving early
Sunday his car left the icy road and tumbled down a ravine.
"He was hidden under his wrecked car, you could only see his legs. But
when we got him out, he had no fractures and was only complaining of
back pain," a fireman told the paper.
He was weak and showed signs of hypothermia but was still conscious
when firemen took him to hospital.
