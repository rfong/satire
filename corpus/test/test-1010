Rolls-Royce buys US firm, raises cash 
British airplane engine maker Rolls Royce announced Friday it had
finalised the acquisition of US firm Allison Engine.
The purchase will be partly financed by the sale of shares in London's
Stock Exchange aimed at raising 331 million pounds (513 million
dollars), it said.
Rolls-Royce said last november it was paying 525 million pounds (812
million dollars) for Allison Engine Company, a leading manufacturer of
turbo-prop engines for helicopters and military aircraft.
Allison, which supplied engines for the G-130 Hercules and V-22 Osprey
aircraft, was bought from the Clayton, Dublier and Rice group which in
turn had bought it from General Motors in 1993.
Rolls-Royce is proposing a new ordinary share of 154 pence (just over
two dollars) for every parcel of 5.4 ordinary shares held on March 16.
Rolls-Royce shares were stable at 164 pence at Friday morning's opening
on the Stock Exchange.
