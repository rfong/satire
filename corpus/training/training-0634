Egyptian FM Slams U.S.-British Raids on Iraq As "Negative" 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has criticized the U.S-British air
strike against Iraq Friday night as "a negative step," the Arabic Al
Ahram daily reported Sunday.
Moussa dismissed the bombings, which left two civilians dead and more
than 20 others injured, as "unacceptable," saying that Egypt " can not
understand its purpose."
He said that the air raids "threaten Iraq's security and its
sovereignty over its territory," adding that he will meet Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
to discuss the Iraqi issue.
Egypt's People's Assembly (parliament) Saturday condemned the U. S. and
Britain for the air strike. The attacks were "an aggression against the
Iraqi people," Speaker of the Parliament Ahmed Fathi Sorour said in the
name of all lawmakers.
According to the Pentagon, 24 U.S. and British warplanes struck five
Iraqi military targets, eight to 32 kilometers from the Iraqi capital
Baghdad, using various long-range precision-guided weapons.
The attack, dubbed by the U.S. a "routine mission," was the first on
the Iraqi capital since December 1998, when the U.S. and Britain
launched a four-day bombardment against Iraq for its alleged refusal to
cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors.
This was also the first air strike against Iraq ordered by U.S.
President George W. Bush.
