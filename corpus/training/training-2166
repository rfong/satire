Bosnian Serbs free three, UN says
Bosnian Serbs on Saturday in a goodwill gesture freed two Moslems and a
Croat after holding them for many months, a UN spokeswoman said here.
The handover took place in the US base of the NATO-led Stabilisation
Force (SFOR) Camp McGovern close to the disputed northeastern town of
Brcko, Andreas Angelli said, adding "it's a gesture of goodwill."
Representatives of the Croat-Moslem Federation, which is due to hand
over the remains of a Serb soldier in exchange, were not present.
One of the freed Moslems, Zaim Bisevac, 60, had been held since 1994
for an unknown reason, Angelli said.
The two others, Moslem Samir Saracevic, 30, and Croat Stjepan Divkovic,
44, were both arrested in February violating an agreement on the
freedom of movement.
All those imprisoned between the start of the conflict in 1992 and
December 1995 had normally been due to be freed by January 1996 under
the Dayton peace accords.
