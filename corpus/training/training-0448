Japanese weapons spending to be cut: report 
The Japanese Defence Agency's request for 920 billion yen (9.2 billion
dollars) for new arms purchases in the coming year will be cut by more
than 100 billion yen, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said the finance ministry had decided to trim
the amount for weapons contracts in the government's draft budget with
the aim of capping overall defence outlays in subsequent years.
The draft budget for the year starting next April is expected to be
finalised by the ministry this month.
The ministry is expected to decide against a contract for refuelling
aircraft that would also serve as long-range transport aircraft in a
mid-term defence buildup plan for 1996 to 2000, the newspaper said.
The ministry also hopes to keep the growth of the defence budget
between 0.85 percent, the same level as last year, and 2.0 percent. The
agency is seeking an increase of 2.9 percent, it said.
Contracts for major weapons came to 825 billion yen last year, down 6.5
percent. But the newspaper said this reflected a decline from an
usually high level the previous year when new contracts were inflated
by purchases of two airborne warning and control systems from the
United States.
