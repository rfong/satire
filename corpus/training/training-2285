Smiths singer "devious, truculent and unreliable", says British judge 
Eighties pop hero Morrissey was described by a High Court judge
Wednesday as "devious, truculent and unreliable" as the former lead
singer of The Smiths lost his legal battle over the group's millions of
pounds (dollars) of earnings.
Mike Joyce, drummer with the now-defunct group, famous for its
doom-laden lyrics, won his claim that he was entitled to 25 percent of
the four-man band's profits from record royalties and performances.
Morrissey and lead guitarist Johnny Marr, who wrote the words and songs
for the group's hit records, including "Heaven Knows I'm Miserable
Now", had paid only 10 percent each of the band's earnings to Joyce and
bass guitarist Andy Rourke.
But they had kept 40 percent each for themselves and kept this secret
from their colleagues.
The High Court judge described Morrissey, whose songs became a standard
for disaffected youth throughout Britain in the 1980s, as "devious,
truculent and unreliable when his own interests were at stake".
He ruled that Morrissey and Marr must also pay legal costs, estimated
at 250,000 pounds (400,000 dollars), from their own pockets.
Legal experts say Joyce will now receive an extra one million pounds
(1.6 million dollars) in earnings.
In 1989 Rourke, who had fought a battle with heroin addiction, settled
with Marr and Morrissey for 83,000 pounds (130,000 dollars), and 10
percent of future record royalties, giving up all further claims.
