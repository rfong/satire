Auckland win place in NPC final 
Auckland thrashed North Harbour 60-26 at Eden Park here Saturday to
reach the final of the national provincial championships.
Auckland, much stronger in the scrum and with superior skills in the
backline, played some of their best rugby this season as they
outclassed North Harbour.
They held a 28-9 lead at half-time as North Harbour struggled to
organise themselves.
North Harbour's All Black centre Frank Bunce, still suffering from a
groin injury, was nowhere near his best and Harbour's discipline was
often poor as they conceded penalties and had two players sin-binned.
Auckland scored eight tries to two as they sent a warning to their
opponents in next Sunday's final.
They will play either Counties or Otago, who meet Sunday in the second
semi-final.
Counties, with All Black star winger Jonah Lomu their main attacking
weapon, are strongly favoured to beat Otago who last weekend lost to
North Harbour.
