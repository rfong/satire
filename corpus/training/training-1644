Consulting and advertising have grown 20 and 40 percent respectively,

Residential indoor fitting-up business is growing at an annual rate of

rise to 100 billion yuan.

standards indicates that China has entered a new period, one analyst
observed, and people's lives have gone from quantity-oriented to
quality-oriented.
However, because of regional disparities in consumption and the
backwardness of certain markets, more time is needed for China's new
markets to improve themselves.
Some people are saying that new efforts are needed for the consumer
environment, and that shopping by credit needs to be encouraged in the
housing, automobile, and medical care markets.
