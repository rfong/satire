Ugandan, Rwandan Presidents on Regional Situation 
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur
Bizimungu have discussed regional situation at a border post in the
southwestern district of Kabale.
The four-hour-long talks centered on matters of bilateral and regional
interest, especially the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), a press release from the President's Office said Tuesday
evening.
It said the two leaders reaffirmed that their armed forces will remain
in DRC until there is a political solution that will create a better
environment for the security of their two countries.
They expressed appreciation for the efforts being undertaken by some
African leaders such as President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and
President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia to find a peaceful solution to
the five-month-old conflict in the third largest African country.
They said they are ready to continue cooperation in all these aspects,
dismissing some media rumors that have alleged that there were
conflicts or problems between Ugandan and Rwandan soldiers deployed in
DRC.
On the situation in Angola, the two leaders regretted the resumption of
fighting in that country and called upon the international community to
ensure that the fighting is brought to an end in accordance with U.N.
Security Council resolutions and the 1994 Lusaka Protocol.
Both leaders emphatically denied any involvement by their two countries
in the war in Angola.
Museveni returned home Monday from his three-day visit to Tripoli where
he held talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on the situation in
the Great Lakes region.
