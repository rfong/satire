Russia Chides U.S., Japan Over Planned ABM System 
Russia on Thursday sharply criticized the United States and Japan for
their plan to establish a regional anti-ballistic missile system in the
Asia-Pacific.
Moscow "has not let pass unnoticed the insistent attempts of the U.S.
to expand its military union with Japan by way of setting up a theater
ABM system in the Asia-Pacific Region," the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in statement released Thursday.
Russia is greatly concerned lest a regional ABM system be set up
anywhere near Russia's border, the Interfax news agency quoted the
statement as saying.
"It is obvious that this is being seen as a link in the first
interception echelon of the future U.S. national ABM system," the
statement said.
It warned that the appearance of such a system could " destabilize
strategic stability in the region, destroy the regional balance of
power and trigger an arms race."
Russia said all these fears could be dispelled by implementing its
proposal that a global system be set up for control over the
non-proliferation of missiles and missile technologies.
It called for the formation of a multilateral security mechanism in the
Asia-Pacific Region with "equal rights and opportunities for all of its
participants."
