Burundi force likely to be mainly from Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia
A regional military force to stabilise Burundi is likely to be composed
mainly of soldiers from Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia, experts on a
technical panel planning the force here said Tuesday.
Ministers from five African countries, meeting in this northern
Tanzanian town on how to provide military aid to the strife-torn
central African nation, formed a committee of experts Monday to set up
a peacekeeping force.
"We have the feeling that Burundi is on the edge of the precipice;
something has to be done fast," said Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase
Gasana.
Rwanda, which has the same ethnic mix as its neighbour Burundi,
suffered through a vicious civil war in 1994 in which Hutu extremists
slaughtered more than 500,000 men, women and children before being
defeated by a rebel army of the minority Tutsis.
The expert panel is headed by the commander of the Tanzanian army and
has representatives from Burundi itself, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia,
with Kenya as an observer.
Burundi's Hutu president and Tutsi prime minister appealed for military
assistance at a regional summit here on June 25, saying they were
unable to contain the fighting.
It began in 1993 when Tutsi troops assassinated Melchior Ndadaye,
Burundi's first Hutu president, in a coup attempt.
Tens of thousands of Burundians have been killed since. The countryside
is unsafe as the Tutsi-dominated army battles Hutu rebels, but most
casualties are villagers.
The two leaders' appeal created a firestorm back home, with some
members of the Tutsi-dominated UPRONA (Unity for National Progress)
party accusing them of high treason.
They both then distanced themselves from the appeal, saying the force
would be under Burundian command, and that its mandate would be drawn
up by Burundian officials.
The expert panel was meeting here Tuesday and will travel soon to the
Burundian capital, Bujumbura.
The host of the technical commission meeting, Tanzanian Foreign
Minister Jakaya Kikwete, said the peacekeeping force would not be
looking for a fight but would nonetheless mean business, and delegation
members insisted it would be independent, with its own command.
"We don't want the troops to go to Burundi and fight anybody," Kikwete
said. "We would like the troops to go there and keep peace but with the
capability to deal with those who are going to break the peace."
The meeting took place despite a request from the Burundi delegation
for a delay because preliminary studies had not been completed in
Bujumbura. These are supposed to be delivered by Wednesday to Burundi's
national security council, its top security authority.
Implementation of the operation could begin after the Organisation of
African Unity, meeting at a summit in Cameroon on Monday, and the
United Nations had given their blessing to it, Kikwete said.
The regional peacekeeping force would allow a national dialogue in
Burundi to take place in a calm atmosphere, he stressed.
UN special rapporteur on human rights Paulo Sergio Pinheiro of Brazil
was meanwhile due to arrive in Bujumbura on Tuesday for a two-week
visit, officials said in Geneva.
He earned the wrath of the government there by describing the situation
in an earlier report as "genocide by attrition."
Two US envoys are also in Bujumbura for secret talks with the
government -- special representative for Burundi peace negotiations
Howard Wolpe, and special coordinator for Rwanda and Burundi Richard
Bogosian.
