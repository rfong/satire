Race/NNP for/IN Leadership/NNP Remains/NNS Deadlocked/NNP Former/NNP Italian/JJ Trade/NNP Minister/NNP Renato/NNP Ruggiero/NNP is/VBZ the/DT clear/JJ leader/NN in/IN the/DT three-way/JJ race/NN to/TO head/VB the/DT fledgling/JJ World/NNP Trade/NNP Organization/NNP ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT first/JJ official/JJ figures/NNS published/VBN Wednesday/NNP ./.

The/DT WTO/NN said/VBD Ruggiero/NNP out/RB of/IN replies/NNS from/IN 116/CD delegations/CD ,/, Ruggiero/NNP had/VBD support/NN from/IN 57/CD countries/NNS ./.

Former/NNP South/NNP Korean/NNP Trade/NNP Minister/NNP Kim/NNP Chulsu/NNP trailed/VBD with/IN 29/CD ,/, with/IN former/JJ Mexican/NNP President/NNP Carlos/NNP Salinas/NNP de/IN Gortari/NNP on/IN 28/CD ./.

Two/CD delegations/NNS did/VBD not/RB list/VB a/DT preference/NN ./.

Under/IN WTO/NN rules/NNS ,/, any/DT choice/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB made/VBN by/IN consensus/NN rather/RB than/IN by/IN a/DT vote/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN Ruggiero/NNP can/MD only/RB become/VB director-general/NN if/IN no/DT one/NN opposes/VBZ him/PRP ./.

The/DT United/NNP States/NNP and/CC Latin/NNP American/NNP countries/NNS are/VBP firmly/RB behind/IN Salinas/NNP ./.

Japan/NNP and/CC other/JJ Asian/JJ nations/NNS are/VBP pushing/VBG Kim/NNP ,/, while/IN Europe/NNP and/CC former/JJ colonies/NNS in/IN Africa/NNP and/CC the/DT Caribbean/NNP want/VBP Ruggiero/NNP ./.

Ruggiero/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT clear/JJ favorite/NN for/IN months/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP no/DT signs/NNS of/IN a/DT solution/NN to/TO the/DT regional/JJ deadlock/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB unacceptable/JJ to/TO the/DT Europeans/NNPS ./.

An/DT increasingly/RB likely/JJ scenario/NN is/VBZ that/IN Peter/NNP Sutherland/NNP ,/, who/WP headed/VBD the/DT General/NNP Agreement/NNP on/IN Tariffs/NNP and/CC Trade/NNP and/CC is/VBZ now/RB caretaker/NN head/NN of/IN the/DT successor/NN WTO/NN ,/, will/MD agree/VB to/TO stay/VB on/RP beyond/IN his/PRP$ March/NNP 15/CD term/NN ./.
