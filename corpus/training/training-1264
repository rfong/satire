Soybeans Gain; Grains Retreat On Wet Weather 
Grain futures prices fell to a second day of profit-taking Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans futures ended higher.
Corn futures led the losses amid trader expectations that rain expected
to last through Wednesday would help improve crop conditions over the
next few weeks. Newly planted crops in the Midwest had been baking
under hot, dry conditions for about two weeks before the weekend
brought milder weather.
Wheat futures showed initial strength on ideas the rain is likely to
cause further deterioration in the winter wheat crop in the Plains and
Midwest, said analyst Dale Gustafson at Smith Barney Inc.
But traders saw continued weakness in the market as an opportunity to
take profits after prices surged to three-year highs, Gustafson said.
``The next two days we expect to be the same with thunderstorms across
Illinois and pretty good growing conditions,'' he said ``That gave the
traders the opportunity for some evening-up and to take a breather.''
Soybeans futures prices gained amid strength in the soybean meal
contract, Gustafson said.
Wheat for July delivery fell 4 1-2 cents to dlrs 4.19 a bushel; July
corn fell 3 3-4 cents to dlrs 2.63 1-2 a bushel; July oats fell 1-4
cent to dlrs 1.40 a bushel; July soybeans rose 3 3-4 cents to dlrs 5.83
3-4 a bushel.
