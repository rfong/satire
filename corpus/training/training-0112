Peace, he said, "is a very real possibility."
"We did not occupy the Golan for historic reasons but because the
plateau is a strategic stake. The time has come to use it as a trade to
obtain a true peace which guarantees Israel's security," he added.
This round of discussions follows a six-month break, after an impasse
over the question of an eventual Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to make a return
trip to the Middle East on January 10, after the next round of
negotiations concludes.
The State Department spokesman refused to give any details about the
informal discussions expected to last through the weekend, and no
comment was immediately available from either the Syrian or Israeli
embassy.
"Both sides considered the talks useful and conducive to further
discussion," he said.
"In light of this, the US has proposed and both delegations have agreed
to remain in the Washington area to continue the consultations and
preparation for the resumption of talks" next Wednesday, he said.
It was not immediately clear whether all or just some of the
negotiators would remain here.
