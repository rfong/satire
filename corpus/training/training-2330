Jordan's 1998 Deficit Down by 34 Percent 
Jordan's parliament Monday approved the country's 1998 draft state
budget which predicts a deficit of 37 million Jordanian dinars (about
52 million U.S. dollars), a 34 percent decrease over that of last year.
Altogether 59 out of 74 deputies present voted for the budget that
envisages total revenues at 1.95 billion dinars (about 2.75 billion
dollars), a 5 percent increase over that of last year.
The expenditures are estimated at 1.987 billion dinars (about 2.806
billion dollars), a 4 percent increase over that of 1997.
The budget plan increases spending on education, health services,
social security, tourism, youth and infrastructure.
In the budget for fiscal year 1997, Jordan's revenues stood at 1.86
billion dinars (2.6 billion dollars), expenditures at 1.916 billion
dinars (2.7 billion dollars) and deficit at 56 million dinars (78
million dollars).
While delivering a speech at the parliament, Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali confirmed that the country's foreign debts stand at 6.7 billion
dinars (9.5 billion dollars) compared with 5.6 billion dinars (8.3
billion dollars) in 1989.
Meanwhile, during the four-day debate of the budget at the Lower House,
deputies blamed the government for the ever larger population under the
poverty line, the increase of unemployment and the unsuccessful
economic reforms and they asked the government to spare no efforts in
solving the issues this year.
Poverty rate is now estimated at 30 percent and unemployment rate
ranges from 15 percent at the official level to 27 percent as
calculated by independent institutions.
Deputies also claimed that Jordan's commitment to the current economic
reform structured by the International Monetary Fund has aggravated the
problems of social poverty and unemployment.
