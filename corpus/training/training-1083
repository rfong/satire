Philippine Banks Are Y2K Ready: Official 
The Philippine government Tuesday reassured the public that there is no
need to withdraw too much money from banks since Philippine banks are
Y2K ready and their deposits will remain safe.
In a radio interview here, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre
said the Central Bank of the Philippines has assured his office that
the banking sector has made adequate preparations for the Y2K problem.
"Just see to it that you will have your normal cash transactions. But
any excess cash should be left behind in the bank because that is the
safest place to place our money," Aguirre said.
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems
preventing them from correctly recognizing dates from January 1, 2000
onward.
Aguirre, who also heads the national contingency task force on Y2K,
said the central bank supervised the contingency planning and
rechecking, as well as the updating of the compliance, by various banks
on their Y2K readiness plans.
Banks in strategic areas will remain open during the holidays from
December 31, Friday, to January 2, Sunday, to make sure banking
services run smoothly, he said.
