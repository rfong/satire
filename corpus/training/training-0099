Rally for the Republic set to elect Juppe party leader 
A gathering on meeting on Sunday of France's most powerful political
party, the Neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR), is poised to
elect troubled French Prime Minister Alain Juppe as it party president,
party officials said.
The election of Juppe, 50, who has held the post of party president on
an interim basis since his predecessor Jacques Chirac quit in November
1994 to run for office as president of France, is considered a
formality.
RPR members hope his confirmation as party head will give the
beleagured prime minister new momemtum.
After five months in office, Juppe has been battered by a series of
scandals, including his use of his position as a city official in Paris
to secure luxury apartments for his family members at below market
rents. Juppe's ratings in opinion polls are the worst ever for a French
prime minster.
The RPR meeting, to be attended by 20,000 party activists, will be held
at Marne-la-Vallee, outside of Paris.
Meanwhile, Lionel Jospin, defeated as the Socialist presidential
candidate earlier this year, was elected Socialist party leader
Saturday and immediately called on Socialists to rally to win back
power from the RPR.
Buoyed by an overwhelming 94 percent backing from his party, Jospin
told a crowd of around 2,000 Socialists at the party's national
convention that the time was ripe to "reconquer" a government that "is
collapsing in on itself and suffering an unprecedented crisis of
confidence."
