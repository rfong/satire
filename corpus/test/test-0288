Nasdaq, German banks to create Neuer Markt rival: report 
Nasdaq, the US electronic stock market, will join forces with three
major German banks to create a rival to Deutsche Boerse's Neuer Markt,
according to a German newspaper report Tuesday.
The weekly newspaper Wirtschaftswoche, in its Wednesday edition, said
the agreement would extend Nasdaq's relationship with regional stock
exchange manager Berliner Boerse and would bring in Commerzbank,
Dresdner Bank and HypoVereinsbank as partners.
The newspaper did not cite its sources.
The new platform, to be called Nasdaq Germany, would initially allow
trade of the most important Nasdaq stocks, it said.
Then, as a second step, it would be opened up to new technology shares,
bringing it into direct competition with the Frankfurt electronic
exchange the Neuer Markt, which has lost 20 percent of its value since
the start of the year.
The move would also bring the banks involved in direct conflict with
Deutsche Bank electronic stock market, and the Berliner Boerse
announced a strategic partnership last year and indicated they needed
further "strong partners".
All the institutions declined to comment.
