Hollywood Big Noses gather to celebrate at Annual Event
A glittering array of stars turned out last night for the 42nd annual
Nosey's. Celebrating the best and the brightest big nosed stars, the
event attracted such luminaries as Barry Manilow, Barbara
Streisand,Dustin Hoffman, and Pete Townsend of The Who, who arrived
with someone else's children. Oh,and Ashley Simpson was there too. But
she was ignored by most sane individuals.
"I'm delighted to be here", said nominee Sean Penn, "I rowed here in a
bathtub after another of my homes burned down but this whole occasion
has cheered me up. I owe my career to my big nose".
Tennis ace, Steffi Graf spoke briefly: "A few years ago I won Best
Supporting Female Nose but this year I'm just happy to be nominated",
she lied.
Each nominated person receives a gift basket containing tissues and
nose hair clippers, worth almost $5000.
British big nose Rod Stewart was in great mood: "I bumped into Ronnie
Woods (The Rolling Stones) back stage and we shared a hankerchief.
Maybe we'll share some nose-candy later on, too".
A special award was posthumously awarded to legendary performer Jimmy
Durante for "Outstanding Achievemnt in Big Noseness".
