Rebels say kidnapped bishop in good health, soon to be freed 
Rebels who kidnapped a Roman Catholic bishop in Burundi at the weekend
said Monday he was in good health and would soon be freed.
"The bishop of Ruyigi (Joseph Nduhirubusa) is well and will be released
soon," Pierre Nkurunziza, a spokesman for the most active wing of the
Forces for the Defence of Democracy told AFP by telephone.
He "is not a hostage. We are going to free him as soon as we can do so
safely, because there is a war on," the spokesman added.
The bishop was abducted with his driver on Saturday, in an ambush that
left two bodyguards dead.
Also Monday, Bujumbura Bishop Evariste Ngoyagoye went on national radio
to call for his colleague's immediate release, pointing out that
Nkurunziza had recently undergone surgery and that his health was
frail.
Since 1993, a bishop and a score of priests and nuns, including one
from Italy, have been killed in Burundi's civil war, which pits Hutu
rebels against an army dominated by the Tutsi minority.
More than 250,000 people have died in the conflict.
