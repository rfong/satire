S'pore, German Airlines Cooperate in Indonesian Market 
Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Lufthansa have established cooperation to
work in the Indonesian market along with Singapore, Australia and
Germany.
"The cooperation which is based on a 'code-sharing' system is expected
to give value-added benefit for the airline passengers as they will get
special discounts, more convenient transits, smooth luggage handling,
connecting more than 60 cities in Europe," SIA General Manager
Vijendran Alfreds said.
Talking to reporters here Monday, Alfreds said the cooperation enables
passengers from Jakarta to go to Germany or 60 cities in Europe with
only 510 U.S. dollars (return).
They can fly to Europe every day as Lufthansa will fly every Monday,
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, and SIA every Wednesday, Friday and
Sunday.
With the agreement, Lufthansa's passengers from Europe can continue
their trip to Australian cities like Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth
and Adelaide using SIA via Singapore since Lufthansa stopped its
flights to Australia three years ago.
On the other hand, SIA would fly the passengers to 11 cities in Germany
via Hamburg, Dusseldorf, Munich, Stuttgart, Koln, Bonn, Nuremberg,
Leipzig, Bremen, Hannover and Dresden every day with transit in
Frankfurt.
Apart from that, SIA would fly every day to Brussels and Geneva and
four times a week to Vienna.
The two airlines have been operating their cooperation since November
last year after they paved the way for the cooperation in September
1989 when the two airlines started cargo services between Singapore and
Frankfurt.
