But Ferguson will be relieved that Blackburn had to settle for a point
against a Norwich side without a win in 1995, who had conceded seven
goals in their previous two games.
It was the first time this season that Blackburn had failed to score in
the League at Ewood Park where they have only dropped seven points in
16 games this season.
Norwich owed much of their success in containing Rovers to the absence
of suspended striker Chris Sutton and to centre-back John Newsome, who
ensured that Alan Shearer did not add to his 29 goals for the season.
Despite the result Norwich manager John Deehan tipped Rovers to take
the title, saying:
"My money is on them because of strikers Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton.
Also, I think it is difficult for a club to win a hat-trick of titles
like United."
Arsenal, who sacked George Graham in midweek following the Premier
League inquiry into illegal transfer payments, made light of their
problems to cruise to a comfortable 3-0 win against London rivals
Crystal Palace.
Paul Merson put the Gunners ahead before recent signing Chris Kiwomya
grabbed two to seal Arsenal's second consecutive victory under
caretaker manager Stewart Houston.
Third-placed Newcastle cruised to a 3-1 St James' Park win against
Villa, thanks to two goals from Peter Beardsley after Andy Townsend had
cancelled out Barry Venison's opener.
