Pudong Development Changes Residents' Life (2)
Over 3,000 families have moved into Pudong and in the past decade, more
than 30,000 households moved out of Lujiazui and 260, 000 farmers left
their land and took up new jobs.
Zhao Linkun was already 60 when he moved. He started to study gardening
techniques and after two years he became a professional gardener. "In
fast-changing Pudong, I have to keep up with the times, too," he said.
Many other farmers have learnt about computer, finance, machinery, and
catering.
In Jinqiao Zone in Pudong, villagers have set up warehouses for Siemens
and other large enterprises to store products, earning more than 10
million yuan (about 1.2 million U.S. dollars) in profits.
Farmers and others in Pudong have become more aware of life styles in
the West. "It is not unusual to see Shanghai men go to work wearing
western-style suits and ties," said Mr. Wang, a local taxi-driver.
Once considered a "countryside" in the eyes of Shanghainese, Pudong has
become one of the most attractive choice for college students and
returned Chinese students studying abroad.
