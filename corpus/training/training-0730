Defense Department Typo Results In U.S. Attack On Ira
The U.S. Defense Department apologized to Skokie, IL, dentist Ira Nussbaum
Tuesday following a bombing campaign aimed at removing the 37-year-old from
power. "Apparently, the intelligence source who drafted the attack plan
against Iraq failed to strike the 'Q' key hard enough," Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld said. "The 'Q' was always a little stubborn on that
keyboard. Sorry." This marks the first military action taken against
Nussbaum since a malfunctioning shift key prompted Ulster Unionists to
detonate his Ford Taurus in 1998.
