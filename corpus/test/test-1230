To Go Or Not To Go? Not To Go Says PM
Dithering Prime Minister Gordon "Which Way The Wind Blows" Brown has
decided that he will definitely not, cross-his-heart-and-hope-to-die
attend the Beijing It's A Knockout opening ceremony in August.
Instead, It's A Knockout minister Tessa Jowell will play Gordon in the
upcoming Bash-A-Tibetan extravaganza, due to show just how much fun the
Chinese authorities can be.
However, Downing Street says the PM might take part in some of the
games, disguised in a Chinese police uniform and carrying a truncheon,
with which he will playfully thwack Tibetan monks over the head.
"Mr Brown wants to show that he too can be fun," said a Downing Street
spokeswoman. "That's why he's prepared to join the Chinese team against
the Tibbies, as we like to call the Tibetan Monk team. And of course,
being on the Chinese team won't do our economic relationship any harm."
Asked whether she thought the games would be a little one-sided, the
spokeswoman replied, "Not at all. Those Tibbies might look all
sweetness and light, but take away their human rights, and they're up
for a good scrap. Lots of fun guaranteed!"
Downing Street also said that Mr Brown will definitely probably be
attending the closing ceremony unless something happens to change his
mind.
