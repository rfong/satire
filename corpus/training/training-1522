Sino-Israeli Agricultural Cooperation Potential 
China could introduce overseas advanced agricultural technology in an
all-round way in some of its provinces and regions, as a good way to
accelerate the country 's agricultural upgrading.
This is a view shared by Chinese and overseas experts attending the
ongoing International Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable
Processing Technology and Industrialization, which opened on October 12
in the coastal city of Yantai in eastern Shandong Province and will run
through October 16.
Shandong is cited as an ideal choice for agricultural cooperation with
Israel, thanks to their similar climates.
Xuan Zengpei, an official of Chinese Academy of Engineering, said that
the popularization of greenhouses used for growing vegetables in
Shandong has set a good foundation for the province to widely introduce
irrigation technology and fine seeds from Israel to further develop
local agriculture.
Located in an arid area, Israel is renowned for advanced irrigation
technologies, which carry weight in agricultural development in the
country and have helped quadruple its agricultural output on the whole,
said Nathan Shunari, agricultural attache of the Israeli Embassy in
China.
He also attributed Israel's efficient agriculture to high-level
industrialization. Israel's investment in the development of
agricultural technology accounts for 30 percent of the country's GNP.
China is now in great need of fostering farm products processing
companies and furthering agricultural technological improvement, said
Xuan Zengpei, adding that China should increase economic and
technological exchanges as well as cooperation with foreign countries.
