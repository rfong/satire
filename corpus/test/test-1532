Former minister to appear before supreme court over death squads 
A supreme court judge has summoned former interior minister Jose
Barrionuevo and former security minister Rafael Vera to appear next
week in connection with anti-Basque death squads, a judicial official
said.
The two former officials of the previous socialist government of Felipe
Gonzelez will be confronted with former Civil Guard chief Luis Roldan,
who has accused them and the former prime minister of involvement in
the activities of the Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups (GAL).
Roldan told judge Eduardo Moner on May 29 that Barrionuevo had said to
him in 1990 that Gonzalez "knew everything" about the undercover war
against Basque separatists of the ETA movement.
The campaign was a "political action of the government," Barrionuevo
allegedly added.
Roldan, who is facing corruption charges linked to his command of the
paramilitary Civil Guard, accused the former interior minister of
personally ordering the kidnapping in 1983 of a French citizen of
Spanish origin, Segundo Marey.
In previous appearances before Moner Barrionuevo and Vera have denied
any connection with the GAL.
Moner has also summoned former police officer Miguel Dominguez, who is
serving a jail sentence of 108 years for involvement in the activities
of the GAL.
Last week Dominguez said he wanted to tell the whole truth about the
GAL affair.
