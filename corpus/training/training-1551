Armed assailants take hostage nightclub patrons 
Armed men took several people hostage during a holdup early Monday at a
nightclub in Porta Westfalica in northwest Germany, police said.
Apparently seven people, several who had been slightly wounded, were
being held by the assailants at 9:00 a.m. (0700 GMT), police said,
cautioning that they were not sure of this figure.
Police said one of the assailants was arrested but did not give any
further details.
The hostage drama unfolded at about 6:20 a.m. (0420 GMT) after the
assailants burst into the nightclub to rob the place, which police said
was also a brothel.
Police said they had cordoned off the area around the nightclub.
