Fuji Photo, Kodak tying up on digital photo: report 
Japan's Fuji Photo Film Co. and Eastman Kodak Co. of the United States
will tie up on digital photography technologhy, despite their legal
battle over the conventional photo film market, it was reported Sunday.
They have basically agreed to standardise specifications of memory
cards for digital cameras and jointly develop home appliances using
pictures of advanced photo system (APS) cameras, the business daily
Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
Fuji Photo and Kodak, the world's two leading makers of photographic
film and paper, agreed in 1991 to cooperate in developing the APS
formula that uses small-sized 24-millimeter film.
The two firms are locked in fierce rivalry in the world's photo film
and paper market, of which they share a combined 70 percent, but they
are to join hands in the digital camera market for obvious reasons, the
newspaper said.
The new market is forecast to reach 20 million units a year by 2000
from less than one million in 1995 with the number of digital camera
makers swollen to more than 20 from five in early 1975.
Kodak sued Fuji Photo in May last year to the Office of the US Trade
Representative for alleged monopolistic practices in Japan's photo film
and paper market.
The issue has been referred to the World Trade Organisation, the
Geneva-based watch dog on free world trade, with focus on whether the
Japanese market as a whole discriminates against foreign makers.
A memory card for digital cameras and portable information terminals is
a stamp-sized chip recording letters, voices and still pictures. At
present, there are four standards for memory cards, one of them
codenamed SSFDC and promoted by Japan's Toshiba Corp. and Fuji Photo.
