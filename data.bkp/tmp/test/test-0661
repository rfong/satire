IMF/NNP pressuring/VBG Russia/NNP on/IN reforms/NNS without/IN throwing/VBG it/PRP overboard/RB The/DT International/NNP Monetary/NNP Fund/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- IMF/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- has/VBZ decided/VBN to/TO continue/VB pressuring/VBG the/DT Russian/JJ government/NN for/IN firm/NN commitments/NNS to/TO reform/NN ,/, and/CC IMF/NNP envoys/NNS were/VBD to/TO leave/VB Moscow/NNP on/IN Tuesday/NNP without/IN having/VBG approved/VBN a/DT crucial/JJ loan/NN of/IN 6.4/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS ,/, already/RB in/IN the/DT 1995/CD Russian/JJ budget/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT international/JJ monetary/JJ agency/NN will/MD undoubtedly/RB avoid/VB throwing/VBG Russia/NNP overboard/RB by/IN a/DT categorical/JJ refusal/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD compromise/VB the/DT continuation/NN of/IN three/CD years/NNS of/IN reforms/NNS and/CC the/DT process/NN of/IN anchoring/VBG the/DT country/NN firmly/RB in/IN the/DT international/JJ community/NN ./.

The/DT IMF/NNP delegation/NN arrived/VBD in/IN the/DT Russian/JJ capital/NN on/IN January/NNP 18/CD and/CC finished/VBD its/PRP$ assignment/NN on/IN Monday/NNP ,/, after/IN almost/RB three/CD weeks/NNS of/IN negotiations/NNS ,/, with/IN a/DT final/JJ meeting/NN with/IN the/DT Russian/JJ government/NN aimed/VBN at/IN drawing/VBG up/RP a/DT list/NN of/IN points/NNS of/IN agreement/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT numerous/JJ issues/NNS still/RB pending/VBG ./.

There/EX are/VBP even/RB more/JJR reasons/NNS now/RB than/IN last/JJ year/NN for/IN refusing/VBG unconditional/JJ international/JJ loans/NNS ,/, including/VBG inflationary/JJ slippage/NN in/IN January/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- 17.8/CD percent/NN inflation/NN for/IN the/DT month/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, tension/NN on/IN the/DT ruble/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT war/NN in/IN Chechnya/NNP ,/, which/WDT endangers/VBZ budget/NN austerity/NN objectives/NNS ./.

Many/JJ months/NNS of/IN discussions/NNS were/VBD needed/VBN to/TO obtain/VB release/NN in/IN March/NNP of/IN an/DT IMF/NNP loan/NN of/IN 1.5/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS to/TO Russia/NNP ./.

``/`` Very/NNP many/JJ difficulties/NNS remain/VBP ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT IMF/NNP 's/POS interest/NN to/TO delay/VB agreement/NN to/TO pressure/VB the/DT Russian/JJ government/NN and/CC parliament/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO obtain/VB as/IN many/JJ commitments/NNS to/TO reform/VB as/RB possible/JJ ''/'' ,/, said/VBD one/CD western/JJ financier/NN on/IN Monday/NNP ./.

Even/RB before/IN release/NN of/IN the/DT official/NN communique/VBP ,/, Russian/JJ finance/NN minister/NN Vladimir/NNP Panskov/NNP said/VBD that/IN this/DT year/NN Russia/NNP would/MD receive/VB less/JJR than/IN the/DT 13/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS in/IN international/JJ credits/NNS already/RB included/VBN in/IN budget/NN receipts/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- out/RB of/IN total/JJ planned/VBN receipts/NNS of/IN 42/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

The/DT minister/NN said/VBD in/IN a/DT television/NN interview/NN that/IN ``/`` We/PRP will/MD not/RB receive/VB the/DT stand-by/JJ credit/NN of/IN six/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS from/IN the/DT IMF/NNP ,/, and/CC we/PRP might/MD not/RB obtain/VB a/DT credit/NN of/IN 600/CD million/CD dollars/NNS for/IN rehabilitation/NN ./.

So/CC many/JJ experts/NNS think/VBP it/PRP unlikely/JJ that/IN the/DT IMF/NNP 's/POS refusal/NN is/VBZ final/JJ ,/, and/CC Panskov/NNP 's/POS defeatist/NN remarks/NNS may/MD be/VB aimed/VBN at/IN ``/`` scaring/VBG some/DT hesitant/JJ members/NNS of/IN parliament/NN ''/'' ,/, they/PRP say/VBP ./.
