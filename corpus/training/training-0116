Argentina sees lowest inflation in 40 years 
Argentina's inflation rate for 1994 will be between 3.6 and 3.7
percent, the lowest in at least 40 years, offficials said Sunday.
The last time inflation was this low was 1954, when consumer prices
rose 3.8 percent.
But Juan Llach, secretary of economic planning for President Carlos
Menem, said austerity measures will likely continue into 1995 as the
government seeks to pay down its public debt by one billion dollars.
Llach said there may be some "fiscal adjustments" as part of the
economic stabilization program but maintained that no tax increases
were planned for the coming year.
