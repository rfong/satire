Serbs will talk with IFOR: Serb official 
Bosnian Serbs will continue talking to NATO commanders, a senior
political figure told Serb radio Friday in an apparent rebuff to
hardline military chiefs who have cut links with the alliance.
"We will continue talks with Bildt's office and with IFOR (NATO's peace
Implementation Force)," Bosnian Serb prime minister Rajko Kasagic said
on Serb Pale radio.
Carl Bildt is the international chief responsible for civilian affairs
relating to Bosnia's complex peace plan.
On Thursday, Bosnian Serb military chief General Ratko Mladic ordered
his officers to break off all relations with the NATO-led force in
protest at the arrests of eight Serb soldiers by the Bosnian government
police. Two of the men are on the International War Crimes Tribunal's
list of suspected war criminals.
Kasagic however, said talks with the Moslem-Croat federation "cannot
continue further ... until our officers and detainees are freed."
In what he described as an "ominous" sign, Lt General Sir Michael
Walker, the commander of NATO ground forces in Bosnia, said Friday that
there had been no high level contacts with the Bosnian Serbs.
NATO officials said late Friday they were unaware of Kasagic's remarks.
However, IFOR spokesman Major Peter Bullock commented if the report was
accurate: "that is good news."
