Attack on Burundi Hospital Kills One: Doctors 
Unknown gunmen attacked Makamba, a town in southern Burundi today,
killing at least one people and ransacking a hospital, the relief
organization Doctors without Borders (MSF) said.
A doctor was killed and all medical staff fled in the attack, and the
hospital's pharmacy was pillaged and ambulances set on fire, a report
reaching here quoted the charity organization as saying.
MSF said it was unclear how many people were killed and wounded. It
disclosed that its medical team had left the town but would like to
return as soon as possible.
It claimed that similar attacks on Karuzi, a region north of Makamba,
had compelled 12,000 people to escape to nearby refugee camps.
It hinted that the raids were made by Hutu rebels and urged them to
spare civilians and respect the neutrality of medical aid workers.
Aid workers accused Hutu rebels of killing at least 100 civilians in
recent attacks in southwestern Burundi. Survivors in the small central
African state complained that hundreds of civilians may have been
slaughtered, including women and children.
Over 100,000 people have been killed in the small central African
country since October 1993, when Tutsi troops assassinated Melchior
Ndadaye, Burundi's first freely-elected Hutu president.
