China Follows Closely on Lee Teng-hui's Visit to US: Spokesman 
A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said here today that China
is following closely on the further developments on Lee Teng-hui's
visit to the United States.
Asked at a press conference what further reaction China will have on
Lee's arrival in the United States, Spokesman Shen Guofang said that
China "has already made its positions more than clear on the U.S.
government permission of Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in
great jeopardy of the basis of Sino-US relations."
He noted that "we want to express our utmost dissatisfaction on the US
government's obstinately clinging to its wrongful position."
"We are closely following the developments of the matter," the
spokesman said.
