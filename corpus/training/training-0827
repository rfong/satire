Sales of British newspapers up following price slashing 
Sales of quality newspapers rose in June, as The Daily Telegraph again
crossed the one million mark, and the Times registered record figures,
according to figures published Saturday amid a cut-throat price war.
The Telegraph's average daily sale for the month of June was 1,006,981,
according to circulation figures for the month of June published in the
paper.
And they placed the Times (which in May registered record sales of
517,575 copies) on 524,270.
Saturday's Independent reported that audited figures show the
Independent sold an average 277,377 copies each day and the Independent
on Sunday 333,484, increases on May of 717 and 8,773 respectively.
In June, the Telegraph dropped its week-day cover price from 48 pence
to 30 pence to match that of its chief rival the Times, after sales
figures for the Telegraph sank below the symbolic one million mark in
April and May.
The Times immediately retaliated by cutting its cover price a further
10 pence to sell for 20 pence.
For one day only in June, the Independent cut its price to 20 pence
instead of its usual 50 pence, while the Guardian (404,225 average
daily sale in June) and the Financial Times (about 300,000 copies) have
maintained throughout their existing cover prices of 45 pence and 65
pence respectively.
The Times, Independent and Telegraph are all located on the right or
centre-right of the political spectrum, but even the Guardian on the
centre-left, has seen its sales fall since the price cut begun by the
Times last year.
Of the British broadsheet dailies, only the Financial Times, which
sells to a distinctive business market, is likely to remain unaffected
by the price war.
