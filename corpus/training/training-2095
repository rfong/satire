Strong quake jolts eastern Indonesia, no casualties reported 
A strong earthquake measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale Monday jolted
the eastern Indonesian islands in the Banda Sea but initial reports
spoke of only limited damage, the meteorology and geophysics office
here said.
The earthquake that struck at 0443 GMT was centred in the Banda Sea,
169 kilometers (104.8 miles) under the sea bed and some 230 kilometres
(142.6 miles) west of the town of Saumlaki on Tanimbar island, said
Dadi Kuntadi of the office.
The centre was some 40 kilometres (25 miles) southeast of the small
island of Damar but there was no report from the island as it has no
direct telephone or radio links.
The walls of the house of the police chief in Saumlaki and a shopping
centre in the same town were reported to have cracked but there was no
reports of casualties, Kuntadi said.
He said the quake was felt strongest in Saumlaki, at between V and VI
on the Mercalli scale, a scale which goes from I to XII measuring the
intensity of the temblor felt at a particular area.
It was also felt in Ambon, in the central Moluccas, Tual in southeast
Moluccas, at up to IV on the Mercalli scale while in Sorong and Nabire,
in Irian Jaya the quake was felt at an intensity of II to III on the
same scale.
An earthquake measuring six on the Richter scale can cause severe
damage in populated areas.
