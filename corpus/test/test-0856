Vatican to ratify UN anti-torture treaty 
The Vatican said Wednesday that it plans to ratify the United Nations'
anti-torture treaty, timing the announcement to coincide with the world
body's International Day in Support of Torture Victims.
The Vatican will become the 130th state to adopt the 1984 Convention
Against Torture once the instruments ratifying the document are
delivered to Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York by the Holy See's
UN observer.
He is also to carry a message from Pope John Paul II saying "the Holy
See plans to bring moral support and its cooperation to the
international community in it search to eliminate the inhumane and
inadmissable resort of torture."
Although the Vatican has in centuries past condoned torture -- notably
during the Spanish Inquisition, when the practice was a common means of
forcing conversions -- contemporary popes have all denounced the
practice.
In 1965 the Holy See condemned "all that constitutes the violation of a
human being's integrity, such as mutiliation, physical or moral
torture, or psychological constraints."
