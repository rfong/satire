Israeli Warplanes Attack Palestinian Police Headquarters
Israeli fighter planes attacked Palestinian police headquarters in downtown
Gaza early Sunday morning. No injuries were reported so far.
The fighters also attacked other Palestinian posts in the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank, in retaliation for the deaths of three Israeli
soldiers and two civilians and the wounding of 10 others on Saturday,
Israeli military officials said.
The planes "successfully" hit the civilian police headquarters in Gaza
City, military intelligence and police headquarters in Deir al-Balah,
south of Gaza, a statement released by the Israeli military said.
Palestinian security officials termed the air strikes "a very grave
aggression," which they said would lead to a very dangerous situation
in the area.
