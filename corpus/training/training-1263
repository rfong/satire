Taiwan criticizes Chinese moves to block officials from Hong Kong 
Taiwan on Monday criticized recent Chinese moves to pressure Hong Kong
over the issuing of visas to Taiwanese officials for visits to the
British colony.
Such acts "will do nothing to promote exchanges between Taiwan and Hong
Kong," said the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), Taiwan's
top mainland policy planning body.
It said the Chinese moves will also affect economic and trade
activities between Taiwan and Hong Kong.
The council was referring to the failure of its vice chairwoman Yeh
Chin-feng and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Overseas Chinese affairs
department director Wang Neng-chang to obtain visas from Hong Kong.
MAC officials said visa applications by the two and many other senior
government and KMT officials have been rejected by the Hong Kong
government under Chinese pressure.
Hong Kong news media has also reported that the immigration authorities
in the colony have been asked by China to tighten their issuance of
visas to senior Taiwan officials, including those from the cabinet,
MAC, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the director and
deputy director of various KMT departments.
Currently, there are more than 200 direct flights per week between
Taiwan and Hong Kong.
China, which has viewed Taiwan as a rebel province since the end of a
civil war in 1949, has warned other countries against allowing visits
by senior Taiwanese officials.
Beijing has claimed the trips are moves by Taiwan to try to increase
its international profile and to justify its status as a member of
international society instead of a local government.
