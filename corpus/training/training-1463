Pedersen Expects Long Term in Blackburn 
Norwegian international defender Tore Pedersen said on Wednesday he
expected to sign a long term contract with Blackburn if he can finally
earn a regular first team place.
According to local reports Wedndesday, the 28-year-old said:"If Colin
Hendry had stayed I was expecting to leave the club, but now I can see
an opportunity to play every week.
"If I could get a first team place I would be happy to stay here,
extend my contract and stay for the rest of my career.
"I had hopes of playing in the World Cup for Norway but it is right
that if you are not playing first team football you should not be in
the national team."
Pederson, who has 46 Norwegian caps, came to Blackburn from Germany's
St Pauli for 500,000 pounds (808,500 U.S. dollars) last September but
has played in only three premier league matches.
Blackburn sold fellow central defender Hendry to Rangers of Scotland
earlier this month, opening the way for Pederson to stake a claim.
