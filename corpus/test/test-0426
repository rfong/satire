Israeli troops kill Palestinian child in Jenin camp 
Israeli troops shot dead a six-year-old Palestinian boy Wednesday as
they opened fire on stone-throwers in Jenin refugee camp in the
northern West Bank, medical sources said.
Bassam Saadi was hit in the chest when Israeli troops opened fire with
a machine-gun mounted on a tank at a group of children, also wounding a
12-year-old boy, a Jenin hospital official told AFP.
The children were throwing stones at Israeli tanks, the sources said.
Israeli troops reoccupied Jenin camp and the town of the same name last
week and have imposed a curfew, as part of a new West Bank offensive in
retaliation for anti-Israeli attacks by Palestinian militants.
