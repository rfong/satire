Chicago Trades McDowell to Yankees 
Jack McDowell, one of baseball's best pitchers and soon to become a
free agent, was traded by the Chicago White Sox to the New York Yankees
for a minor league pitcher and a player to be named.
The 28-year-old right-hander, the 1993 AL Cy Young Award winner, was
10-9 last season with a 3.73 ERA. He was among the AL leaders in
innings, strikeouts, complete games and shutouts.
``He's a top pitcher, a Cy Young winner once, who threw great last
year,'' New York general manager Gene Michael said Wednesday. ``He's a
great competitor, a proven winner.''
The White Sox received Keith Heberling, a promising 22-year-old pitcher
who ended last season in the Eastern League.
McDowell would become a restricted free agent if owners impose a salary
cap on Thursday, as is expected. He could sign an offer sheet with any
team but the Yankees would have 10 days to match any offer. Jim Abbott
of the Yankees is in a similar situation.
McDowell went to arbitration the last three years with the White Sox,
winning in 1993 and losing in 1992 and 1994. He was soured by the
experience and vowed last spring not to play with the White Sox in
1995.
``He was the leader of our staff,'' White Sox manager Gene Lamont told
Chicago radio station WMVP. ``I don't think anybody things he's going
to be easy to replace. He's as good a pitcher as there is in baseball.
We just didn't think we could re-sign him.''
Michael said he is confident of signing McDowell, who made dlrs 5.3
million last season, the highest one-year deal ever for a pitcher.
``We think we could do it correctly and come out with a player like
this,'' Michael said from Chicago, where owners and general managers
will meet Thursday. ``We like him for our staff if we can get him in
here. We have to make a qualifying offer first, which is 110 percent of
his contract.
In '93, McDowell won the Cy Young when he finished 22-10 with a 3.37
ERA. He is 91-58 lifetime with a 3.50 ERA, 49 complete games and 10
shutouts in 191 games, all with the White Sox.
McDowell had a rough start to the 1994 season, with his record at 2-7
and his ERA at 7.54 as of May 13. But over his last 10 starts, McDowell
went 7-2 with a 1.81 ERA, allowing just 17 earned runs over 84 2-3
innings. He threw three consecutive complete games to finish the
season.
McDowell would join a Yankees starting rotation featuring left-hander
Jimmy Key, who finished second in voting for the Cy Young,
right-handers Melido Perez and Scott Kamieniecki and young left-hander
Sterling Hitchcock.
