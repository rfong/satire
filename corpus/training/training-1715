First Trading Day of HKSAR Stock Market 
The Hong Kong stock market staged an active performance on the first
trading day after the establishment of Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region on July 1.
This morning, some brokers on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange put national
flags on their desks, marking the start of the new era in Hong kong.
After a five-day holiday, trading began at 10:00 AM with the Hang Seng
Index, the key indicator of blue chips, setting a record of 15,345.
Soon after, it climbed to the daily high of 15,363 points. The
financial sector performed well, climbing to 18,779, a rise of 445
points over the previous trading day.
However, trading fluctuated later because of investors' worries about a
change of the government policy on properties and closed at 15,055,
down 141 points from the previous session.
The total trade volume was 24.5 billion HK dollars, close to the record
of 26.5 billion HK dollars set on June 20.
Security experts described the drop as a normal adjustment. Hong Kong's
return to China will boost the stock market in the near future and the
Hang Seng Index is bound to set new record.
The Futures Exchange Ltd. also made a good beginning, with the daily
trade volume totaling 20,149, 42 percent higher than that of the
previous trading day.
Frank Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, said Hong
Kong's economy will become closer with that of China since it has
returned to the motherland.
"To our exchange, the reunification brings new opportunities as well as
new challenges," he said.
