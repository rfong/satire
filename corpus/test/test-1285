Big Brother: New Racism Allegations
There was more controversy at the Big Brother house today, with new
racism allegations flying about as Mohamed and Kathreya became the
latest non-white housemates to be evicted.
Kathreya, from Thailand, and Mohamed, from Somalia, were evicted last
night after the public vote, and race equality groups immediately swung
into action.
Mohamed had been hotly tipped to win the first prize, and, like
Democratic party US Presidential candidate Barack Obama, to be the
first black man to win the race for the House.
No non-white housemates remain in the House.
Last night Mohamed was said to be "hungry".
The eviction of Kathreya, meanwhile, has caused uproar in her native
Thailand. Thousands of people took to the streets of the capital,
Bangkok, protesting at the "disgraceful way" the three-foot
bespectacled beach ball was unceremoniously chucked-out of the House in
her dressing gown and slippers, and without make-up.
Last night, a State of Emergency was announced by the Thai government.
Honestly, what a load of old rubbish.
