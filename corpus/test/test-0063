Abiola trial adjourned 
The treason trial here of Nigerian opposition leader Moshood Abiola,
who has declared himself elected head of state, was adjourned Tuesday
for one day after a challenge from the defence, court sources said.
The lawyer for Abiola, whose campaign against military rule is being
backed by pro-democracy activists and petroleum industry workers in the
fifth week of a strike, challenged the jurisdiction of the court to
hear the case.
The adjournment would enable the prosecution to respond to the
challenge that the federal high court, created specially here to try
Abiola, lacked the competence because his offence was allegedly
committed in Lagos.
Abiola was arrested days after he made a public appearance to declare
himself president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces on June
11, the eve of the first anniversary of elections he is believed to
have won, before the junta annulled the outcome of the poll.
