Communist protesters greet Hillary Clinton in Nepal 
Angry leftist demonstrators chanted ani-US slogans hurled black flags
at US First Lady Hillary Clinton Friday as she arrived for a three-day
visit to Nepal.
Police said 19 of the demonstrators, many of whom waved banners saying
"Imperialist Yankees go home," were arrested at the airport after a
group tossed a bundle of the black flags at the US first lady in a sign
of protest.
The flags scattered around the wife of President Bill Clinton and their
daughter Chelsea, but neither was hurt.
The protestors were from the the communist United People's Front (UPF).
Another communist group, the United Communist Party of Nepal, took
power in the country in legislative elections last November. Clinton
was due to meet the communist leader, Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikari
later Friday.
The route taken by Clinton's bullet-proof limousine, specially flown in
from the United States, was lined with further groups of angry
demonstrators.
UPF official Tulsi Humagai said 19 party members who were arrested had
only been waving black flags and shouting slogans and that nothing was
thrown.
Those arrested included the leader of the All Nepal Women Revolutionary
Organization, Hisila Yemi, and the secretary general of the All Nepal
Trade Union Federation, Kumar Dahal, Humagi said.
Before the incident, Clinton and her daughter Chelsea were taken to the
"Very Very Important Persons" (VVIP) lounge at Tribhuvan International
Airport by Queen Aishworya and Princess Shruti at the start of the
third leg of their four-nation south Asian tour.
She was given a lively welcome by Nepalese girls in traditional
costume, and greeted by acting deputy premier Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli,
cabinet members, heads of foreign missions in Nepal and senior
officials.
The US First Lady was to be received later Friday by King Birendra and
Queen Aishwarya at the Narayanhity royal palace.
She was later to discuss the government's wildlife conservation
programme with Adhikari, a source close to the premier said.
Clinton was to visit Kalimati Clinic in Kathmandu, attend a women's
craft event and meet prominent Nepalese women at a tea hosted by US
Ambassador Sandra Louise Vogelgesang.
On Saturday, Clinton is to visit the Royal Chitaun National Park, 110
kilometres (68 miles) south of Kathmandu and spend the night at the
Tiger Tops Jungle Lodge in the park.
The last major US political figure to make an official visit to Nepal
was then vice president Spiro Agnew in the early 1970s.
Clinton -- who has already visited Pakistan and India -- will fly back
to Kathmandu on Sunday and leave for Bangladesh the same day.
