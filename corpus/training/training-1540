Nigeria To Send More Troops To Sierra Leone 
Nigeria announced Wednesday it would send more troops to Sierra Leone
to lend further support to its military leader.
Maj. Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar said that escalating rebel activity and
the need to protect Nigerian military equipment was behind the move. He
did not say how many troops would be sent to the West African country.
Abubakar noted that Nigeria was the fourth-ranking contributor of
troops to peacekeeping missions around the world. Nigeria has more than
2,000 soldiers in Sierra Leone, where a civil war has simmered for four
years.
Rebels with the Revolutionary United Front recently drew closer to the
capital, Freetown, and they have abducted and released several
foreigners.
Guinean and Nigerian troops assist Sierra Leone under a three-party
agreement and the ruling National Provisional Ruling Council recently
increased the army to about 13,000 troops. But it has been unable to
defeat the rebels who want a civilian government installed.
Sierra Leone's civil war has claimed 5,000 lives according to
international estimates and 15,000 according to the rebel Revolutionary
United Front.
