Australian Dollar Ends Lower 
The Australian dollar continued to falter today under the pressure of
speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) still has a bias
toward lowering official interest rates.
The local currency closed at 74.8 U.S. cents from 75.14.
"The Australian dollar has weakened on the back of actual and expected
movements in interest rate differentials, reaching a 10-month low on
the trade weighted index of 56.6," said Citibank economist Annette
Beacher.
The gap between interest rates here and in the United States closed on
May 23 when the RBA lowered rates to 5.5 percent.
The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its overnight indicator rate on
March 25 and may do so again when its policy-making committee meets on
July 1 to 2.
This would make U.S. securities more attractive to global investors
than Australian securities because of the higher U.S. interest rates on
offer.
Beacher said the Australian currency remains supported in the long
term, forecasting that it will be nearer to 79 U.S. cents than 73 by
Christmas.
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar closed lower.
The local unit was at 84.81 Japanese yen, down from 85.31 previously
and at 1.2957 Deutsche marks from 1.2967.
