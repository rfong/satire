Beijing Issues Regulation on Pre-schooler's Education 
Beijing recently issued the country's first pre-school education
regulation, which will go into effect on September 1.
According to Tao Xiping, a local legislator, the code, for the first
time, lowers the starting age for pre-school education from 3 years of
age to newly born infants, which is described as "a big breakthrough"
in China's education system.
Parents in China used to let their children receive systematic
education from the age of three, but the new regulation advocates
earlier education.
However, it is compulsory and does not force parents to send their
infants to pre-school.
