Ellen Degenerates & Ana Ward to Adopt baby Danielynn Smith
I just wish all this media frenzy would stop over ANS and the baby, IT
SHOULD ALL BE OVER NOW. I am now putting a stop to it and updating the
world on the latest and hopefully the story will remain buried!!
I have joined forces with Ellen to adopt baby Dannielynn Smith. We are
not in it for the money - just like Howard (Stern that is). We have
discusssed it in detail via e-mails and SMS and the viewers of the
Ellen show all agree that we should at least fight the good battle and
lay claim to what is rightfully ours (simply because WE had frozen our
eggs for ANS and they were given to the GP for artificial insemination
or basting). Both Howard and Larry may have visitation rights, but
under no circumstances is Virgie allowed any contact with the baby, we
will not tolerate tardiness.
Unfortunately we were unable to attend the funeral, or to visit with
Dannielynn due to Ellen's prior commitments, and after Ellen's
emotional breakdown over the Oscars, I felt it too much for her to
take. However, we have arranged with our Attorneys to liaise closely
with Dannielynns attorneys to proceed with the adoption, but due to
being in Vietnam, (we are planning to adopt a Vietnamese baby, if this
adoption fails) Dannielynn may need to be flown to Vietnam to finalise
the paperwork, and so far we have had no appeals from any other family
members! We need to this within 3 weeks as we have no idea what Britney
may do next. Ellen is dancing her way to motherhood.
We will keep you updated on the Ellen show (Judge you are not the only
one on TV).
Who is Portia?
