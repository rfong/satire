Redpath's kick into space found only flanker Laurent Cabannes covering,
but the flanker, his left leg heavily strapped, hardly entered the
chase as Dods sped past him to touch down.
Centre Thomas Castaignede, whose late drop goal beat England a
fortnight ago, quickly replied with a well-struck penalty from 35
metres.
But Dods responded with a successful kick from a similar distance.
Then, after 20 minutes, he added another after French lock Olivier
Merle had been yellow carded for illegal use of the boot.
France's superiority at the line out brought them their only try after
23 minutes when flanker Abdelatif Benazzi collected and powered over
from a couple of yards out.
Scotland's exhilarating second try came after French scrum-half
Phillipe Carbonneau conceded a free-kick inside his own 22.
Led by Wainwright, the Scots charged towards the French line. Though
they were initially repulsed and Townsend was also held up Redpath was
in support of his partner.
The scrum-half missed out his centres to find Dods on the overlap and
although he initially had to juggle to control the ball, it could not
prevent him diving over from a few yards out.
France rallied and set up an exciting final 10 minutes with penalties
from Thierry Lacroix, who had taken over the kicking duties from
Castaignede.
The outside-half's two successful efforts, made him France's all time
top scorer with 357 points replacing Didier Camberabero (1982-93) who
scored 354 points, pulled the favourites to within two points of
Scotland.
But there was to be no denying the home side as Townsend launched them
forward with another huge kick.
When the French were penalised again, Dods calmly converted a difficult
kick to clinch a well-earned victory against all the odds.
