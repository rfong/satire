Lee Teng-hui's "Two States" Statement Severely Condemned 
An official from the Office for Taiwan Affairs under the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China has severely condemned Lee
Teng-hui's "two states" statement here today.
Under Lee's control, the weekend congress of the Kuomintang passed a
resolution to set the cross-Straits relation as "special state-to-state
relation"
Since Lee Teng-hui made the "two states" remarks on July 9, he has been
strongly criticized by the Chinese people, and the international
society has also repeated its adherence to the "one China" policy.
However, Lee stubbornly advocated his "two states" remarks, and went as
far as putting it into the Kuomintang resolution document, a very
dangerous step aimed at separating China, said the official.
"As Lee travels farther on the splittist road, the Chinese people
including Taiwanese compatriots will firmly fight against him, and
Lee's splittist attempt is doomed to fail," the official said.
His move of writing the "two states" remarks into party documents will
put an end to the future of the Kuomintang, and push Taiwanese people
to the abyss of war.
Lee Teng-hui has imposed his position on splitting China upon the
Kuomintang, which is a betrayal of not only the history of the party,
but also the Chinese nation, said the official.
He expressed his hope that insightful members of the Kuomintang can see
through the dangerous nature of Lee Teng-hui's splittist policy and act
responsibly on behalf of the 22 million Taiwanese compatriots.
