Exxon Mobil squirms, demands Corrupt Bastards' Supreme Court $2.5bn damages
appeal backing
The Exxon Mobil Corporation's executive board is demanding Corrupt Bastards
Club help in a DC Supreme Court appeal to overturn a $2.5 billion punitive
damages fine for their reckless destruction of the marine ecosystem in the
1989 Prince William Sound spillage disaster.
"You owe us!" was the stark message to Corrupt Bastard grandees in
Alaska as the Supreme Court stepped into the long-running battle over
the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
But with Corrupt Bastard Vic Kohring in an Anchorage dock charged with
being a VECO Corporation bribe-taking worm and top VECO executives
already washed up after a series of FBI busts this year, Exxon may be
alone as it trawls the murky depths of its Supreme Court appeal.
Eleven millions gallons of oil ravaged Alaskan waters when the Exxon
Valdez supertanker ran aground on a reef.
At the helm of Exxon's flagship tanker was a drunk whose navigation
skills were so minimal to begin with that every subsequent court
hearing has slammed the company as reckless beyod belief.
"Exxon placed a relapsed lush in command of an enormous vessel carrying
toxic cargo across treacherous and resource-rich waters," the original
adjudication confirmed.
"They knew he was drinking aboard their ship, but they thought they
could get away with it!"
Much Corrupt Bastards and Justice Department horse-trading has ensured
however that a federal appeals court already had cut in half the $5
billion in damages awarded by a jury in 1994.
Exxon has moaned in public that it already has paid $3.4 billion in
clean-up costs and other penalties.
"Enough is enough! Aren't there any law-perverting Corrupt Bastards
Club members we can rely on anymore to save our asses and our balance
sheet?" the company said today.
