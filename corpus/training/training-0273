Students Aid Deaf by Learning Sign Language 
Every weekend, Wu Xin, a student from Zhejiang University, and his
classmates gather in a local square in Hangzhou to talk in sign
language with the deaf and distribute pamphlets urging people to learn
the system of hand gestures.
"Using sign language does more for deaf people than just giving them
sympathy," said Wu, who became a volunteer after reading a notice on
campus asking people to assist the local deaf population by learning to
sign.
Currently more than 10,000 university students in this capital of
eastern Zhejiang Province are involved in the program. Participants
wear a red cap printed with the slogan: "Aid the Deaf with Love."
Su Lihui, from the Zhejiang Engineering Institute, is a veteran of that
school's Sign Language Service, which is the first of its kind in China
and has over 40 members who often go to streets, shops to serve as
go-betweens in matters involving deaf people.
The service is helpful on more than one level, Su said.
"In any situation where there is one hearing person who knows sign
language, a deaf person gets another opportunity to communicate with
someone on an equal footing," Su said.
Many people in the provincial capital and other cities have responded
to the students' call for volunteer signers, and local media,
government departments and enterprises have taken up the cause.
Sign language training centers, composed of members from local disabled
people federations, Communist Youth League committees, and volunteers,
are sending teams to different parts of the province to help the public
learn the hand language.
China has 60 million handicapped people. In Zhejiang, the number stands
at two million, including 900,000 deaf people. Official statistics show
the deaf population is increasing in the country because of population
aging, environmental pollution and accidents.
