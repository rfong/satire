Russian-NATO Talks Positive, But Differences Remain 
The third round of Russian-NATO negotiations on NATO's planned eastward
expansion ended here with no concrete results released, according to
the Itar-Tass News Agency today.
The latest negotiations were positive but differences remained on a
range of issues, the agency cited the Russian Foreign Ministry as
saying.
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov and NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana discussed issues relating to NATO's oft-stated eastward
expansion, including the alliance's responses to the previous proposals
from Moscow.
Russia still insists on making the Russia-NATO agreement a legal and
obligatory document while the Western alliance wants it to be a
charter.
The two previous rounds of negotiations were held respectively in
Moscow on January 20 and in Brussels on February 23.
After the end of the talks, Solana left Moscow for Central Asia Monday
on a weeklong tour to four former Soviet republics -- Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.
It is the first visit to Central Asia by a NATO chief since 1992 when
former NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner visited the region.
