Roundup: From Nairobi to Beijing (by Li Jianxiong) (Part 2)
The Economist magazine indicated that in the long run, providing women
with more and better education is the most effective way of reducing
population growth.
Statistics show that women with an education of seven years and up have
2.2 fewer children than those who never go to school, and that each
additional year of schooling for women can reduce by 9 percent the
mortality rate of children under five.
But, of the world's nearly one billion illiterates, two thirds are
women. Among women aged 25 and above in Africa and most of Asia, three
quarters are illiterates.
Considering women's health as a major part of social development, the
Nairobi strategies called for better health care services for women and
better family planning services by the year 2000.
The World Health Organization says that an improved economic and social
status as well as productive health care for women have reduced birth
rates.
The world birth rate during 1985-1990 declined by 10.5 percent from the
1975-1980 period. The number of governments providing direct support
for family planning rose from 97 to 125.
In China, married couples show great enthusiasm in family planning. The
rate of contraception has risen to as high as 83 percent.
Globally, 57 percent of couples of reproductive age use contraception.
Twenty million women use unsafe methods for abortion each year.
Teenage pregnancy is another serious problem. The rate of first
pregnancy among girls aged 15-19 is recorded at 18 percent in Africa, 8
percent in Latin America, 5 percent in North America, and 3 percent in
Europe.
Although great efforts have been made to improve women's health care,
there are big gaps in health services among countries. Owing to
amounting economic pressures, 37 least-developed countries have cut
their health care spending to half during the past four years.
Family violence and rape, which are also serious threats to women, lead
to depression, injuries, sexually transmitted diseases, suicide and
murder.
Also, the Nairobi strategies noted that war, armed conflicts and all
other activities threatening peace are major obstacles to the
advancement of women. Women should actively participate in safeguarding
world peace and security, especially the decision-making process.
Ever since the end of the Cold War, national, ethnic and religious
problems and historical hostilities have triggered dozens of regional
wars and armed conflicts, whose major victims are women.
By 1994, civil wars and other armed conflicts had left some 29 million
people homeless, of whom some 80 percent were women and children. These
women, driven away from their properties and homeland, are suffering
from broken families and hard life, even rape and other gender abuses.
A European Union fact-finding team estimates that more than 20,000
women have been raped in Bosnia since fighting began in April 1992.
In the past decade, women have contributed more to world peace and
security with their involvement in international affairs.
The United Nations had only one woman official at the
assistant-secretary-general level in 1979, but now it has six. Women
are holding one-quarter of those posts at the higher administration
level in the U.N. Population Fund and the World Food Organization.
Yet, of the 185 permanent representatives to the U.N., only six are
women. There are simply no female staff members in the permanent
missions of 67 U.N. member countries. Of the 32 special U.N. agencies,
only five are chaired by women. At the U.N. Secretariat, only 14
percent of higher administration posts are held by women, far from the
target of 30 percent for 1995 set by the U.N. Economic and Social
Council.
The Fourth World Conference on Women has opened in Beijing, which is
expected to review the implementation of the Nairobi strategies and
adopt a Platform of Action to ensure the realization of all the targets
for the year 2000 set forth in Nairobi.
From Nairobi to Beijing, women have been unceasingly striving for equal
rights and progress. Great hopes are placed on the Beijing conference
which will accelerate the implementation of the Nairobi strategies and
push ahead the drive further.
