Ningbo to Expand Transportation Sector 
Ningbo, a port city in east China's Zhejiang Province, has adopted an
ambitious plan to increase its handling capacity for both cargo and
passengers.
The plan calls for Ningbo Port to open more international freight
routes in order to increase its annual cargo handling capacity to 87
million tons.
The port will also introduce various preferential policies to increase
its container volume.
The city government plans to extend great efforts to transform Ningbo
Airport into an international class facility.
