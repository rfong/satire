Philippines asks US to hold deporation of Saudi businessman 
The Philippines said Monday it will ask the United States to delay the
deportation of a Saudi businessman while it investigates reports that
he had links with Filipino Moslem terrorists.
An official statement quoted President Fidel Ramos as saying "we have
asked (US) authorities there to hold" Mohammad Jamal Khalifa's
deportation from California to allow Manila to look into his alleged
"link with the local terrorists here."
Earlier Monday, Defense Secretary Renato De Villa said Khalifa was
suspected of having helped organize and finance the Abu Sayyaf, a
Moslem fundamentalist group that has massacred Christians in the
southern Philippines.
The Abu Sayyaf was believed to have led the raid on the southern town
of Ipil on April 4 that left 66 dead and the town's commercial center
burned to the ground.
De Villa said Khalifa was known to have stayed in the Philippines for
some time, even taking two Filipina wives and working with a Moslem
charity, the International Islamic Relief Organization.
De Villa did not provide further details.
The presidential palace statement said Khalifa, who is being held
without bail in San Francisco, is to be deported on charges of visa
fraud and fleeing from prosecution.
He has reportedly been sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia in
Jordan for bomb attacks of cinemas in 1994.
