Jiang Zemin Applauds China-Thailand Ties in Speech 
The Chinese government attaches importance to its ties with Thailand
and regards the country as one of China's most important cooperation
partners, President Jiang Zemin said here today.
Jiang arrived here Thursday for a state visit. He delivered a speech
entitled "Enhance Good-Neighborliness and Friendship and Build a Better
Future Together" to more than 1,000 Thais, including Princess
Sirindhorn. The speech was made at the National Cultural Center of
Thailand.
In the speech, Jiang said: "We are delighted to see the further
development of time-honored China-Thailand relations over the last
quarter of this century. Cooperation between our two countries has been
effective and productive in all fields."
A line from the song "the Chinese and Thais are brothers" expresses the
common will of the two peoples, Jiang said, adding that the king and
members of the royal family have made outstanding contributions to the
friendship between the two countries.
He wished that the bilateral relationship might last forever and become
more and more important as time goes by, like the porcelain masterpiece
"Sangkhalok" jointly made by Chinese and Thai craftsmen in ancient
times.
Prior to the speech, Jiang observed the royal barges in the company of
Princess Sirindhorn.
