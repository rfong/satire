Thailand to Join UN Sanction Against Sudan 
Thailand will join the United Nations' sanction against Sudan to ban
any Sudanese aircraft from flying over the country, according to a
press release from the government house here today.
The Thai caretaker cabinet today agreed to implement a UN resolution
adopted by the Security Council on August 16 this year to press Sudan
to stop supporting terrorists.
According to the resolution, UN member nations will deny landing,
departure or cross-border flying of any Sudanese aircraft.
The UN sanction measure will take effect on November 15 this year if
Sudan ignores the UN resolution.
