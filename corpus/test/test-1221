Zimbabwe's Mineral Earnings Shoot To 550 Million Dollars 
Zimbabwe's total mineral earnings for last year have shot up by 25
percent to hit 4.5 billion zimdollars (550 million US dollars), top
officials of the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe (MMCZ) and
the Chamber of Mines have said.
+Sunday Mail+ today quoted both Liz Chitiga, General Manager for MMCZ,
and Derek Bain, Chief Executive of the Chamber of Mines, as saying
there was substantial growth in mineral earnings and production during
the year because of increased investments in the sector.
Chitiga said minerals handled by the MMCZ shot to 2.5 billion from the
2.0 billion zimdollars in 1993 and would by next year have by far
outstripped tobacco which in the country is dubbed the 'gold leaf'.
Tobacco, which brought about 2.3 billion zimdollars last year, had for
a long time dominated foreign currency earnings for this country.
Chitiga said there were encouraging increases in earnings from
asbestos, ferro-alloys (which became the first single mineral after
gold to hit the billion zimdollars mark), nickel, black granite and
coke.
Bain said that gold earnings last year shot to 2.0 billion, rising from
1.4 billion zimdollars in 1993. The increase reflected an improvement
of more than 25 percent.
Production went up from 18.9 tonnes in 1993 to 20.564 tonnes last year.
Bain said there would be a substantial increase in production next year
because of one mine that was expected to reach full production during
the course of this year.
