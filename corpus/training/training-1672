In Washington, a State Department spokesman described the Berlin
meeting as "unproductive," adding that "we have not made the progress
in this latest round in Berlin that we had hoped to make."
Nick Burns said he had not been informed that the talks had broken
down, but added that from the North Korean side's comments, "you might
draw that conclusion."
However, he said, the US negotiators would remain in Berlin at least
until the weekend and remained willing to continue talks with the North
Korean side.
The spokesman also warned that if North Korea broke the freeze on its
nuclear programme, the United States would discuss with its allies
taking the issue back before the UN Security Council.
But, he added, "I have no indication today that North Korea has taken
that decision."
