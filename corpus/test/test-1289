Thousands of Hutus killed in Burundi in April-July
The Tutsi-led army in Burundi killed thousands of Hutu civilians
between April and July, a UN report said.
The UN report, a copy of which was obtained by AFP Monday, was the
first mention of these new massacres in the violence-wracked central
African country.
It was prepared by a team of five UN observers who went to Burundi on
April 19 for a human rights fact-finding mission. They were based in
Bujumbura, but also went out into rural areas.
The report, slated for release Monday, said that the last few months in
Burundi had been marked by the massacres of civilians, assassinations,
disappearances and arbitrary arrests.
