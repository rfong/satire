Bowen extends lead at Komen International
Nanci Bowen carded a one-over-par 73 here on Friday but still extended her
lead to two strokes midway through the LPGA Susan G. Komen International
golf tournament.
Bowen, coming off a career-best seven-under 65, had two bogeys and a
birdie and finished with nine straight pars to move to 138, two strokes
ahead of LPGA Hall of Famer Patty Sheehan and Tina Barrett.
Helen Alfredsson of Sweden, Brandie Burton and Maggie Will-Halpin both
carded even-par 72 and were tied for fourth on 141.
Alfredsson's countrywoman, 1997 LPGA money leader Annika Sorenstam, was
four shots back at 142, tied with Michelle McGann and Juli Inkster.
