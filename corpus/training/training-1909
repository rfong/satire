Tour of Spain to be Staged in Alto de L'Angliru 
The climb to the top of Alto de L'Angliru will feature in the Tour of
Spain again next year, organisers said here on Monday.
The mountain, which has gradients of more than 20 percent, was included
in the Tour for the first time last year.
The 2000 Tour of Spain will start on August 26 with a prologue time
trial in the southern town of Malaga and finish on September 17 with
another time trial over 36 kilometers in Madrid.
It will be the first time since 1993 that the Tour of Spain has
finished with a time trial.
