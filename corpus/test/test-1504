Aschcroft Says Associates of Hijackers May Still Be in U.S. 
U.S Attorney General John Aschcroft said Monday that associates of the
hijackers who used airplanes to hit the World Trade Center in New York
and the Defense Department building in Washington may still be in the
United States.
"(FBI director Robert) Mueller and I discussed the current threat
assessment, including our belief that associates of the hijackers may
be a continued presence in the United States," Aschcroft said at a
press conference.
