Baggio salutes Jack's army reopens
Roberto Baggio admitted Italy had been stunned by the strength of
Ireland's support in Giants Stadium on Saturday. "I must congratulate
the Irish on their organisation," Italy's star player said. "We
expected it to be 50-50 but somehow they managed to get most of the
tickets. The Italians must have been drinking their capuccino and
espresso while the Irish were finding tickets and getting ready. With
all their flags it was like a completely Irish crowd." 
German grounds for complaint
FIFA have had to tackle a storm in a coffee cup in Chicago. The German
media had kicked up a fuss about the standard of coffee served at the
press centre, one journalist saying: "It was as though it had been
strained through a pair of socks." Now world football's governing body
has decided to serve a German brand of coffee to appease the
dissenters.
