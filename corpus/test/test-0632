For three hours or so England and their fans had harboured hopes of an
epic recovery in this third Cornhill Test.
Cork -- nursing a badly bruised finger of his own -- added three more
prize scalps to the one wicket he had gained the evening before as West
Indies stumbled from 104 for one to 198 for six.
At that stage the tourists were only 51 runs ahead. But then Lady Luck
turned her back on England and smiled serenely in Richardson's
direction.
Television replays suggested that Zimbabwe umpire Ian Robinson should
have upheld an appeal for a catch behind when West Indies captain was
facing Angus Fraser and had scored only four.
Then, on 25, Richardson was reprieved by Atherton at slip. Cork found
the outside edge but a low, right-handed chance failed to stick.
Those two incidents proved major turning points.
For having clawed their way back from a horrible first day position,
England were slowly but surely put on the defensive once more by
Richardson.
His innings of 69 was full of character and concentration -- a perfect
riposte to those Caribbean supporters who called for his head under the
Lord's pavilion less than a fortnight ago following a series-levelling
home victory.
Bishop helped him to add 62 precious runs for the seventh wicket and,
by the time spinner Richard Illingworth winkled out the tailender, West
Indies were back in control.
Richardson's century hopes were effectively ended when first Kenny
Benjamin and then Walsh fell victim to TV replay run out decisions.
But his own dismissal -- last out when bowled off an inside edge by
Fraser -- merely gave Bishop and co 85 minutes to wreak havoc.
Smith and Cork found an answer to the challenge but by then it looked
as though too much damage had been done.
