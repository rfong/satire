Chirac, Clinton Agree UN-Iraq Accord Be Implemented 
French President Jacques Chirac and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed
Monday that the agreement reached by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should be implemented "as soon as
possible," said French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
During a half-an-hour telephone conversation, Chirac and Clinton agreed
that according to the information received so far, the agreement seems
to "completely conform to the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council
resolutions and be loyal to the recommendations made by the five
permanent members of the Security Council" before Annan left for
Baghdad.
The two presidents also agreed that the United Nations Security Council
should work on and make an announcement -- approval or not -- on the
agreement as soon as Annan presents it Tuesday, said Colonna.
Annan arrived here Monday evening from Baghdad after completing
successfully his "impossible mission" during which he struck a deal
with Saddam Hussein on U.N. inspection of eight presidential sites.
The U.N. chief will fly back to New York Tuesday morning.
