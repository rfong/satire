With Canada-EU-Fish 
The European Union on Friday issued its first sanction against Canada
in the escalating war over fishing rights in the North Atlantic and
threatened more could be on the way.
EU research ministers withdrew plans to sign off on a scientific
cooperation pact with Canada, only hours after the 15-nation EU
condemned Ottowa for seizing a Spanish fishing vessel outside Canada's
territorial waters.
At an emergency meeting on the transatlantic dispute early Friday,
deputy EU ambassadors called the arrest ``a lawless act against the
sovereignty of a member state of the European Union.''
In a statement, they demanded ``that Canada immediately release the
vessel, report any damages caused, and cease and desist from its
harassment of vessels flying the flag of (EU) member states.''
They said EU governments ``reserve their rights to take any action
which they deem appropriate.''
The EU's executive Commission was preparing an ``inventory of
measures'' for more trade or political retaliation, which will be
presented to governments early next week, an EU official, who demanded
anonymity, said.
A Canadian military ship late Thursday seized the Estai, one of five
Spanish vessels fishing just outside Canadian waters off Newfoundland.
The arrest followed escalating threats from Ottawa in a bid to get
Spanish and Portuguese boats to stop fishing for Greenland halibut, or
turbot.
Last year, both sides agreed to an overall limit for 1995 of 27,000
tons of halibut. Canada claims 60 percent, or 16,300 tons. The EU wants
69 percent, or 18,600 tons, which would represent dlrs 130 million
worth of halibut this year.
Late Thursday, EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino called the seizure
of the Estai ``organized piracy in international waters.''
Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin told BBC radio that the action
was necessary.
``Some 340,000 tons of fish, seven or eight species have disappeared
from the planet because this fleet, unrestrained and uncontrolled by
the European Union, has fished away one species after another,'' he
said.
