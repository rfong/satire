Two of Sextuplets in Northeast China Die of Lung Hemorrhage
Two of the sextuplets born Wednesday in this capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province have died of lung hemorrhages, hospital
sources said here today.
"We've lost one baby boy and one baby girl. They were the lightest ones
of the six," said Dr. Mao Jian from the New-Born Intensive Care
Department of the No. 2 Hospital Attached to the China Medical
University.
The sextuplets, who were born at around 7:30 on the evening of December
23, included four boys and two girls.
The boy who died 70 hours after his birth was the lightest of the six,
weighing only 495 grams. Efforts to save his life lasted more than an
hour but to no avail.
The girl, who weighed 610 grams at birth, died Saturday despite a
successful blood transfusion and the use of a respirator.
"It's not surprising to me. The two babies were too small when born,"
said Li Quanyou, father of the sextuplets, after a moment of silence
when he learned the bad news.
Hospital authorities say that at present, the conditions of the other
four babies are relatively stable, but it's still too early to say that
they are already out of the critical period.
"Conditions of prematurely born babies change extremely rapidly. Though
the rest of the babies have overcome respiratory difficulties, there
could possibly be other problems," explained Dr. Mao.
