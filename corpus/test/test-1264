Chilean Businessmen Concerned Over Pinochet Crisis 
Chilean businessmen expressed Thursday their concern over the effects
the Augusto Pinochet case can have on their business.
National Chamber of Commerce President Fernando Lihn voiced his support
to the actions of the government related to Pinochet detention in
London, where he has been detained for 55 days.
He said that the trade relations with Spain and Great Britain should
not be affected in principle and that if there is a deterioration in
the relations, "the only loser will be Chile."
"We sell them 10 and they buy one from us. We are the big losers," said
Lihn.
He said that the government has talked clearly" about not breaking
relations with none of the two countries, which are the biggest foreign
investors in Chile and have capitals in sectors such as banking and
energy.
However, Pinochet sympathizers who have harassed the Spanish and
British diplomatic missions have asked the authorities to break
relations with both and to boycott their products.
They also want the ambassadors of the two countries to be declared
"persona non grata."
