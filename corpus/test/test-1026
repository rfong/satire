Controversial referee named for quarter-final 
Controversial Swedish referee Leif Sundell, who missed a blantant
penalty in the Holland-Scotland group match has been rewarded with a
quarter-final game.
Sundell, who was bitterly criticised by Dutch coach Guus Hiddink who
feared the mistake could cost his side a place in the next round, will
be in charge of the Germany-Croatia match-up.
During the Holland match Celtic midfielder John Collins handled on the
line from a Clarence Seedorf shot, but Sundell ignored Dutch appeals
and waved play on.
"It was definitely handball and Collins even admitted it. But the
referee was standing in a very bad position. At international level you
have to see things like that. It was a big and bad mistake. That
shouldn't happen," fumed Hiddink.
Quarter-final referees:
Spain-England, Marc Batta (Fra)
France-Netherlands, Manuel Lopez Nieto (Spa)
Germany-Croatia, Leif Sundell (Swe)
Czech Republic-Portugal, Hellmut Krug (Ger)
Referees nominated for semi-finals and final:
Leslie Mottram (Scot), Sandor Puhl (Hun), Pierluigi Pairetto (Ita).
Who referees which match will be decided this Sunday after the
