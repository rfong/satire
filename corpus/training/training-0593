Singapore hangs Thai woman for drug trafficking 
Singapore on Friday hanged a 32-year-old Thai woman for drug
trafficking, two years after she was caught here carrying 3.2 kilos
(seven pounds) of heroin from Bangkok, the Central Narcotics Bureau
said.
Navarat Maykha was stopped at Singapore's Changi airport after flying
in from the Thai capital on August 12, 1993. Customs officers found the
heroin stashed in her luggage, the bureau statement said.
She was charged two days later with importing heroin and sentenced to
death by the High Court in July 1994. Her appeal was dismissed last
April.
More than 100 people have been hanged in Singapore since the 1975 under
a tough law making the death sentence mandatory for anyone found guilty
of trafficking at least 15 grams (half an ounce) of heroin.
