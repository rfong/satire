Neste doubles dividend after 11-percent profits rise 
The state-owned Finnish oil and gas company Neste has doubled the
dividend after increasing pre-tax profits after financial items to 1.36
billion Finnish marks (296.5 million dollars) in 1995, Neste said on
Friday.
In 1994, the group, which specializes in petrol, natural gas, chemicals
and maritime transports, had reported a profit of 1.23 billion marks
(267.6 million dollars).
The board decided to double the dividend to 2.40 marks, representing a
total distribution of 236 million marks.
Sales declined by 12 percent to 43.3 billion marks (9.42 billion
dollars) from 49.2 billion marks in 1994. The drop in sales was
"largely due to planned reductions in trading volumes, as well as
vessel sales and the weakening of the US dollar in exchange rates,"
Neste said.
Operating profits fell by five percent to 2.14 billion marks (465.6
million dollars) from 2.24 billion marks in 1994.
With operations in 30 countries, Neste, which employed 8,166 employees
at the end of 1995, is Finland's largest industrial group.
Neste improved its financial situation last year, cutting its debt by
25 percent to 12.9 billion marks at the end of 1995 from 16.1 billion
dollars one year earlier.
By sector, Neste's gas and petrol reserves increased in value to 4.8
billion billion marks from 4.1 billion marks, while the "chemicals
industry registered a boom in the second half of 1995," the group said.
Investments during the period increased by 57 percent to 2.16 billion
marks from 1.37 billion marks in 1994.
For 1996, Neste said that "the crude oil price is not likely to
increase, and prospects for the oil refining industry in Europe remain
unchanged."
In the first two months of 1996, "plastics prices have climbed
slightly," the group said, while not providing any figures for the
financial results expected in 1996.
Neste reiterated that it has "explored the possible disposal" of its
stake in the Nordic group Borealis, the leading European producer of
the plastic polyolefines, based in Denmark.
"Negociations have been conducted with prospective buyers, but detailed
information on the prospective sale cannot be given due to the state of
negotiations," Neste said.
Borealis was created in January 1994 by the merger of the
petrochemicals divisions of Neste and Norway's Statoil. It is the
world's fifth-largest producer of polyolefines, and employs some 6,500
people around the world.
