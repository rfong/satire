Haley Scarnato to Sue Blake Lewis Over American Idol Shorts Stitch-up
Ousted American Idol contestant Haley Scarnato, who almost became famous
for her ever-decreasing clothing as the show progressed, is to sue fellow
contestant Blake Lewis for allegedly sabotaging her chances by deliberately
mis-stitching her shorts.
Ms Scarnato, 24, is alleging that Blake Lewis, almost famous for making
his own pants, offered to help her with her shrinking wardrobe by
creating an extra-skimpy pair of satin shorts for the show's Latin
themed night which eventually saw her eliminated.
In an statement issued by her lawyers, Ms Scarnato states: "When he
heard that I was having trouble with my shorts, Blake offered to make a
pair for me. As I'm a big fan of his pants, I immediately accepted,
thinking he would do a wonderful job, but what I didn't realise was
that he deliberately didn't use his normal Singer sewing machine, but
made my shorts on a Karaoke instead."
Ms Scarnato's lawsuit alleges that as a result of Mr Lewis' underhanded
stitch-up, her performance was below-par and led to her ejection from
the show. The fact that judge Randy Jackson clearly stated that her
performance was "just Karaoke for me, dawg" is cited as proof of the
effect that Lewis' dastardly switch had on Ms Scarnato that night.
The lawsuit further alleges that Sanjaya Malakar, almost famous for his
wacky hairdos, conspired with Lewis by advising Ms Scarnato to wear her
hair in an unflattering style that evening, further contributing to her
demise.
Neither Mr Lewis (who was too busy with his needle and thread), nor Mr
Malakar (curling tongs) were available for comment last night. Simon
Cowell was available for comment, as usual, but had nothing positive to
say about anything so we declined to quote him.
