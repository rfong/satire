Syria expects to build understanding in talks with Israel 
Syria said that peace talks with Israel beginning Wednesday in the
United States will be based on creating a "framework of understanding"
between the two countries.
Describing the talks as "very important but exploratory," Syria's
official radio said that "Israel's recognition of a complete withdrawal
(from the Golan Heights) is very important and is the prelude to a real
and permanent peace."
Syria is demanding the complete return of the strategic Golan plateau,
which Israel seized in the 1967 war and annexed in 1981.
The negotiations that begin Wednesday outside Washington are being held
in a "climate of prudent optimism" and are "a real test of Israel's
intentions," the radio said.
"Damascus is ready to accept equal and fair security arrangements that
do not affect Syrian sovereignty," the radio said, adding that "a just
and global peace is the sole guarantee of security and stability" in
the Middle East.
Peace talks between Israel and Syria broke down in June over security
arrangements on the Golan Heights after any Israeli withdrawal.
The radio also said that progress on the Syrian track would lead to
eventual peace with Lebanon as well.
