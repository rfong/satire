Home Secretary Jaqui Kennedy Onassis Smith Warns Brown about Downturn!
Britons were struck incredulous when they discovered that Home
Secretary Smith was the widow of JFK and Aristotle Onassis. More shock
came from a leaked document from the Secretary that warned PM Brown
about the impending cataclysm facing the UK from the critical economic
downturn.
Smith admonished the Prime Minister to be on the look out for the
following social crisis:
* Fish and Blue Chips will skyrocket in price!
* Skinheads will become even more electable than their balding Labor
party look alikes
* Which will inflame Al-Qaida in Liverpool and every other terrorist
franchise now operating in the UK
* Cocaine prices will rise, while snorting of the happy dust will
fall, even at the Bailey!
* Alcohol distributors will have to drop prices unless they want to
see all of England go through the DT's
Sources close to Brown said the PM plans to support an alcohol drinks
tax rebate to keep the UK from an overpopulation of pink elephants.
