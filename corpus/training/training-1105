Macau bars water, vegetables from China in cyanide alert 
Macau stepped up a health alert Thursday after cyanide leaked into a
Chinese river, announcing a ban on individual imports of vegetables
from the mainland after suspending imports of Chinese water, officials
there said.
Macau government information officer Isabelle Ho, reached by telephone
from Hong Kong, said the authorities had issued a notice prohibiting
individuals from bringing in vegetables from China without prior
authorisation.
However, wholesale imports of vegetable and food from China were still
arriving in Macau through official channels, she said.
"Normal imports of daily supplies of meat and seafood have not been
affected. Everything is being checked and remains normal," Ho said.
There are small, but relatively significant, amounts of food that are
brought in by Macau individuals, who benefit from a big price
difference between China and Macau, she explained.
Ho declined to make any link between the ban and the cyanide incident
and insisted, "there is no scare in the territory."
Over 80 drums, each containing 50 kilogrammes (110 pounds) of sodium
cyanide, fell from a truck Tuesday into the Guijiang river, which
eventually flows into the heavily populated Pearl River Delta.
More than 10 cannisters opened and spilled their contents, Chinese
officials said.
Chinese authorities Thursday said all the barrels had been recovered
and tests showed there was not a dangerous level of the chemical in the
river or drinking water.
Shortly after the incident, Macau suspended imports of water from the
mainland China.
Ho said the population in Macau could survive on its own reservoir for
at least 45 days.
"The total capacity of the Macau reservoir now stands at eight million
cubic meters (280 million cubic feet). It can easily meet our daily
average water consumption of 140,000 cu. m. (4.9 million cu. ft.)," she
said.
