Philippine President to Visit Japan, U.S., Canada 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos will visit Japan, the United States
and Canada in a 15-day tour to assure the international community that
the Philippines remains an "investment haven" in Asia despite a
currency crisis in the region.
Ramos' trips to Japan and the United States are working visits, while
his Canada tour is an official state visit, a news release from the
Presidential Palace said today.
Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista said about 150 leading
Filipino businessmen will accompany Ramos during his trip starting on
November 18.
More than 1 billion U.S. dollars worth of private sector agreements are
expected to be forged during Ramos' visits.
The president will also seek the cooperation of the leaders of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in solving the Southeast Asian
currency crisis at the fifth APEC Leaders' Meeting in Vancouver.
Ramos said the results of his trips will be "very, very crucial" to his
country and the region because he will elevate to the APEC meeting the
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) initiative on a regional
establishment of a common monetary facility.
The initiative will be discussed during the meeting of deputy finance
ministers and central bank governors in Asia-Pacific region to be held
next week in Manila.
