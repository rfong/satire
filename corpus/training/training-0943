Franc rises on Chirac victory 
The French franc and the Paris bourse both rose Sunday after
neo-Gaullist Jacques Chirac won the French presidential election.
Banks had opened from 8:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) to 10:00 p.m. to register
the first reactions of operators using the Globex electronic trading
system.
The franc closed at 3.54 against the German mark, up from 3.5735 at
Friday's close.
On the bonds market the Pibor index, registering the three-month rate,
rose to 93.12, equivalent to an interest rate of 6.88 percent.
Brokers stressed that the movements were recorded on a flat market with
few foreign investors involved.
Futures options on the CAC-40, the main stock index at the Paris
bourse, rose two percent in light trading on Globex, dealers said.
A trader with the Indosuez bank said financial circles were relieved by
Chirac's victory over Socialist Lionel Jospin. "The markets did not
like the drastic change that a victory by Lionel Jospin would have
meant," the trader said.
The bourse had expected Chirac to win. After dropping 15 percent since
the beginning of the year, it has risen nine percent since mid-March.
But the markets will adopt a cautious approach in coming days as they
await Chirac's policy on unemployment, the budget deficit, the franc,
France's position on an EU intergovernmental conference due next year
and plans for a single EU currency, an official at Credit Commercial de
France said.
Projections of Sunday's poll gave Chirac, a two-time former prime
minister, around 52 percent of the vote, with 48 percent to Jospin.
French and British financial markets will be closed Monday to mark the
50th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War
II.
