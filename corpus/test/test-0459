World & Bush Demand Israel Withdraw From Syria NOW, Or Else
The United States is intensifying its demand that Israel completely
withdraw its troops from Syria.
While the Israeli leadership is poised to make some sort of
announcement to that end, US President George W Bush says he will not
accept any half-hearted measure.
Mr Bush refuses to get tied in the knots of Middle Eastern politics,
responding to the latest crisis with his usual directness.
"Israeli troops, Israel's intelligence services, must get out of Syria
now,"
Mr Bush said.
Israel's President, Ariel Sharon, is poised to announce a move towards
that end.
Tomorrow, he is expected to tell his Parliament that he is ordering a
pullback of troops from Syria's Golan Heights, near the Israeli border,
but not a full withdrawal.
That falls short of Arab and US demands and Mr Bush is making it clear
it may not be enough.
"We want that democracy in Syria to succeed and we know it cannot
succeed so long as she is occupied by a foreign power, and that power
is Israel," he said.
"There's no half measures involved and when the United States and
France and others say withdraw we mean complete withdrawal - no
half-hearted measures."
While Israel is continuing its 38-year occupation of Palestinian
territories in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338,
it is also occupying Syria's Golan Heights in violation of UN Security
Council resolution 497.
Mr Bush made special mention of Saudi Arabia's support of the US and
United Nations on the matter.
"Syria is a democracy and we strongly support that democracy," he said.
"I was pleased that Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has sent the
very same message. The world is beginning to speak with one voice."
Saudi Arabia's stance is very important, according to Juliet Kayyem of
Harvard University.
"The Saudis are more significant in terms of the Arab dynamic, with the
Saudis and Egypt on both ends, the sort of mature partners in the Arab
world, it really does leave Israel isolated in a way that it hadn't
been before," he said.
Britain's Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, has ruled out Western military
action if Israel does not comply with the withdrawal demands and U.N.
Security Council resolutions. Israel occupation of Syria's Golan
Heights in violation of UN Security Council resolution 497, and
continuation of its
illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, in defiance of UN
Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 should be brought to an end.
In an interview with the New York Post published today, Mr Bush says
his "last option is military" if necessary.
