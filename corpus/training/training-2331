International golfers feel the heat in President's Cup
A young international squad felt the heat on Saturday as America's
experienced golfers continued to apply the pressure in the inaugural
President's Cup match-play tournament.
The hot, humid weather forced the star of the international squad,
British Open champion Nick Price, to skip the afternoon alternate-shot
foursomes.
After winning three-and-a-half of the five points on offer in the
opening four-ball matches, the non-European Internationals team won
just two of five foursomes to trail 12-8 before Sunday's final 12
singles matches.
"I just have no strength at all," said Price, who has won six
tournaments this year. "I would have really struggled if I'd had to
play the afternoon."
International team captain David Graham of Australia said Price was
slightly dehydrated, and he expected him to be fit for Sunday's
singles.
Price had played 36 holes on Friday and 18 on Saturday morning, when he
and Australian Steve Elkington halved their match with Phil Mickelson
and Corey Pavin.
Several golfers said the weather made playing 36 holes a day a daunting
prospect.
David Frost of South Africa and Peter Senior of Australia were left out
of the four ball line-up, started fresh and beat Hale Irwin and Jay
Haas 6 and 5 in the first alternate-shot match.
Frost contributed a hole-in-one to their effort, knocking in a
four-iron from 210 yards at the par-three fourth.
For a while it looked as if the internationals might be able to pull
level, but the United States pairs of Phil Mickelson-Tom Lehman and
Corey Pavin-Loren Roberts pulled off spectacular comeback victories.
As the steamy weather gave way to rain, Pavin and Roberts blasted away
to snatch a 1-up victory over Australian Craig Parry and South African
Fulton Allem.
Allem and Parry were 3-up through 12, but had dropped back to
all-square coming to the 18th.
