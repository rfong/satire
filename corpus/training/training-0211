French FM Raps Israel Delay of Wye Agreement 
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine lashed out at Israel Friday for
its delay of implementing the peace accord it signed with the
Palestinians last week.
The Israeli cabinet announced an indefinite delay of its debate on the
accord after Palestinian militants launched a bomb attack on West
Jerusalem earlier Friday, killing two and injuring 21.
"They (Israel) should first begin to apply the agreements of Wye
Plantation ... if they really want to relaunch the peace process,"
Vedrine was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse.
He regretted that the Israeli leaders always use "tragic events," such
as bomb attacks, to "justify a dilatory attitude" toward the
implementation of peace agreements with Palestinians.
After the bombing in the West Jerusalem market, the Israeli government
set out two preconditions before it would approve the Wry River accord.
It asks the Palestinian Authority to take firm steps to combat against
terrorist organizations and show evidence that the Palestinians
"respect all their commitments in the accord."
