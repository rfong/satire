Gingrich sees 2-week extension of stopgap spending bill from Friday 
The US House of Representatives will approve a two-week extension to a
temporary spending bill from Friday if there is no agreement with
President Bill Clinton on financing still-unfunded programs, Speaker
Newt Gingrich said here Tuesday.
"I think we could pass a two-week extension," Gingrich said after
leaving a National Association of Home Builders conference.
The House last week passed an appropriations bill that would fund the
government for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30,
and the Senate was set to vote on a similar measure Tuesday.
But Clinton has vowed to veto the legislation on grounds that it cuts
too deeply into spending on education, the environment and health care
programs.
The current stopgap bill expires at midnight March 15 and the threat of
a presidential veto had raised fears here of another partial shutdown
of the federal government, similar to those of late last year and
January.
The money is needed for nine Cabinet departments and several other
agencies that have so far this fiscal year been living on temporary
appropriations.
They have been caught in a lingering dispute between the administration
and the Republican-controlled Congress on social spending.
The House bill would add 3.4 billion dollars to the budget and the
Senate measure 4.7 billion. But Clinton is demanding that eight billion
dollars be restored in order to preserve domestic programs.
Political analysts here had predicted that Congressional Republicans
would avoid another showdown with the White House at the start of a
presidential campaign and would send Clinton a straightforward bill to
keep the agencies running for several more weeks.
In confrontations late last year, polls made it clear that the
electorate held Congress responsible for the deadlock.
The temporary measure would probably allow the agencies to limp along
under an authorization to spend no more than 75 percent of the funding
level in fiscal 1995.
