Berlin gets new "red-red" coalition government 
A new government for the financial crisis-hit German capital, led by
Social Democrats (SPD) with East Germany's former communists as their
coalition partner, was voted into office Thursday.
The nine members of the cabinet, headed by Berlin's SPD mayor Klaus
Wowereit, 48, each had to be approved in a vote by members of the
Berlin city-state parliament.
The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) has three of the
cabinet posts, with the party's most prominent figure, Gregor Gysi, 54,
being put in charge of the economy.
The SPD has the other six cabinet posts, including that of Wowereit and
the key finance minister (senator) position, which has gone to former
railways manager Thilo Sarrazin.
