France on Sunday flew 39 tonnes of emergency aid to Iran, where nearly
2,400 people were killed and thousands more injured in an earthquake at
the weekend, the foreign ministry said.
The ministry said a government-chartered plane had left Paris bound for
Mashhad, the capital of Khorasan province in eastern Iran, carrying
blankets, tents, clothing and food. The plane is due to land on Sunday
afternoon and will deliver its cargo to the Iranian Red Crescent.
