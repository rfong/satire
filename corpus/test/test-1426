Vice-Premier Stresses Enterprise Reform 
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo stressed that the key to the reform of
state-owned enterprises is to strengthen leadership and pay great
attention to the implementation of the reform measures by taking into
consideration the actual situations of various localities.
Wu, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China, made the remark during his inspection
tour of east China's Jiangsu Province from April 9 to 13.
The vice-premier visited a series of large enterprises in Nanjing,
Yangzhou and Xuzhou, including the Panda Brand Electronics Enterprise
Group, the Yangtze Petrochemicals Corp. and Yizheng Joint Corporation
of Chemical Fiber Industry.
He noted that through years of experiments and exploration, the country
has made great headway in reforming state-owned enterprises. And the
Central Party Committee and the State Council have set explicit
policies and principles for reforming them.
Wu stressed that this year priority should be given to certain aspects
in enterprise reform: First, further liberate minds, be bold in blazing
new trails and quicken the pace of reform; and second, strengthen
leadership, step up co-operation and coordination by easing disputes
between various departments and sectors.
He urged various localities to invigorate both large and small
enterprises and adhere to the principle of combining reform and
renovation with reinforcement of enterprise administration, and take
active and prudent steps in pushing forward annexation and bankruptcy
of enterprises and in enliving liquid assets.
As for the problems cropping up in the management of the state-owned
enterprises, the vice-premier urged the efficient enterprises to adopt
various forms and try all means to solve the problem of circulation
funds.
Wu called for various enterprises to increase economic returns by
further tapping the potentials of the existing facilities instead of
developing new projects.
He also called for earnest efforts to be made to stimulate the
transformation of economic growth modes.
