Dhlakama to Visit Germany 
Afonso Dhlakama, leader of Mozambican National Resistance (MNR), the
largest opposition party in the country, will start a week-long visit
to Germany Monday to enlist investment for Maputo at the invitation of
Bonn.
The Mozambican News Agency today quoted a figure from the office of the
MNR president as having confirmed the news.
He refused to be named and also refused to give more details.
Dhlakama's visit to Germany is reportedly aimed at "building confidence
and making the ties of cooperation between the two peoples, government
organs and non-governmental organizations (ngos) closer in various
fields."
He will call on leaders of the federal government, political parties,
parliamentary deputies, ngos and businessmen in a bid to "encourage
them to invest in Mozambique," the news agency said.
It is the first visit abroad Dhlakama pays this year, and he made trips
to France, Spain and South Africa last year.
