Butt joins England's injury list 
England coach Sven Goran Eriksson was hit by the Old Trafford injury
jinx once again on Wednesday after Nicky Butt damaged knee ligaments to
make him a possible doubt for this summer's World Cup.
The Manchester United midfielder was injured in training on Monday and
missed Wednesday's Premiership clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford.
Butt joins his United and England team-mates David Beckham and Gary
Neville on the sidelines and the club said he could be out for at least
two weeks.
But United manager Alex Ferguson said he was confident Butt would be
able to meet up with the squad in time for the finals in Japan and
South Korea.
Eriksson will name his provisional 23-man squad for the Worlde that he
will recover in time and put the likes of Frank Lampard, Danny Murphy
or Trevor Sinclair on stand-by in case he does not make it.
