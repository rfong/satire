State-Owned Asset Evaluation Regulations to Be Formulated
The paper quoted an official of the State Administration of State-owned
Assets as saying that the regulations are intended to improve the
efficiency of evaluating state-owned assets and make sure that such
evaluation is scientific and impartial.
"The asset evaluation business has been growing rapidly in China over
the past few years," it said.
At the end of last year China had 2,394 asset evaluation agencies,
undertaking 33,899 projects and evaluating assets worth 754.2 billion
yuan in 1994.
In 1991, China had 476 such agencies, involved in 4,958 projects and
evaluating assets worth 40.4 billion yuan that year.
The official said that such agencies are playing a major role in
preventing a drain on state-owned assets.
He also vowed that China will expand the asset evaluation business in
line with internationally accepted practices.
