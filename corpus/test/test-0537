Afghan authorities plan massive raid to flush out Omar
Afghan authorities are planning a massive operation with the help of US
Marines to flush out Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar from his hiding
place in southern Afghanistan, an official said Tuesday.
Haji Gulalai, chief of intelligence in Kandahar province, said Omar's
fate was being negotiated with his supporters, but if the talks failed
the raid would be launched in three or four days.
Gulalai said military commanders in Helmand province were sheltering
Omar, who has been on the run since the hated Taliban militia was
defeated in Kandahar city on December 7.
Members of the al-Qaeda network of terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden
are hiding out with the Taliban chief in or around Helmand province
which borders Kandahar, he told AFP by telephone.
"For the last 25 years local commanders were the lords of their areas,"
Gulalai said. "If someone did not obey him, they would have killed that
person.
"There are some areas still controlled by those commanders. And those
commanders are harbouring Mullah Omar."
Omar is wanted by US authorities for harbouring bin Laden, the alleged
mastermind of the September 11 terrorist atrocities in the United
States who is also missing since the Taliban's defeat.
Gulalai said the "clean-up" operation, involving 4,000 to 5,000 Afghan
soldiers backed by US Marines, was also aimed at gathering illegal
weapons and was originally due to start early Tuesday.
However, tribal leaders urged a postponement to allow negotiations to
be held.
"Tribal elders from Helmand province requested us not to launch this
operation and have asked us to solve the issue of collecting arms and
also the issue of Mullah Omar through talks and negotiations," he said.
"Our negotiation with the people of Mullah Omar have been continuing,"
Gulalai said. "Ulemas (religious leaders), tribal elders and
intellectuals have been working with us on it."
Gulalai said he believed there was an 80 percent chance "that these
talks will lead to success and that this issue will be solved through
talks and negotiation." If not, the raid would go ahead as planned.
"These 4,000 to 5,000 mujahedin are based outside Kandahar city in
military bases. If we are weak or need help or assistance,
international and allied forces will ... help us," he said.
US television network CNN said "a couple of hundred" Marines were
involved in the operation, working alongside anti-Taliban forces loyal
to Kandahar strongman Gul Agha.
Afghanistan's new government Tuesday defended the US bombing campaign
which helped bring it to power, saying American planes had "no other
choice" but to attack an eastern village despite civilian deaths.
The Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) said at least 92
civilians were killed in the US bombing of Nizai Qala in Paktia
province overnight Saturday.
Local people said at least 70 people including some foreigners
reportedly died.
Border Affairs Minister Amanullah Zadran said the bombing was the only
way to destroy a large weapons cache in a farmhouse guarded by Taliban
and al-Qaeda sympathisers.
"I'm not supporting the bombing (of innocent people) but there was no
other choice," Zadran told AFP. "By land it would have been risky. It
was a very insecure situation. There is still some opposition in the
area."
AIP quoted a witness saying there were no al-Qaeda or Taliban members
there.
Zadran, who visited Paktia on Monday, said that when al-Qaeda and
Taliban fled the province, they left "truckloads of weapons, documents
and vehicles" in the farmhouse.
"The Americans bombed it and the people left there were killed," he
said. "There were no al-Qaeda and Taliban there, but their supporters
were in the house."
A US military spokesman expressed regret at any civilian deaths but
said the raid hit a legitimate target.
In other moves against al-Qaeda, Pakistan's Dawn newspaper reported
that about 150 of its members would be shifted from a Pakistani jail to
an American prison camp at Kandahar airport for more intensive
interrogation.
US Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and Pakistani investigators
have already been questioning the detainees -- mostly Arabs -- at Kohat
jail in northern Pakistan.
