Chiluba's last parliamentary session to convene this month 
The last parliamentary session of under Zambia's current government led
by President Frederick Chiluba is expected to begin sitting on
September 26, the national assembly said in a statement Friday.
The sitting will be the last before Chiluba dissolves parliament in
preparation for general elections scheduled for October.
The previous session was adjourned in May and had been characterised by
a series of walkouts by members of the opposition parties.
The country's largest opposition movements, the United National
Independence Party (UNIP) and National Party (NP), refused to
contribute to debates on the adoption of the newly-amended
constitution.
Members of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) passed
the controversial constitution amendment bill with no opposition in the
MMD-dominated house.
The Zambian leader assented to the bill in May, making it law despite
massive protest from opposition political parties, the church,
non-governmental organisations and some western donors.
The new constitution bars former Zambian leader Kenneth Kaunda from
contesting the presidency as it limits aspirants to second generation
citizens. Kaunda's parents came to Zambia from neighbouring Malawi at
the turn of the century.
Further, the constitution which limits the president to two mandates,
also bars Kaunda because he has already served more than two terms in
the office.
Chiluba has yet to announce the election date.
