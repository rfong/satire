"We know that miracles can happen and one just did tonight," Diane
Hall, the pilot's mother said on a television interview.
Defense Secretary William Perry issued a statement just minutes after
Hall walked across the demilitarized zone to freedom at 0216 GMT
Friday.
"I can't think of a better New Year's present for the Hall family and
for the men and women of the Department of Defense than this
humanitarian gesture by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,"
Perry said.
The North Koreans had accused Hall of being on a spying mission when
his helicopter went down killing his crewmate David Hilemon. But the
United States rejected the charge. Hilemon's body was flown to the
United States for burial.
Perry said Hall was released after the North Koreans completed their
investigation of the incident when his helicopter "was downed after
straying in North Korean airspace during a training and orientation
mission."
But Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Arnie Owens said the
reference to the aircraft that "was downed" did not necessarily give
credence to the North Korean contention that they shot the OH-58
chopper out of the sky.
"We don't say how it was downed," Owens told AFP. "That we still have
to determine" after talking to Hall.
Owens said Hall, flown by helicopter after his release to Yonsan
military base in Seoul for a medical examination and debriefing, would
fly Friday to MacDill Air Force base near Tampa, Florida.
He said the newly freed airman would land between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.
(2300 and 0000 GMT) and "link up with his family as soon as possible"
in nearby Brooksville.
