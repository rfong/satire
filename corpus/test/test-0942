Pentagon looking to accelerate development of sea-based missile defenses 
Having scored direct hits in its first two tests, a US sea-based
missile defense system may be sufficiently developed by mid-decade to
be used in an emergency, the general in charge of the program said.
Air Force Lieutenant General Ronald Kadish, director of the Missile
Defense Agency, said he expected a decision soon on whether to
accelerate the program, which uses Aegis warships to shoot down
intermediate-range missiles, in light of last week's successful test
interception over the Pacific.
"Given where we have been in some of our flight testing, this is a
great position to be in," Kadish told a gathering at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank that has championed missile
defense.
If accelerated, the sea-based missile defense system would be on as
fast a track to deployment as the system of ground-based interceptors
in Alaska. For years the ground-based interceptors have been the main
focus effort to develop a missile shield capable of defending the
United States.
Clearing the way for faster development of a sea-based system is the
demise of the 1972 ABM treaty on June 15. The treaty restricted
development of a range of missile defense systems, including sea-based
systems.
Kadish showed dramatic infrared imagery from the latest test on June
13, including a closeup of the single stage target missile an instant
before it was obliterated by the warhead of an SM-3 interceptor missile
fired into space from a Navy warship, the USS Lake Erie.
The warship's Aegis radar was used to track and target the missile
after it was fired over the Pacific from Kauai in the Hawaiian islands.
The system also scored a direct hit on its first flight on January 25
even though the goal of was only to gather dfg9
Kadish said the Pentagon had scheduled as many as nine flight tests to
accomplish what it achieved in the first two tests.
"If we have five or ten flight tests scheduled and we can accomplish
our objectives in two or three or four of those flights, we ought to
absolutely capitalize as quickly as possible on that situation where we
didn't have any failures and we had more confidence sooner in the
system than we had expected," he said.
In deciding whether to restructure the testing program, the Pentagon
also would consider how soon test assets that could be used in an
emergency, he said.
"We have the advantage of having successful flight tests behind us and
we can make those decisions soon," he said. "So the time frame of mid-
this decade may become more real for emergency capability."
