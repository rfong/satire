Tokyo stocks close firmer 
Japanese share prices rallied Thursday with the key market barometer
closing 0.8 percent higher on buying by public funds and a late round
of futures-led purchases, brokers said.
"Foreign brokers started buying back the (Nikkei-225 December futures)
contract actively in mid-afternoon trading," a broker at a medium-sized
Japanese securities house said.
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 leading issues rose 166.10 points to
finish at 21,322.85 while the Topix index of all issues on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was up 4.41 points at 1,601.89.
Turnover on the major board totaled an estimated 300 million shares
against the previous day's 403.37 million shares.
In early trading, share prices were pressured by arbitrage selling and
profit-taking following recent advances, brokers said.
The market was pushed down by the dollar's fall in overseas trade
against the yen due to the announcement of a record US trade deficit in
July.
"After opening lower, there was no incentive to buy in the morning
session," said a Japanese brokerage dealer.
Around the 21,000-point line, investment trusts underpinned the market,
brokers said. Buying emerged in selected sectors including autos,
construction contractors and electricals.
The investor sentiment also improved on the back of the dollar's
comeback against the yen to the mid-109 yen level in Tokyo trade, they
added.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by 530-512 while 209 other issues
closed unchanged.
