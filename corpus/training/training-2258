Man Killed Over Lost Quarter in Pay Phone 
A New York man was charged Monday with killing a video store employee
in a rage over losing 25 cents in the store's pay phone.
Manuel Waisome, 36, had demanded his money back Friday night, police
said. An argument broke out, and Waisome allegedly shot Horacio Agosta,
the 29-year-old son of the store owner, in the chest, back and neck,
and fled in his car.
Waisome was arrested Sunday on murder charges.
