Ethnic divide widening in Sri Lanka: analysts
The ethnic divide in Sri Lanka between majority Sinhalese and minority
Tamils has been exacerbated by the military's capture of the former
Tamil rebel citadel of Jaffna, analysts said.
The government's portrayal of its military operation in Jaffna as a
"conquest" and subsequent celebrations in Colombo have further widened
the rift between the two ethnic communities, Tamil politicians and
analysts have said.
The military took Jaffna on December 2 after a ferocious 47-day battle,
driving out the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE),
which had maintained the town as the capital of a de facto state in
northern Sri Lanka.
The victory sparked celebrations among the majority Sinhalese
community.
"(President Chandrika) Kumaratunga has to show she respects Tamil
ethnic identity," said a Tamil analyst at the Centre for Ethnic Studies
here. "She has to play down the conquest image."
A Tamil economist, who did not want to be named, said: "There have been
no efforts at national integration. There has been only disintegration
here. But the process of alienation is still reversible if a concerted
effort is made now."
Kumaratunga unveiled a long-awaited peace package on August 3 that won
her accolades from many, but was criticised by Sinhalese hardliners who
say she was conceding too much to the Tamils in the name of autonomy.
Tamil politicians say Kumaratunga's failure to legislate the package by
winning general consensus was another indication of the clout of the
Sinhalese hardliners.
"Tamils must be satisfied that the package will be implemented
seriously if the government wants to win back the goodwill that existed
during (last year's) presidential elections," said Tamil MP M.
Sivasithamparam.
Said the Tamil economist: "Tamil children born in the eighties are
fighters. A whole new generation -- the children of the children of war
-- have been indoctrinated to think of the Sinhalese as enemies."
Ethnic violence peaked between 1983-1993 and had been on the wane until
April, when talks between the government and the LTTE ended abruptly
after the Tamil Tigers resumed hostilities.
Since then, LTTE guerrillas have carried out a series of attacks around
the island, including the October massacre of 31 Sinhalese in isolated
villages, some 206 kilometers (128 miles) north of Colombo.
The guerrillas were reportedly assisted by Tamil villagers, who were
possibly coerced into pinpointing Sinhalese homes, creating a general
wave of resentment against the local Tamil population.
A political solution has to be sought to the ethnic problem, said
Sivasithamparam, who is president of the moderate Tamil United
Liberation Front (TULF) party.
"After that, we can move to lessen the divide and create ethnic
harmony," he added.
Many Tamils allege they are discriminated against, especially in
government jobs on linguistic grounds. The government has tried to
remove the perception by conciliatory moves, including making Tamil an
official language.
Kumaratunga meanwhile remains under intense pressure to maintain the
military initiative against the LTTE while remaining sensitive to Tamil
feelings.
Analysts stress the need to return the mass of refugees displaced by
the army offensive to their homes in Jaffna at the earliest. "Refugee
camps are breeding grounds for militancy," said an analyst.
"The vast majority of Jaffna residents had to have some dealings with
the LTTE and they may fear army reprisals," the analyst said. "It has
to be made clear that they have nothing to fear."
More than 50,000 people have been killed in the LTTE's protracted
campaign for an independent homeland called Eelam across the country's
north and east.
