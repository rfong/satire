Zairean rebel Kabila says "direct negotiations" are near 
Zairean rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila said Wednesday his movement
was close to "direct negotiations" with the Zairean authorities but
that a ceasefire was still some way off.
"For us, we are ready to have direct negotiations with them," he said
-- referring to the government of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko --
after talks here with President Nelson Mandela.
Asked how close to his rebel movement, which is engaged in a civil war
with Mobutu's forces in eastern Zaire, was to a ceasefire, Kabila
replied: "Not a ceasefire; we are close to negotiations but we haven't
come to a ceasefire yet."
The talks with Mandela, at the president's private home in
Johannesburg, lasted some 90 minutes after which the two men emerged
chatting and laughing to speak briefly to reporters.
