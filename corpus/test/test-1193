Serbs face sanctions unless Karadzic is ousted: conference 
Economic sanctions will be imposed against Bosnian Serbs and Belgrade
unless hardline Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is ousted from power by
July 1, Bosnian Prime Minister Hasan Muratovic said Friday.
"There is very clear request which will be announced now that Karadzic
is out of politics by first of July. Sanctions will be imposed if this
does not happen," Muratovic said following the signing of a joint
statement here at the end of a two-day conference on the Bosnian peace
accords.
The sanctions warning is included in that statement.
"Economic sanctions that were imposed before to Serbia and Republika
Srpska will be reimposed if they don't comply with the conclusions of
this conference," Muratovic said.
