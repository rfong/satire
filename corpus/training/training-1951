Nikko Securities profit soars in first half 
Nikko Securities Co. Ltd. of Japan said Monday its pre-tax profit
soared to 25.5 billion (260 million dollars) in the six months to
September, up from 2.3 billion yen a year earlier.
The country's third-largest securities company said operating income
climbed 19 percent to 139 billion yen in the same period.
Nikko forecast a pre-tax profit of 50 billion yen for the full year on
operating income of 275 billion yen, with the company saying it was
about to emerge from the worst of the downturn in share trading.
Despite low average daily turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during
the first half, the company said it benefitted from an increase in bond
trading profits which jumped to 25.8 billion yen, reversing a loss of
8.9 billion yen. Commission income from bonds rose from 8.8 billion yen
to 14.1 billion yen.
Nikko said profits from dealing in equities declined from 10.9 billion
yen to 1.2 billion although commission income from equities edged up
from 38.7 billion yen to 39.0 billion yen.
The company said it succeeded in promoting further cost-cutting efforts
during the six-month period, reducing sales, general and administration
costs by more than one billion yen.
