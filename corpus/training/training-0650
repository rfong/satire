Official Circular Urges Assistance to The Poor 
China's central authorities today issued a circular asking governments
at all levels to help urban and rural residents who have difficulties
in their living conditions.
The circular, jointly issued by the General Office of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and the General Office of the State
Council, said that those in difficulties are mainly workers of
money-losing firms, of which operations have been suspended fully or
partially, retired workers, people in disaster-hit areas and poor
areas, old ex-servicemen in rural areas, and some aged or disabled
people.
Party Committees and governments at all levels should handle the
problem and spare no efforts to help the poor and needy especially in
the period between the New Year's Day and the Spring Festival, the
circular said.
It urged workers' unions, departments of labor and civil affairs, and
other organizations to work together to help meet basic living demand
of those in difficulty.
Meanwhile, the circular asked all government officials to work hard,
practice frugality, and keep away from extravagancy in arranging
official events.
