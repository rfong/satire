Philippine Central Bank Moves to Lower Lending Rates 
Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said here today that
he would urge commercial banks to lower prime lending rates before the
year-end.
Despite the Central Bank's opening of overnight lending window and the
release of additional liquidity reserves, the Bankers Association of
the Philippines (BAP) failed to lower the prime lending rates to below
20 percent before the end of the year as promised, he said.
He added that he would meet with the members of the BAP Friday to
encourage them to lower the prime lending rates before the end of this
year.
"If this will not happen at the end of this year, I will encourage them
to do it at least during the first week of January 1998," he said.
Singson further explained that some banks intentionally raised the
prime lending rates depending on who wants to borrow loans from banks.
He admitted that there are banks which imposed higher prime lending
rates if they feel that the track-record of a certain borrower is not
good.
According to him, this is their way of saying "no" to clients whom they
cannot turn away. But to those who are good creditors, they would
simply give them a lower interest rate on borrowings.
However, Singson discounted rumors that the liquidity of some banks was
affected because some big borrowers were not able to repay their loans
due to the prevailing currency crisis.
