Mourning Illness Clouds Heat's Title Hopes 
Miami center Alonzo Mourning is out indefinitely with a kidney
disorder, putting the Heat's championship dreams on hold.
Mourning's condition, which was detected during a preseason physical
examination, could be anything from a viral infection, a thyroid
condition or fatigue, Heat officials said.
"Some things popped up on his physical and blood tests that were not
normal," coach Pat Riley said, "We're concerned about it. "
A Heat spokesman said no further statement would be made regarding
Mourning's condition until more information is available.
Mourning, 30, who helped lead the United States to the gold medal at
the Sydney Olympics after a two-point win over Lithuania in the
semifinals, is expected to have further tests.
Beginning on August 23, Mourning was on the road with the U.S. Olympic
basketball team for nearly six weeks, logging more than 40, 000 air
miles. He crossed the Pacific Ocean four times, returning briefly to
Miami for the birth of his second child, then flew back to Sydney.
