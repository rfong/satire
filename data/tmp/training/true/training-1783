Israel/NNP Says/VBZ It/PRP Wo/MD n't/RB Confiscate/VB More/JJR Land/NN in/IN East/NNP Jerusalem/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Yitzhak/NNP Rabin/NNP ,/, trying/VBG to/TO defuse/VB the/DT latest/JJS crisis/NN threatening/VBG Israeli-Palestinian/JJ peace/NN talks/NNS ,/, promised/VBD Sunday/NNP that/IN Israel/NNP would/MD not/RB confiscate/VB any/DT more/JJR Arab/JJ land/NN in/IN Jerusalem/NNP ./.

The/DT government/NN refused/VBD ,/, however/RB ,/, to/TO back/VB down/RP on/IN plans/NNS to/TO confiscate/VB 140/CD acres/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 57/CD hectares/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- of/IN mostly/RB Arab-owned/JJ land/NN in/IN the/DT contested/VBN eastern/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT city/NN to/TO build/VB more/JJR housing/NN for/IN Jews/NNPS and/CC a/DT police/NN station/NN ./.

Marwan/NNP Kanafani/NNP ,/, spokesman/NN for/IN PLO/NNP leader/NN Yasser/NNP Arafat/NNP ,/, called/VBD that/DT refusal/NN ``/`` a/DT blow/NN to/TO the/DT peace/NN process/NN that/WDT will/MD strengthen/VB the/DT position/NN of/IN the/DT enemies/NNS of/IN peace/NN on/IN both/DT sides/NNS ./. ''/''

The/DT Palestinian/JJ minister/NN in/IN charge/NN of/IN Jerusalem/NNP affairs/NNS ,/, Faisal/NNP Husseini/NNP ,/, said/VBD Rabin/NNP 's/POS pledge/NN not/RB to/TO seize/VB more/JJR land/NN in/IN Jerusalem/NNP was/VBD meaningless/JJ because/IN Israel/NNP had/VBD already/RB confiscated/VBN so/RB much/RB ./.

The/DT Arab/NNP League/NNP called/VBD the/DT decision/NN ``/`` worthless/JJ ./. ''/''

Israel/NNP last/JJ month/NN announced/VBD plans/NNS to/TO confiscate/VB land/NN in/IN east/NNP Jerusalem/NNP ,/, which/WDT the/DT Palestinians/NNPS want/VBP as/IN the/DT capital/NN of/IN their/PRP$ would-be/JJ state/NN ./.

Palestinians/NNPS said/VBD the/DT seizure/NN could/MD be/VB the/DT final/JJ blow/NN to/TO already/RB teetering/VBG peace/NN talks/NNS with/IN Israel/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT move/NN drew/VBD international/JJ condemnation/NN ./.

The/DT confiscation/NN plan/NN was/VBD approved/VBN at/IN the/DT weekly/JJ Cabinet/NNP meeting/NN Sunday/NNP despite/IN opposition/NN from/IN the/DT Meretz/NNP party/NN ,/, the/DT left-wing/JJ coalition/NN partner/NN of/IN Rabin/NNP 's/POS Labor/NNP party/NN ./.

But/CC Rabin/NNP ``/`` stated/VBD very/RB clearly/RB that/IN there/EX will/MD be/VB no/DT new/JJ confiscation/NN of/IN land/NN in/IN Jerusalem/NNP for/IN building/NN purposes/NNS ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Environment/NNP Minister/NNP Yossi/NNP Sarid/NNP of/IN the/DT Meretz/NNP party/NN ./.

The/DT government/NN could/MD still/RB confiscate/VB land/NN for/IN roads/NNS or/CC other/JJ public/JJ works/NNS ,/, ministers/NNS said/VBD ./.

Rabin/NNP emphasized/VBD that/IN the/DT confiscation/NN can/MD still/RB be/VB appealed/VBN by/IN landowners/NNS ,/, said/VBD Education/NNP Minister/NNP Amnon/NNP Rubinstein/NNP ,/, also/RB of/IN Meretz/NNP ./.

If/IN those/DT appeals/NNS drag/VBP on/IN past/JJ 1996/CD ,/, when/WRB talks/NNS on/IN the/DT final/JJ status/NN of/IN Jerusalem/NNP are/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO start/VB ,/, the/DT issue/NN could/MD become/VB moot/NN ./.

Rabin/NNP said/VBD the/DT government/NN ,/, in/IN coordination/NN with/IN city/NN officials/NNS ,/, would/MD also/RB look/VB for/IN ways/NNS to/TO give/VB more/JJR building/NN permits/NNS to/TO Arabs/NNPS in/IN Jerusalem/NNP ./.

Under/IN Israeli/JJ zoning/VBG laws/NNS ,/, Arabs/NNPS are/VBP not/RB allowed/VBN to/TO build/VB on/IN more/JJR than/IN half/PDT of/IN the/DT land/NN Israel/NNP annexed/VBN after/IN capturing/VBG east/JJ Jerusalem/NNP in/IN the/DT 1967/CD Mideast/JJ war/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP 405,000/NNP Jews/NNPS and/CC 155,000/NNP Palestinians/NNPS living/NN in/IN Jerusalem/NNP ./.

Virtually/RB all/PDT the/DT Palestinians/JJ live/VBP in/IN east/JJ Jerusalem/NNP ,/, where/WRB today/NN they/PRP make/VBP up/RB just/RB under/IN half/PDT the/DT population/NN ./.

Sunday/NNP 's/POS decision/NN appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT compromise/NN aimed/VBN at/IN ending/VBG international/JJ criticism/NN of/IN Israel/NNP over/IN Jerusalem/NNP ,/, the/DT most/RBS explosive/JJ issue/NN in/IN the/DT Israeli-Palestinian/JJ negotiations/NNS ./.

Israel/NNP insists/VBZ the/DT city/NN ,/, with/IN sites/NNS holy/VBN to/TO Jews/NNPS ,/, Muslims/NNPS and/CC Christians/NNPS ,/, must/MD never/RB be/VB divided/VBN again/RB ./.

Environment/NNP Minister/NNP Sarid/NNP underscored/VBD that/DT point/NN ,/, saying/VBG it/PRP was/VBD in/IN Israel/NNP 's/POS own/JJ interest/NN to/TO treat/VB Arab/JJ residents/NNS of/IN the/DT city/NN more/RBR fairly/RB ./.

``/`` Otherwise/RB our/PRP$ chances/NNS to/TO maintain/VB sovereignty/NN over/IN Jerusalem/NNP are/VBP very/RB ,/, very/RB slim/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

The/DT Cabinet/NNP decision/NN was/VBD attacked/VBN by/IN Jerusalem/NNP Mayor/NNP Ehud/NNP Olmert/NNP ,/, who/WP rejected/VBD the/DT suggestion/NN that/IN the/DT city/NN could/MD expand/VB toward/IN the/DT west/NN instead/RB of/IN the/DT east/JJ ./.

Husseini/NNP said/VBD Sunday/NNP 's/POS resolution/NN would/MD make/VB no/DT difference/NN to/TO Palestinians/NNPS ./.

``/`` It/PRP is/VBZ only/JJ words/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP told/VBD The/DT Associated/NNP Press/NNP ./.
