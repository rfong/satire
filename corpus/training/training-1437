New Passenger Car Emissions Down: EU Report 
Carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars sold in the European
Union (EU) dropped by 5.6 percent between 1995 and 1999, a unionwide
report said on Friday.
The reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars was
achieved through a program that aims at reducing average carbon dioxide
emissions for new passenger cars to 140 grams per kilometer by 2005 or
2010 at the latest.
The program is part of an EU strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emission
from passenger cars and improve motor vehicle fuel economy.
EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom said the downward trend
had shown that the automobile industry is increasingly willing and
ready to play an active part in protecting the environment and that
tangible and rapid results can be promoted through voluntary agreements
with stakeholders.
The EU strategy consists of environmental accords with European,
Japanese and South Korean auto makers. The EU annual report said that
auto makers from Europe, Japan and South Korea all delivered a
reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from their new passenger cars, by
6.0 percent, 4.6 percent and 1.5 percent respectively.
But the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, said that
auto makers in Europe, Japan and South Korea must all increase their
efforts so as to meet the final target as set in the EU strategy.
The annual report, compiled by the commission, was expected to serve to
strengthen EU determination to fight traffic-related air pollution
through the best environmental technology available, commission
officials said.
