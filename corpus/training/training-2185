Indonesian president leaves North Korea after landmark trip 
Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri left North Korea early
Saturday after urging Pyongyang to renew talks with the rival South,
reports said.
She was seen off at the airport by a large crowd of people after
reviewing a guard of honour with Kim Yong Nam, the head of the North
Korean parliament and its nominal head of state, the official Korean
Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
She was heading for Seoul to brief the South Korean leadership on her
meetings with the North Korean leadership.
On Friday she met with the country's secretive leader Kim Jong-Il for
one hour at the Paekhwawon state guest house in Pyongyang, according to
Indonesia's state news agency Antara.
Antara said no ministers in the Indonesian delegation were present and
no details of the talks were given.
The North's official media confirmed the two had met saying Kim spoke
with Megawati "in a cordial and friendly atmosphere."
Megawati was the first foreign leader to meet Kim since North Korea was
condemned for being part of "an axis of evil" by US President George W.
Bush in January. Pyongyang-Washington tensions have since ritj !
At a dinner on Thursday night, Megawati called on North Korea to open
new talks with South Korea, saying peace would benefit the two Koreas
and the whole Asia-Pacific region.
"Our concern is how this region can maintain brotherhood despite the
crisis," Megawati said at the dinner hosted by Kim Yong Nam.
