Hrawi backs anti-Israeli resistance, vows Syria coordination 
President Elias Hrawi, fresh into a three-year extension of his term,
pledged his support on Friday for the anti-Israeli resistance in
southern Lebanon.
"The liberation of south Lebanon from the Israeli occupier is a
national priority and the resistance to this occupation will go on
until their withdrawal," he said in an address to the nation.
Six Israeli soldiers were killed last Sunday in an attack on an
occupied border zone by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas.
The president also vowed that Lebanon would not break ranks from Syria
in the Arab-Israeli peace process, "despite Israeli pressure to
disassociate the two tracks."
The Lebanese-Israeli track is on hold until progress has been made in
Syria's negotiations with the Jewish state that have themselves been
stalled for several months.
Lebanon's "strategic" decision is to cooperate and coordinate with
Syria, Hrawi said.
The Lebanese parliament on Thursday voted to change the constitution,
allowing Hrawi -- who in November would have served out his six-year
term -- to stay on for another three years.
Hrawi is a close ally of Syria in Lebanon, where Damascus is the main
power-broker and deploys 35,000 troops.
He vowed in his address, which was broadcast on radio and television,
to push ahead with the reconstruction programme launched after
Lebanon's 1975-1990 war and to draw up a new electoral law.
