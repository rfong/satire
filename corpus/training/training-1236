Ramos Reiterates Mandate Against Private Army 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos today reiterated his order to
dismantle private armed groups.
In a statement, Ramos said that token surrenders by leaders of private
armed groups were unacceptable.
"If they fail to comply, appropriate police and legal actions will be
mounted against them," he noted.
The president also stressed that his directive covered private armed
groups whether contained in the list submitted to the Commission on
Elections or related to the previous drive against private army by the
Department of Interior and Local Government.
According to the president, warlordism had no place in a democratic
society pursuing total development within a regime of justice, equity
and peace.
