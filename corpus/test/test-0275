14 Killed in Ambush in Northern Philippines 
Fourteen persons, including an Army colonel, were killed Tuesday
afternoon by suspected leftist rebels in Isabela province in the
northern Philippines while on the way to their camp from a medical
mission, a TV report said Wednesday.
According to the ABS-CBN television, Colonel Josefino Manayao,
commander of the fifth Infantry Division's 502nd Infantry Brigade, was
heading the convoy when a group of armed men sprayed with bullets the
tail-end of the troop's military truck around 2 p.m. Tuesday.
Manayao tried to retaliate but was immediately hit by the ambushers,
said the report. Landmines planted by the rebels also caught the
soldiers by surprise.
The military refused to divulge the names of the other victims which
include civilians caught in the crossfire, said the report.
