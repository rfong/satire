Qatar minister dismisses Bahrain clemency for Qatari "spies" 
Qatar's foreign minister Sheikh Hamad ben Jassim ben Jabr al-Thani
dismissed late Saturday the significance of an amnesty by Bahrain of
two Qataris jailed for spying.
"This is a play which is now over," he told journalists in Cairo, where
he is attending a meeting of Arab nations focussing on ways to resolve
a territorial dispute between member states Bahrain and Qatar.
Hours before the two-day meeting was set to open here the emir of
Bahrain granted a pardon to the two Qataris convicted of espionage last
week and sentenced to three years in prison.
Bahrain said the move was aimed at underscoring Sheikh Issa bin Salman
al-Khalifa's "desire to maintain privileged and brotherly relations
between the peoples of Bahrain and Qatar."
Qatar had denied the men were spies and called for their immediate
release.
Commenting on his Qatari counterpart's stance, Bahraini Foreign
Minister Sheikh Mohammad ben Mubarak al-Khalifa said the pardon was "a
good gesture which aims to put an end to this incident, and which
illustrates the strength of the fraternal links between the two
peoples."
Doha and Manama are locked in a dispute involving the Hawar Islands in
the Gulf, held by Bahrain, which also claims control over the Zubara
coastal region in northwest Qatar.
Qatar unilaterally took up the issue with the International Court of
Justice at The Hague, triggering protests from Bahrain but in September
Manama agreed to argue its case at the international court.
The weekend meeting here brings together the signatories of the
Damascus Declaration, comprising the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council, of which Bahrain and Qatar are both members, Egypt and Syria.
The Damascus Declaration group was set up in 1991 after the Gulf war to
bolster the security and economic position of the eight countries.
