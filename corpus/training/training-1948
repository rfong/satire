China warns against outside interference in Serbia 
China echoed Russia Thursday by warning against outside interference in
the standoff between the opposition and supporters of Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic.
"We are paying close attention to the developments" in Belgrade, said
foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang.
"But the local elections are purely an internal affair of (Federal)
Yugoslavia and we hope that they can come to a proper settlement on the
issue," he added.
Fifty-eight people were hurt, five of them seriously, in clashes
between rival opposition and government supporters in Belgrade Tuesday.
The rally, the first pro-government demonstration organised in Belgrade
recently, was held at the same time and place as the regular opposition
protests in the capital.
Demonstrators have been protesting for almost six weeks against the
cancellation of sweeping victories by the opposition Together coalition
in 15 of Serbia's 18 largest towns, including Belgrade, in November 17
municipal elections.
The Russian parliament Wednesday denounced all outside pressure on
Serbia, which forms half of the Yugoslav Federation, saying the issue
was a "domestic affair."
But the United States Tuesday said it held Milosevic and the Serbian
government responsible for the violence in Belgrade.
