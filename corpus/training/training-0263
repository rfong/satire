In Copenhagen, British Foreign Office Minister David Davis said he
hoped an agreement could be struck before the Florence summit because
"after Florence, it will get more difficult for everybody."
During a brief visit to the Danish capital accompanied by deputy
Agriculture Minister Tony Baldry, he said: "We hope that the others
European countries will listen to our arguments and take a rational
decision before the European summit in Florence."
Baldry, who met his Danish counterpart Henrik Dam Kristensen, added:
"We are asking for a road map not a time table."
