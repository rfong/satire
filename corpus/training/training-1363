Fart to Gold in London 2012
Olympic Chiefs have decided to include Farting into the London 2012
Olympic Games.
The Olympic Panel Committee agreed unanimously that if they were going
to have silly events like Gymnastic Ribbon Twirling & Synchronized
Swimming in the Olympics, then Farting is a viable option.
The event will include many different disciplines of Farting: Men's,
Women's and mixed doubles catagories. 3 judges will award points for
Odour, pitch, tone and style of delivery. A shit is immediately
disqualified. Each competitor will be randomly tested for banned
substances such as: Sprouts, Curry, Chilli, Bombay Mix and Baked Beans.
Each Farter will also be inspected by a qualified Proctologist to
ensure there has been no surgical enhancement. Each competitor will
mount the Farting Podium, grip the pole and will have 60 seconds to
perform. There are several Catagories: Freestyle, Power Endurance,
Synchronized Formation, Squat-thrust, Power Blast & Marathon.
6 times UK Champion, Archibald 'The Trumpet' Griswald is thrilled, he
said "it'll be fantastic to represent Great Britain in 2012. Efforts
must be doubled and i'm gonna practice 'til I prolapse! And it'll be
nice to be around people again, I have so few friends you see".
Griswald's closest nemesis is likely to be Helmet Trumpzenburger,
nicknamed 'The Cologne Colon'. He is expected to make a full recovery
from Rectal surgery after severely ripping himself in the recent German
National Championships whilst delivering a squeaker/rasper combination
in the final fart-off. He has already started full training on a
combination of mushy peas, Sauerkraut, Frankfurters and Dr Pepper.
Seb Coe, who himself is known to be quite handy in the trouser
department and regularly 'turns out' for his local pub team, has
welcomed the news. "It's going to be a tremendous spectacle", said Lord
Coe "I've already booked The Gas Club in Croydon. We will need to
improve the ventilation though"
