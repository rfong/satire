Gatting Completes Double Century 
Pugnacious veteran batsman Mike Gatting completed a double century
Sunday as England moved into a strong position after the second day of
its four-day cricket match against Queensland at Heritage Park.
Gatting scored 203 not out and staked a strong claim for a place in the
team to face England in the second Test from Dec.24 with a confident
performance as the tourists made 507-6 declared in their first innings.
It was England's highest total on tour and the first time it had scored
more than 400 runs. Gatting recorded his 83rd first-class century.
Strike bowler Devon Malcolm then gave England more reason for cheer
when he opened the bowling and dismissed Queensland openers Matthew
Hayden (8) and Trevor Barsby (15).
Queensland was 197-4 at stumps after Stuart Law made an authorative 91
before being caught in the deep by Angus Fraser.
Jimmy Maher (22) and Andrew Symonds (4) were the last of the recognized
batsmen and will resume on Monday morning.
Gatting was denied his personal celebration when he was smacked in the
jaw two overs into the Queensland first innings.
He leant low and forward to make a regulation stop in the covers from
Queensland opener Trevor Barsby, but the ball reared and crashed into
his face.
He fell to the ground as his teammates rushed to his aid. He left the
field for treatment and did not return.
Gatting was later reported to have suffered a lacerated mouth and a
bruised jaw. His innings had earlier lasted almost eight hours and 345
balls.
Alec Stewart was unbeaten on 53 at the declaration after he and Gatting
added 145 in an unbroken stand.
