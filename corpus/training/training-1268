Meeting on Great Lakes to Be Held in Kenya 
The German government is scheduled to hold a three-day meeting in
Nairobi to seek possible solutions to problems in the Great Lakes
region, the Daily Nation reported Saturday.
The paper said the meeting starting from Monday would be chaired by
German Vice-Foreign Minister Wemer Hoyer and German ambassadors from
the Lakes region and four Members of Parliament would attend the
meeting.
German Ambassador to Kenya Michael Gerdts was quoted as saying Friday
that "the conference will be looking for the ideal intervention --
either advisory, political and (or) specific projects -- which our
country and the international community could make to create peace in
the region."
The ambassador noted that the Great Lakes region was "of great concern
to Africa and the international community, adding that "all may seem
quiet now in Rwanda, Burundi and former Zaire, but the possible
resurgence of another genocide must be stopped at all costs."
He disclosed that participants of the meeting would meet Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi and Kenyan government ministers for "official
talks".
