OSCE chief sees problems three weeks ahead of Bosnia polls
Preparations for Bosnia's first post-war elections next month are
falling short of the mark with more progress needed in key areas, the
head of the organisation overseeing the poll said Tuesday.
"I have a most central concern three weeks before the elections, and
this concern is the question of the free movement of persons" around
Bosnia, Flavio Cotti, chairman of the Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said.
Guaranteeing freedom of movement between the Moslem-Croat federation
and the Republika Srpska which make up Bosnia, was "the main condition"
for free and fair elections set for September 14, said Cotti.
"More progress will have to be made" he said here after a brief meeting
with Kresimir Zubak, president of Moslem-Croat federation.
The OSCE chief's concern comes after a spate of criticism of the
decision to press ahead with the elections in Bosnia which are vital to
the future of the Dayton peace accords.
Last week, the International Crisis Group, monitoring implementation of
the Dayton peace accords called for the elections to be postponed.
It cited the fact that indicted war criminals are still at large, that
freedom of movement is restricted, notably in the Republika Srpska,
that media access is denied and that abuses of the voter registration
were widespread.
An OSCE official said Monday that the body was considering erecting
polling stations on the former frontline because of fears for Moslems
crossing into Serb territory.
The option, one of two being considered for Moslems and Croats who want
to vote in Serb-held territory, was being discussed because of fears
that hardline Bosnian Serb nationalists would disrupt attempts by
Moslems and Croats to vote, said Jeff Fischer, OSCE director general
for the Bosnian elections.
Under the Dayton peace accords for Bosnia refugees can vote in
territories where they used to live in 1991, before war broke out in
Bosnia.
Former Bosnian premier Haris Silajdzic, viewed as a proponent of ethnic
unity in Bosnia, has said meanwhile he favours boycotting the elections
which he said would be "neither fair, nor democratic".
Speaking on a tour of Scandinavian countries, home to many Bosnian
refugees due to vote in the September 14 poll, Silajdzic said Monday:
"It's a mystery to me why the world is backing this electoral process,
which is neither fair nor democratic." The poll would serve only to
"legitimise ethnic cleansing," he said.
UN authorities have meanwhile in recent days raised concerns about
harassment of opposition politicians, notably in the Bihac region of
northern Bosnia after a series of attacks on opposition supporters in
the region.
Bihac, a small town that came under a cruel siege by Bosnian and
Croatian Serbs and a small group of Moslem rebels for most of the
1992-1995 Bosnian war, is now firmly in the grip of the ruling Moslem
Party of Democratic Action (SDA).
The head of the OSCE mission in Bosnia, Robert Frowick, on Monday,
himself warned the OSCE might invalidate the elections in certain areas
if local officials fail to comply with the Dayton peace accord.
He cited ten towns of particular concern, five in the Moslem-Croat
federation and five the Republika Srpska.
