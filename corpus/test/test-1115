"In such a situation secular forces must see that the BJP does not succeed
in forming a government," Karat said. "The people have not given an
opportunity to the BJP. Now efforts must be made to have a secular
government in Lucknow."
Sources in the Congress and the United Front said top level separate
meetings were being planned shortly to discuss future strategy in the
event of a fractured assemby.
Prime Minister Deve Gowda's confidant, federal Defence Minister Mulayam
Singh Yadav -- a former Uttar Pradesh chief minister -- will form a
crucial part in the United Front's policy towards the state, experts
said.
Yadav is vehemently opposed to Mayavati (Eds : one word), a lower caste
Hindu woman who replaced him as chief minister after withdrawing
crucial legislative support. The BSP says it will only accept her as
chief minister.
Most pre-poll opinion surveys predicted the BJP would be the biggest
single party in the Uttar Pradesh legislature, even if it did not
manage an outright majority.
The BJP ruled Uttar Pradesh from 1990 until its government was sacked
by New Delhi in 1992 for failing to prevent the destruction of a mosque
by Hindu zealots -- a tragedy which sparked nationwide religious
violence and severely dented India's secular credentials.
The state ballot is the first political trial of strength in India
between the major parties since a short-lived BJP government, formed in
New Delhi in May after the general elections, collapsed after failing
to secure a majority.
A total of 6,000 candidates, mainly independents, fought the Uttar
elections, in which more than half the state's 100 million electorate
voted. Counting of the votes began Wednesday in 419 constituencies.
Polling for six seats has not yet been held.
