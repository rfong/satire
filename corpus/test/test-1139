France to send special envoy to South Korea to discuss jet contract 
A special French government envoy will arrive here Monday to promote a
French contender in the race to win a multi-billion-dollar South Korean
fighter jet contract, reports said.
Jean Bernard Ouvrieu will meet with South Korean Defense Minister Kim
Dong-Shin, a South Korean defense ministry official said Saturday.
French company Dassault and Boeing, of the United States, are
considered the leading contenders for the contract to supply 40 fighter
jets to South Korea.
But the process has become mired in controversy, amid allegations of
South Korean bias towards Boeing and the publication of military
secrets linked to the deal.
Yonhap news agency said Ouvrieu, who was French ambassador to Seoul
between 1985 and 1987, was expected to deliver French Defense Minister
Alain Richard's position on the contract negotiations.
Media reports have said the project's budget, initially set at`&AMP;
h.2 trillion won (3.2 billion dollars), was expected to go beyond five
trillion won.
Boeing has entered the F-15K, the latest version of its F-15 fighter
which is now coming toward the end of its production life. Dassault is
seeking a first foreign customer for its new Rafale fighter.
The other bidders are the Eurofighter consortium -- made up of
companies from Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain -- with its new
Typhoon 2000 and the Su-32, made by Sukhoi of Russia.
One leaked military report said South Korean air force evaluators had
given the Rafale top marks.
But an air force colonel has been detained after telling two television
stations this week that the defence ministry was pressing Boeing's
case, despite the evaluation.
Some South Korean lawmakers have made the same accusation in the
national assembly and protests took place outside the defence ministry
calling for a fair choice.
The South Korean defence ministry was forced to defend its selection
process, saying it was not biased towards any company.
