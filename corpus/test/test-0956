EU criticises Belarus for refusing visa to top OSCE official 
The European Union criticised Belarus on Wednesday for its attitude to
the pan-European OSCE security body after a senior official was forced
to leave when his visa was not renewed.
A statement from the EU presidency, currently held by Spain, said that
it "deeply regrets" the Belarus decision, and said it thought the OSCE
had a fundamental role to play in the former Soviet republic.
"The European Union negatively views this decision which is in line
with the lack, for the time being, of a positive attitude from
Belarus's authorities," the EU statement says.
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was
initially set up as a point of contact between NATO and Warsaw Pact
countries.
It has since evolved into a 55 country organisation mainly concerned
with safeguarding human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
"The European Union underlines the essential importance attached to the
role played by the OSCE with regard to Belaruss democratic
consolidation and economic and social progress," said the EU statement.
"Therefore, it urges Belarussian authorities to accept the new Advisory
and Monitoring Group head and to remove the obstacles hindering the
normal development of relations between Belarus and the OSCE."
On Tuesday the OSCE recalled one of its two remaining diplomats in
Belarus and said its mission in Minsk could no longer work effectively
because of the attitude of the Belarus authorities. Belarus'
authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has come in for strong
criticism from the international community, who charge him with
undermining democracy.
The OSCE said Tuesday it was "no longer in a position to perform its
duties" after the Minsk mission's number three and acting head, British
diplomat Andrew Carpenter, had his diplomatic accreditation withdrawn
from midnight Monday.
He followed the mission's second in command, Frenchman Michel
Rivollier, who was expelled on April 15 after Belarus refused to renew
his visa, and Hans-Georg Wieck, the former German OSCE mission head in
Minsk who left the Belarus capital last December after being repeatedly
accused of supporting the opposition.
Lukashenko's government has persistently refused to accredit the
mission's designated new chief, German diplomat Eberhard Heyken.
It has accused the OSCE of supporting the Belarus opposition.
