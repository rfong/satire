Webb tries to spin a happy ending
Filipino guard Jason Webb, 21, must blot out thoughts of family tragedy
to concentrate on defending the Philippines' basketball crown at the
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games here. The Philippines play their opening
match against Singapore Sunday.
Webb's older brother Hubert is in jail perhaps for life on charges of
three murders and a rape he says he did not commit.
Hubert Webb, 25, and six other men are accused of raping a woman in
mid-1993 and murdering her along with her mother and a younger sister.
His father, Senator Freddie Webb, himself a former amateur basketball
star, and other family members have faced verbal abuse. Jason Webb gets
catcalls when he plays in both the amateur Philippine Basketball league
and in the Universities Athletic Association of the Philippines league.
"It doesn't bother me anymore," Jason Webb told AFP. "I've learned to
live with the abuse."
Only the basketball gold will satisfy the hoop-crazy nation.
"Filipinos can accept defeat in Chiang Mai, but not in basketball,"
said the Philippine Inquirer newspaper. "That would be unforgiveable."
Making the task more difficult is the fact that many of the country's
best players have migrated to the Philippine Basketball Association
professional league and are wary of playing for the national team for
fear of picking up injuries that could invalidate million-dollar
contracts.
Coach Joe Lipa has cobbled together a team of college players that has
been through a crash diet of tough matches abroad against seven clubs
in China and South Korea.
"We have a great team," Lipa said. "Our main problem will be
ourselves."
The inexperienced team's median age is 22. But they use their youthful
energy to mount a blinding motion offense and tough man-to-man defense.
The team's star is Marlou Aquino, a 6ft 9in. (2.06-meter) beanpole. At
23, he is the oldest on the team and will become a millionaire when he
turns pro next month.
Malaysia and Indonesia cannot be counted out in the seven-team field,
but the Filipinos' chief rival will be Thailand, said Indonesian
trainer Hermansyah Bambang.
Thai coach Channarong Piyawongpipul is still smarting from a five-point
loss to a similar young Filipino pick-up team two years ago in the
Singapore SEA Games final.
"The key to beating them is speed," said Channarong, who hopes the
home-court advantage will be enough to win this time.
