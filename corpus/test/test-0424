Asian exodus from UAE expected to total more than 200,000 people
Illegal Asian migrants were still leaving the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) as the end of the government-granted amnesty drawns near, but the
flood has dwindled to a stream, travel agents said on Friday.
More than 150,000 illegal migrants from India and six other South Asian
nations have departed over the past two months and the figure is set to
exceed 200,000 by the end of October, agents and officials said.
The deportees, most of whom sneaked in by sea over the past two
decades, are taking advantage of a limited amnesty to escape long years
in jail and heavy fines mandated by new migration laws that went into
effect on October 1.
"They are still coming in groups to buy tickets but the rush has
largely eased over the past few days," travel agent, Mahmud Mahri, told
AFP.
Nearly half of those who have left were from India and Bangladesh while
the others were from Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, the Philippines and
Sri Lanka.
Most of them entered the UAE illegally by boat from Iran, tempted by
the UAE's massive oil wealth, poorly-guarded shores, and formerly
lenient penalties.
Under the old laws, illegal aliens who were caught were subjected to a
few weeks in prison and deportation. Boat owners who smuggled illegal
migrants in were fined.
The new, stricter law prescribes three years imprisonment and a fine of
up to 30,000 dirhams (8,174 dollars) for illegal migrants.
Boat owners, blamed for the surge in illegal aliens, face up to 15
years in jail and a fine of 15,000-100,000 dirhams (4,087-27,247
dollars).
Officials said they hoped the new law will deter Asians who see a job
in the UAE as the way out of poverty.
Authorities also said they would intensify patrols in the territorial
waters and deploy more radar along the coastline.
"With such measures and penalties, those who try to enter the country
illegally will now think twice," a security source said.
"It is time to get tough with these people as they have created
disorder in the labour market and many of them were engaged in crime.
Our doors will remain open and anybody could come to the UAE but
through legal means."
Asians here illegally and those whose residency permits have expired
have until the end of October to go home or risk prosecution. The
amnesty was extended until then as embassies and travel agents
complained they could not process before October 31 all the people
trying to get out.
