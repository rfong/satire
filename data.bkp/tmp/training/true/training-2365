After/IN their/PRP$ fourth/JJ meeting/NN since/IN Bush/NNP took/VBD over/IN the/DT White/NNP House/NNP a/DT year/NN ago/IN ,/, late/RB on/IN Thursday/NNP ,/, the/DT two/CD leaders/NNS emerged/VBD with/IN different/JJ views/NNS on/IN how/WRB the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP peace/NN process/NN should/MD evolve/VB ./.

For/IN Sharon/NNP ,/, Arafat/NNP ``/`` is/VBZ not/RB and/CC never/RB will/MD be/VB a/DT partner/NN ./.

He/PRP 's/VBZ out/RB of/IN play/VB ,/, ''/'' The/DT prime/JJ minister/NN called/VBN for/IN an/DT ``/`` alternative/JJ Palestinian/NN leadership/NN ./. ''/''

Bush/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, agreed/VBD on/IN keeping/VBG Arafat/NNP under/IN pressure/NN ,/, but/CC stopped/VBD short/JJ of/IN questioning/VBG his/PRP$ credentials/NNS as/IN the/DT representative/NN of/IN the/DT Palestinian/JJ people/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PRP assured/VBD the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN that/IN we/PRP would/MD continue/VB to/TO keep/VB pressure/NN on/IN Mr./NNP Arafat/NNP to/TO convince/VB him/PRP that/IN he/PRP must/MD take/VB serious/JJ ,/, concrete/NN ,/, real/JJ steps/NNS to/TO reduce/VB terrorist/JJ activities/NNS in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP ,/, ''/'' Bush/NNP said/VBD during/IN a/DT joint/JJ press/NN conference/NN after/IN his/PRP$ meeting/NN with/IN Sharon/NNP ./.

Before/IN the/DT meeting/NN ,/, White/NNP House/NNP spokesman/NN Ari/NNP Fleischer/NNP said/VBD Bush/NNP would/MD ``/`` make/VB clear/JJ that/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS will/MD remain/VB engaged/VBN in/IN the/DT region/NN and/CC remain/VB engaged/VBN with/IN the/DT Palestinian/JJ Authority/NNP ''/'' headed/VBN by/IN Arafat/NNP ./.

But/CC Sharon/NNP repeated/VBD his/PRP$ views/NNS at/IN a/DT press/NN conference/NN after/IN his/PRP$ meetings/NNS with/IN Bush/NNP and/CC Vice/NNP President/NNP Dick/NNP Cheney/NNP ./.

``/`` More/JJR pressure/NN must/MD be/VB put/VBN on/IN Arafat/NNP ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` because/IN it/PRP can/MD accelerate/VB the/DT emergence/NN of/IN an/DT alternative/JJ leadership/NN ,/, because/IN Arafat/NNP is/VBZ directly/RB responsible/JJ for/IN the/DT suffering/NN of/IN the/DT Palestinian/JJ population/NN ./.

``/`` This/DT process/NN will/MD take/VB a/DT while/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT longer/JJR Yasser/NNP Arafat/NNP remains/VBZ out/RB of/IN play/VB the/DT quicker/JJR it/PRP will/MD take/VB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP stressed/VBD ,/, suggesting/VBG that/IN the/DT Palestinian/JJ leader/NN should/MD be/VB circumvented/VBN ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO speak/VB with/IN other/JJ Palestinians/NNPS like/IN I/PRP have/VBP done/VBN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Sharon/NNP ,/, referring/VBG to/TO his/PRP$ first/JJ meeting/NN Wednesday/NNP with/IN three/CD top/JJ Palestinian/JJ officials/NNS ,/, including/VBG Palestine/NNP Legislative/NNP Council/NNP president/NN Ahmad/NNP Qorei/NNP and/CC the/DT PLO/NNP 's/POS number/NN two/CD leader/NN ,/, Mahmud/NNP Abbas/NNP ./.

``/`` These/DT Palestinians/NNPS requested/VBD that/IN I/PRP meet/VBP with/IN them/PRP again/RB on/IN my/PRP$ return/NN from/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Sharon/NNP ,/, adding/VBG :/: ``/`` I/PRP 've/VBP accepted/VBN it/PRP as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT pressure/NN that/WDT must/MD be/VB exerted/VBN on/IN Arafat/NNP ./.

Sharon/NNP said/VBD Israel/NNP ``/`` has/VBZ no/DT intention/NN of/IN getting/VBG physical/JJ with/IN Yasser/NNP Arafat/NNP ,/, ''/'' but/CC stressed/VBD that/IN the/DT Israeli/JJ army/NN would/MD continue/VB to/TO keep/VB Arafat/NNP under/IN virtual/JJ house/NN arrest/NN in/IN the/DT West/NNP Bank/NNP town/NN of/IN Ramallah/NNP ,/, where/WRB Israeli/JJ tanks/NNS surround/VBP his/PRP$ headquarters/NN day/NN and/CC night/NN ./.

On/IN that/DT issue/NN ,/, the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN said/VBD ,/, ``/`` there/EX was/VBD no/DT criticism/NN from/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./. ''/''

However/RB ,/, Israeli/NNP Defense/NNP Minister/NNP ,/, Binyamin/NNP Ben/NNP Eliezer/NNP ,/, who/WP was/VBD also/RB visiting/VBG Washington/NNP Thursday/NNP ,/, told/VBD reporters/NNS that/IN Bush/NNP 's/POS national/JJ security/NN adviser/NN Condoleezza/NNP Rice/NNP had/VBD a/DT different/JJ take/NN on/IN Arafat/NNP 's/POS confinement/NN ./.

``/`` Rice/NNP believes/VBZ that/IN keeping/VBG Arafat/NNP in/IN Ramallah/NNP could/MD have/VB the/DT opposite/JJ effect/NN of/IN strengthening/VBG rather/RB than/IN weakening/VBG him/PRP ,/, ''/'' Eliezer/NNP said/VBD ./.

The/DT Israeli/JJ official/NN ,/, who/WP also/RB met/VBD here/RB with/IN Cheney/NNP and/CC with/IN Defense/NNP Secretary/NNP Donald/NNP Rumsfeld/NNP ,/, said/VBD he/PRP had/VBD ``/`` warmly/RB recommended/VBN the/DT Americans/NNPS to/TO focus/VB all/PDT their/PRP$ efforts/NNS in/IN establishing/VBG a/DT dialogue/NN with/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN Palestinians/NNPS in/IN Arafat/NNP 's/POS entourage/NN ./.
