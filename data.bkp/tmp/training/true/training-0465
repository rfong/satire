Bilateral/JJ relations/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD once/RB strained/VBN ,/, have/VBP already/RB warmed/VBN considerably/RB since/IN a/DT 1997/CD summit/NN between/IN then/JJ Japanese/JJ prime/JJ minister/NN Ryutaro/NNP Hashimoto/NNP and/CC former/JJ president/NN ,/, Boris/NNP Yeltsin/NNP ,/, Alexander/NNP Panov/NNP told/VBD reporters/NNS at/IN the/DT Foreign/NNP Correspondents/NNP '/POS Club/NNP of/IN Japan/NNP ./.

In/IN September/NNP 2000/CD during/IN a/DT Russo-Japanese/JJ summit/NN in/IN Tokyo/NNP ,/, President/NNP Vladimir/NNP Putin/NNP said/VBD he/PRP would/MD stand/VB by/IN his/PRP$ country/NN 's/POS 1956/CD pledge/NN to/TO return/VB the/DT islands/NNS ./.

Although/IN the/DT population/NN of/IN the/DT islands/NNS is/VBZ set/VBN at/IN just/RB 15,700/CD ,/, the/DT sector/NN is/VBZ believed/VBN to/TO harbor/NN marine/NN and/CC mineral/NN resources/NNS worth/IN tens/NNS of/IN billions/NNS of/IN dollars/NNS ./.
