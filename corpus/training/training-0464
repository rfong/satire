Sixteen dead whales beached in Denmark 
The bodies of 16 sperm whales were washed up on the southwestern Danish
island of Roemoe on Wednesday, the biggest single incident involving
dead whales in Denmark, police said.
"The whales, each about 10 metres (30 feet) long, were spotted about
8:00 a.m. (0700 GMT) on the beach at Lakolk by a policeman on the
island," a spokesman said.
"Its the largest number of whales ever found in Denmark," he added.
The whales had been dead for four or five days before being driven to
the shoreline by winds, said whale expert Jeppe Ebdrup.
The sperm whales will be incinerated. Another whale which became
beached in January was destroyed after experts discovered it contained
20 times more cadmium and twice as much mercury than fish.
