Chris Sligh Throws Temper Tantrum After American Idol Boot
Chris Sligh threw an "I didn't want to play with you anyway" after his
American Idol sendoff on Wednesday. Sligh, the chunky contestant with
curly hair, glasses, and the hottie wife, claimed that he wasn't trying
to win and was self-sabotaging his chances.
"They didn't like my song last week, so I don't like them very much.
Ryan keeps making passes at my wife, Simon doesn't like my weight,
Randy is jealous that I have more hair than him, and I'm probably the
only male contestant that Paula hasn't asked out. They're not going to
be my friends anymore!"
Sligh did vow to quickly post naked pictures of himself, ala Antonella
Barba and Alaina Alexander, on the internet in this year's Idol ritual.
Chris shaved his afro, put on his contacts, and went to the woods near
his house to pose for the pictures.
While he vowed to title his photo shoot "Naked in Nature," detractors
wonder if it should not be called "Mass in the Meadow" or "Blubber at
the Beach."
