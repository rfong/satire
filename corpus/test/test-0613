Ladies Golf Association to Use Mississippi Voter Registration Test to
Disqualify Foreign Golfers!
A top ladies professional golf association has joined with the
Mississippi Klavern of the Ku Klux Klan to administer the 1950's state
voter registration test that kept black voters off the voting rolls.
This impossible to pass exam will be given to all foreign lady golfers
in a xenophobic effort to prevent them from competing with the US's
inferior divot diggers.
Sample questions for the rigged quiz released to the press included:
* How many women did Babe Didrickson?
* Was Tigger born in the 40 acre Woods?
* What did Gary Player slip into Arnold's palm?
* Did Jack Nicklaus have a dime in his golf bag?
