New Rice Processing Plant Opened in Myanmar
The 360-ton Hlinethaya rice processing plant was built by the state-run
Myanma Agricultural Produce Trading (MAPT) with Thai machinery and
equipment at a cost of 3.944 million U.S. dollars plus 226.68 million
kyats (708,375 dollars).
It is the second rice processing plant of similar capacity built by the
MAPT. The first plant was constructed in the capital' s Ahlone township
in 1995.
According to official statistics, Myanmar exported a total of 48,700
tons of rice in the first eight months of 1999, a drop of 8. 1 percent
over the same period of 1998. In 1998, the country exported 111,700
tons of rice.
To meet the food demand of the increasing population, which grows by 2
percent annually, the Myanmar government has, since January 1999,
leased out 400,000 hectares of vacant and virgin land for cultivation
by private entrepreneurs.
Myanmar's cultivable land covers 18.22 million hectares, of which 9.31
million hectares have been utilized.
