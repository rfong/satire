Iran Forms High Council on Mass Media 
Iran has set up a council for supervising the mass media, the official
news agency IRNA reported on Wednesday.
The High Council on Mass Media chaired by Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami was formed by Iran's Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution
on Tuesday night, IRNA said.
The media council is aimed at averting further chaotic factional
fightings of the mass media, according to the news agency.
Iran's mass media have recently split and engaged in fierce attacks
against each other over the April 4 detention of Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a close ally of President Mohammad Khatami, on
charges of embezzlement.
As a policy-making body, the media council is expected to formulate
comprehensive criteria for either governmental or non-governmental
media.
Members of the council include five cabinet ministers and heads of the
Plan and Budget Organization, National Library, Standard Institute and
State Organization for Employment and Administrative Affairs.
It is not known how this new establishment will affect the operation of
the country's bustling mass media.
