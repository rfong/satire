Communist Party chief calls for stronger controls over joint ventures 
Vietnam's Communist Party chief has called for tougher state controls
over foreign joint ventures, saying greater oversight of economic
reforms is needed to protect the socialist system, a party newspaper
said Thursday.
"We cannot have socialism if we don't strengthen the state sector, and
if we don't supervise cooperation and the joint ventures," General
Secretary Do Muoi said in the Nhan Dan newspaper.
The warning follows similar statements on Vietnam's economic opening
and comes in the runup to the Communist Party's 8th congress in June,
which could be the occasion for members to voice opposition to the pace
of economic reforms.
Many foreign investors and economists have said the biggest unknown on
Vietnam's economic front this year is the position the congress, held
every five years, will take on economic reform policies.
"The state sector has relaxed its hold, allowing the private sector to
dominate," the party leader said, adding, "we must assure that the
state sector has the ruling role."
"Sufficient attention has not been paid to the question of cooperation
and to the joint ventures between state enterprises and ... foreign
capitalist enterprises in production as well as in services," he said.
"As Lenin himself taught, we must not fear capitalist firms themselves,
but rather our ability to control and supervise them," he said.
