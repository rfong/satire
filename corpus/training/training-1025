Bush Proposes Increase for Education Department Spending
Bush announced his plan at Townsend Elementary School in the Smoky
Mountains near Knoxville, Tennessee State.
"There is no more important subject than public education. We must get
it right," Bush told an audience of teachers, students and parents at
the school as he wrapped up a two-day swing to promote his domestic
agenda.
Bush will highlight his fiscal 2002 budget in an address to a joint
session of Congress next Tuesday, followed by formal submission of the
plan Wednesday. It will cover the fiscal year that begins October 1.
