Peregrine protests action against its staff in Bangladesh 
Peregrine Investments Holdings Ltd. has lodged a protest to the
Bangladesh government over an arrest warrant issued for a staff member
in its investment banking business in the south asian country, its
chairman Philip Tose said Friday.
"I have today written a letter of protest to the Prime Minister of
Bangladesh concerning her Government's unjust action against my staff,"
said Tose in a statement.
The protest was made as police in Dhaka armed with arrest warrants
Thursday hunted for 36 people implicated in Bangladesh's worst stock
market scam which left hundreds of small investors bankrupt.
Leading Hong Kong brokerage Peregrine said among those named was Runa
Alam, owner of SES Securities, the firm through which Peregrine
conducts its international institutional brokerage transactions in
Bangladesh.
Peregrine group compliance director Alan Mercer said in the statement:
"Peregrine's operations in Bangladesh have been carried out to the
highest international standards with internal control procedure of a
quality never seen before in Bangladesh."
"Other than for reasons of political expedience, it is incomprehensible
why Ms Alam, and with her Peregrine, should be blamed in anyway for a
classic stock market bust in an underdeveloped country," he added.
Peregrine alleged that the issue of the warrant against Alam arose out
of a failure by the authorities to control a stock market bubble that
saw the Dhaka Stock Exchange Index rise on high volume from 900 to
3,700 in 1996, with the bubble bursting in December 1996.
"The rise was driven exclusively by domestic retail money and an
uncontrolled market in securities that was permitted to operate for
many months on the pavement outside the Dhaka Stock Exchange," the
statement said.
Bangladeshi authorities have issued warrants of arrest for 36 company
owners as well as dealers and brokers hours after charges were filed
against 15 companies.
The development comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
capital market watchdog, filed charges with Dhaka's chief metropolitan
magistrates court accusing the 36 of resorting to "fraudulent acts"
causing "unusual ups and downs" on the Dhaka and Chittagong share
markets, the officials said.
The official BSS news agency reported late Wednesday that the charges
were filed on the basis of an investigation.
Thousands of people, encouraged by steps towards market liberalisation
from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed's government, invested in the
market, some of them selling land and other properties.
But many lost huge slices of their investments in a massive slide in
prices after an unprecedented bullish trend caused by stock
manipulations which caused a boom-and-bust effect, the sources said.
