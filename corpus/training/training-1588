Indonesian Davis Cup Team to Warm up in India 
Indonesia's Davis Cup team will warm up in three future tournaments in
India prior to the Davis Cup Asia Oceania Zone Group II first round
match against the Philippines in February in Manila.
Coach Dedy Prasetyo said the six members of the team will compete in
the clay-court Future 1 tournament in Hyderabad from January 10 to 16;
the Future 2 in Bangalore from January 17 to 23; and in the hard-court
Future 3 in Chennai from January 24 to 29.
"We shall observe the players' tactical understanding, emotionalcontrol
and mistake management at the tournaments. The first point is to see if
the players are able to overcome different type of players, be they
serve-and-volleyers, baseliner or counterattacker types," he was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
"The second point is to see if the players can control their emotions,
especially when they are under pressure at critical points. They must
be able to decide when to play aggressively, when to defend and when to
counterattack. This can only be gained in tournaments and not in
practice sessions," he said.
"The last point to observe is if they make unforced errors, especially
at critical moments of a match. Usually our players tend to overhit in
the deciding points which results in errors. They must also develop
their mental endurance as they will play five sets in the Davis Cup
matches in Manila," he added.
The Indonesian Tennis Association will announce the core team off our
players, one substitute and the coaches on January 4, one day before
they fly to India.
The team will fly directly to Manila to adapt to the conditions before
competing from February 4 to 6.
