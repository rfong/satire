Dollar extends Friday's rise 
The dollar extended its rise on Monday morning, climbing to 1.6715
marks from 1.6665 at the Friday close, when it rose on encouraging US
employment figures.
The US jobless rate unexpectedly fell from 6.4 to 6.0 percent in May,
though only 191,000 non-farm jobs were created against an average
forecast of 285,000.
"The dollar is gaining on a more positive environment," said analyst
Robert Hayward, at the Bank of America.
"The stabilising of the US futures market should continue to show
benefits for the greenback this week, as should tension with North
Korea where the dollar benefits as a safe-haven currency."
He said, however, that the dollar could fall on profit-taking towards
the middle of the week, dipping to around 1.6650 marks before lifting
to end the week above 1.67 marks.
"US producer prices, expected on Friday, are not expected to provoke
the market into a panic," he said.
Among the European currencies, the pound rose to 2.5156 marks from
2.5097, while the lira rose to 971.50 to the mark from 972.35. But the
French franc lost some of Friday's gains, dropping to 3.4140 to the
mark from 3.4116.
Hayward said the pound and the peseta could suffer from nervousness
ahead of the European elections towards the end of the week, with the
results having potential political repercussions in Britain and Spain.
"But there is nothing to fear for the French franc or the lira, as the
election results are expected to be good for the French and Italian
governments," he said.
The escudo remained under pressure at 103.58 to the mark from 103.66 on
Friday, despite a statement from the Portugese finance minister Eduardo
Catroga on Saturday denying the currency would be devalued after the
European elections.
By midmorning, the greenback was trading at 1.6715 marks from 1.6665 at
the Friday close, at 105.43 yen from 105.25, at 1.4205 Swiss francs
from 1.4168 and at 5.7038 French francs from 5.6913.
Sterling was trading at 1.5050 dollars from 1.5060, at 2.5156 marks
from 2.5097, at 158.67 yen from 158.51, at 2.1379 Swiss francs from
2.1337 and at 8.5841 French francs from 8.5710.
In Paris, the dollar and most of the European currencies were higher in
calm trading, with the exception of the French franc.
One Paris trader said the greenback and, in its wake most of the
European currencies, had lifted on speculation that long-term interests
have reached a peak for the time being, with capital gains therefore to
be made.
By midmorning, the mark was trading at 3.4152 French francs from 3.4130
at the Friday close.
The greenback was trading at 5.7055 French francs from 5.6930, at
1.6710 marks from 1.6670 and at 105.45 yen from 105.41.
Sterling lifted to 8.5859 French francs from 8.5572 at the Friday
close.
The yen rose to 5.4152 French francs (for 100 yen) from 5.4071.
