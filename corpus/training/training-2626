New South Wales sign off in style 
New South Wales finished off their part in the Super 12 tournament in
style with a 52-25 win over Wellington here on Friday.
After winning three of their opening four games, the Waratahs chalked
up their fifth win of the Super 12 campaign, scoring seven tries to
three in their final match before almost 21,000 fans. NSW lost six
times in the tournament.
All but one of the tries came from the backline, with winger Alistair
Murdoch scoring a hattrick of tries and Wallaby fullback Matthew Burke
passing 150 points for the series with a match tally of 22 points from
a try, four conversions and three penalties.
Some New South Wales players thrust themselves back into Australian
contention, with Murdoch, winger David Campese, prop Richard Harry and
flanker Michael Brial all serving notice on the selectors for the
coming internationals against Wales, Canada, New Zealand and South
Africa.
Exciting Wellington fullback Christian Cullen scored the try of the
match, ending a move that started under his own goal posts and ended
under NSW's crossbar.
The Wellington Hurricanes finished the Super 12 series with three wins
and eight defeats.
This defeat leaves them fourth from bottom of the standings with three
matches this weekend to complete the 11 rounds of matches.
