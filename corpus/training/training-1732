Turkish Firms Dominate Russian Construction 
Turkish firms have become the leading contractors in Russia's booming
construction market, local press reported today.
According to local newspaper Daily News, Russian Trade Representative
Victor Koptevsky made the remarks in a two-day symposium entitled
"Turkey and the International Construction Market" in the largest
Turkish city of Istanbul.
"At present, Turkey's companies are in the first place in the Russian
construction market among the foreign companies," the representative
said.
He added some 150 Turkish contractors were working on more than 200
construction projects in Russia, involving a total volume of 5 billion
U.S. dollars.
Turkish contractors such as Enka, Entes, Alarko, Gama, Tekfen, Baytur
and Tekser have been involved in construction in Russia for the past 15
years, Koptevsky said, adding that even a large number of small
companies joined competion at the thriving construction market there.
The Russian trade official, however, noted that these small companies,
most of them without international contracting experience, did not do a
satisfactory job, thus affecting the reputation of the Turkish
construction industry.
Koptevsky noted that a severe shortage of fund in Russia had resulted
in the reduced scale of the country's major construction projects, and
he urged Turkish banks to extend more loans to the Russian construction
market.
According to a report jointly prepared by the Turkish Contractors'
Association and the Union of International Contractors, Turkish
companies implemented nearly half of their foreign contracts in Russia
between 1990 and 1996.
Turkish contractors are also very active in many other countries,
including Libya, Kazakhstan, Germany, Turkmenistan, Kuwait, Belarus,
Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Azerbaijan.
The symposium, sponsored by the Ankara-based Contractors' Association,
ended on Wednesday.
