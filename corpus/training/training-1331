Tokyo stocks rise, in line with other Asian bourses
Japanese share prices rose Tuesday, in line with most other Asian
bourses that took heart from a rally on Wall Street and some bargain
hunting.
In Tokyo, shares staged a late rally with the key market index closing
1.8 percent higher on futures-led gains and purchases of leading issues
by institutional investors, brokers said.
"Investors reacted positively to the gains of the futures," a
securities house dealer said. "But there are no convincing reasons for
prices to maintain their uptrend."
The Nikkei-225 index rose 357.32 points to finish at 20,559.59 while
the Topix index of all issues on the exchange's first section was up
17.65 points at 1,560.23.
Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region:
HONG KONG: Hong Kong share prices rose 0.1 percent following gains on
Wall Street, dealers said.
PrimeEast Securities sales director Allen Cheng said the mood among
domestic fund managers was "decidedly more upbeat after the latest Wall
Street reaction to the outlook for interest rates."
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index gained 11.02
points to finish at 11,223.62.
SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed 0.2 percent higher, buoyed by
strong trading on Wall Street but capped by tumbling BHP shares,
brokers said.
"It was generally a little disappointing the market didn't respond a
bit more favourably to Wall Street's rise overnight," Lance Jones
broker Philip Toop said. "The market was really dragged down by BHP."
The Australian Stock Exchange's main indicator, the all ordinaries
index, gained 5.1 points to 2,255.9.
SINGAPORE: Singapore's blue-chip stock index closed 0.6 percent higher
with late buying interest focussed on heavyweight Cycle and Carriage
Ltd.
"This strong interest in Cycle and Carriage, which accounts for 11
percent of the Straits Times Industrial Index, helped pushed up the
index," said a broker. The stock gained 30 cents to close at 13.50
dollars.
The Straits Times Industrials Index of the Stock Exchage of Singapore
closed 13.23 points higher at 2,111.68. The broader All-Singapore Index
ended 3.58 points higher at 527.15.
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's key share index ended 0.7 percent higher as
institutions hunted for bargains among selected blue chips, brokers
said.
