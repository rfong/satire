Mexico to Increase Oil Exports By 150,000 
Mexico will increase its oil exports by 150,000 barrels per day ( bpd)
starting April 1, Energy Minister Luis Tellez announced Wednesday.
Tellez said that the 4.6 percent increase over the present output is
the answer to the agreement announced by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC).
He told the press that this is a "moderate" figure that will permit to
maintain the consensus among the producing countries, with which Mexico
contributes to the oil market stability.
He said that the figure corresponds in the first place to Mexico's
trade interests, and in the second place, to the producing countries
consensus to maintain crude prices stable.
Mexico is not OPEC member but it was one of the main world oil output
reduction promoters in March of 1998, to achieve a price increase. For
maintaining the stable oil prices, Mexico have cut its oil- put to 2.9
million bpd so far from that date.
