Deputies/NNPS voted/VBD by/IN 110/CD votes/NNS to/TO one/CD ,/, with/IN four/CD abstentions/NNS to/TO modify/VB the/DT former/JJ Yugoslav/NNP republic/NN 's/POS emblem/NN ,/, removing/VBG a/DT contested/VBN 16-pointed/JJ sun/NN symbol/NN from/IN the/DT flag/NN which/WDT had/VBD been/VBN at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN a/DT four-year/JJ feud/NN between/IN Skopje/NNP and/CC Athens/NNP ./.

The/DT parliamentary/JJ vote/NN came/VBD as/IN Macedonian/NNP television/NN cited/VBD medical/JJ sources/NNS as/IN saying/VBG that/IN President/NNP Kiro/NNP Gligorov/NNP ,/, seriously/RB injured/VBN Tuesday/NNP in/IN a/DT carbomb/NN attack/NN ,/, was/VBD in/IN a/DT slightly/RB more/RBR comfortable/JJ condition/NN ./.

The/DT television/NN said/VBD Gligorov/NNP ,/, 78/CD ,/, who/WP required/VBD six/CD hours/NNS of/IN surgery/NN to/TO remove/VB shrapnel/NN and/CC two/CD blood/NN clots/NNS from/IN his/PRP$ brain/NN following/VBG the/DT attack/NN ,/, had/VBD passed/VBN a/DT peaceful/JJ night/NN and/CC that/IN doctors/NNS anticipated/VBD advancing/VBG his/PRP$ treatment/NN in/IN consultation/NN with/IN foreign/JJ experts/NNS ./.

Gligorov/NNP ,/, widely/RB credited/VBN with/IN holding/VBG the/DT potentially/RB explosive/JJ Macedonian/NNP republic/NN together/RB as/IN conflict/NN spread/NN across/IN former/JJ Yugoslavia/NNP ,/, steered/VBD his/PRP$ country/NN towards/IN a/DT UN-brokered/JJ agreement/NN reached/VBN with/IN Greece/NNP last/JJ month/NN ,/, which/WDT required/VBD Skopje/NNP to/TO change/VB its/PRP$ flag/NN and/CC constitution/NN in/IN return/NN for/IN Athens/NNP lifting/VBG an/DT embargo/NN against/IN the/DT country/NN ./.

Athens/NNP argued/VBD that/IN both/PDT the/DT ancient/JJ 16-pointed/JJ symbol/NN --/: the/DT so-called/JJ Sun/NNP of/IN Vergina/NNP --/: on/IN the/DT old/JJ flag/NN and/CC the/DT name/NN of/IN Macedonia/NNP are/VBP part/NN of/IN Greek/JJ history/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN Macedonia/NNP 's/POS use/NN of/IN both/DT were/VBD tantamount/JJ to/TO territorial/VB designs/NNS on/IN the/DT northern/JJ Greek/JJ province/NN of/IN the/DT same/JJ name/NN ./.

The/DT overwhelming/JJ parliamentary/JJ approval/NN Thursday/NNP removes/VBZ the/DT Sun/NNP of/IN Vergina/NNP symbol/NN ,/, introducing/VBG with/IN immediate/JJ effect/NN a/DT new/JJ Macedonian/NNP flag/NN with/IN a/DT yellow/JJ orb/NN on/IN a/DT red/JJ background/NN ./.

Thereafter/RB both/DT sides/NNS will/MD start/VB to/TO address/VB the/DT thorny/JJ issue/NN of/IN Macedonia/NNP 's/POS name/NN ./.

The/DT parliament/NN also/RB used/VBD Thursday/NNP 's/POS session/NN to/TO condemn/VB the/DT attack/NN against/IN Gligorov/NNP ,/, which/WDT it/PRP called/VBD ``/`` a/DT terrorist/JJ act/NN aimed/VBN at/IN getting/VBG rid/JJ of/IN the/DT most/RBS prominent/JJ Macedonian/NNP personality/NN working/VBG for/IN peace/NN and/CC the/DT peaceful/JJ solution/NN of/IN disputes/NNS in/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.
