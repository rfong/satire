Dos Santos, Savimbi Pledge Cooperation After Summit
Angola's two most powerful leaders concluded a crucial summit Saturday
by embracing and pledging to work together to end 20 years of civil
war.
The festival atmosphere following three hours of talks between Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was
similar to past celebrations of peace that later collapsed.
But a changing political landscape in southern African and the
realization that neither side could ever vanquish the other militarily
made the promises and smiles Saturday seem more enduring.
The meeting in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, produced plans to meet
again in Angola on an unspecified date and commitments to work together
to implement a peace treaty their subordinates negotiated and signed
last year.
There was no mention of a government role for Savimbi or holding
elections to choose a new government _ two issues considered likely to
come up.
By endorsing the Lusaka protocol agreed to last November, dos Santos
and Savimbi likely secured deployment of a 7,460-troop United Nations
force to provide security while fighters from Savimbi's National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) disarm.
``I feel it is most important that we express in a clear fashion a good
political will,'' dos Santos said at a closing ceremony. He praised
Savimbi's cooperative spirit and said he wished ``this fraternal
environment should last forever.''
Applause greeted his speech, and he and Savimbi then shook hands and
embraced. Savimbi then gave his support to dos Santos and the treaty in
a conciliatory speech.
``We had a discussion between brothers. I am going back completely
comforted,'' he said. ``I have told the president he is president of my
country, therefore he is my president.''
He urged Angolans to resist the skepticism spurred by previous failed
peace treaties, and said he and dos Santos would speak to each other
directly to avoid any misunderstandings.
``We want Angolans to know stability,'' he said. ``We are going to
build a very happy future for our people. This is the end.''
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who hosted the summit and a year
of tortuous negotiations that produced the Lusaka treaty, called dos
Santos and Savimbi ``agents of peace, not the merchants of
destruction.'' He held their hands, the dos Santos and Savimbi embraced
a second time for a throng of journalists.
The talks, postponed a day due to a boycott by dos Santos, were the
first between the two since 1991 and gave the strongest signal to date
they might be ready to quit fighting.
Dos Santos and Savimbi have twice before shaken hands and declared
peace, but failed to stop the two decades of fighting that claimed
500,000 lives and devastated the oil- and diamond-rich southern African
country.
Unlike the previous failed efforts, the Lusaka agreement was considered
more likely to succeed because it came in a new political landscape in
southern Africa. With Mozambique holding successful elections after
years of war and South Africa ending apartheid with a peaceful vote
last year, regional pressure increased to stabilize southern Africa by
halting Angola's combat.
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had stipulated the summit
as a condition for deployment of the peacekeepers. Battalions in
Uruguay, Brazil, Pakistan and India have been out on indefinite standby
until the stalemate is resolved, their defense ministries said
recently.
The summit almost got canceled, with dos Santos announcing on Angolan
national radio Friday he called off his trip to Lusaka because of
confusion over whether Savimbi would attend. His announcement came
shortly after Savimbi arrived in Lusaka.
Diplomats in Zambia said both sides came under heavy pressure Friday to
avoid canceling the summit. Dos Santos was warned he risked harming
Angola's chances for future U.N. intervention and foreign aid if he
refused to meet Savimbi.
Angolan national radio later broadcast a second statement announcing
dos Santos would fly to Lusaka for talks Saturday.
Angola's first peace pact fell apart on the eve of independence from
Portugal in 1975 when dos Santos' party grabbed total control and tried
to wipe out UNITA and other opposition.
The war grew into an East-West proxy battle, with South African troops
and U.S. guns and money backing UNITA against the Soviet and
Cuban-supported leftist government.
Dos Santos and Savimbi signed a new treaty in 1991, but fighting
erupted 18 months later when dos Santos' party won democratic elections
and UNITA cried fraud and returned to arms.
A year of U.N.-led peace talks, coupled with sanctions against UNITA
and a successful government offensive, led to the Lusaka protocol six
months ago.
