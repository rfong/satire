Jordan-Gulf Ties Improved, Minister Says 
Jordan has succeeded in mending ties with neighbors which went soured
during the 1991 Gulf War, said Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh today.
The country's relations with most Gulf countries have been greatly
improved, Tarawneh who just concluded a two-day visit to Bahrain during
the weekend, was quoted by the Bahraini News Agency as saying.
Jordan offended the Gulf states for siding with Iraq during the Gulf
War in 1991. After the war, which ended with the liberation of Kuwait
from Iraqi occupation, Jordan distanced itself from Iraq and gradually
repaired its ties with neighbors, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the
UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
Jordanian leaders or senior officials have visited the Gulf countries,
except Kuwait, in a bid to revamp their ties.
Though Amman's relationship with Kuwait is still kept cool, the
Jordanian foreign minister said that it has gone back to a right track
and "begun to step ahead positively."
Tarawneh said air traffic and postal services between the two countries
have been resumed. Investment and trade situation has also been
improved.
He said that Amman is ready to open its embassy in Kuwait again, which
was closed in the Gulf War.
"The Kuwaiti embassy in Amman keeps open while the Jordanian Embassy in
Kuwait remains closed. But We are completely ready to open it at any
time," he said.
Meanwhile, Tarawneh described Jordan's relationship with Iraq as
"good." A bilateral trade protocol is still effective.
