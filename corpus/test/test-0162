But Tokyo and Seoul remain distrustful of their heavily armed neighbor, and
they want to press for a full accounting of how any food aid is distributed
to ensure that it does not go to the military.
Global response to North Korea's unprecedented appeal for aid has been
tepid. An interagency UN appeal for 15.7 million dollars in aid for
North Korea has so far raised less than two million dollars for food
assistance.
The UN World Food Programme (WFP) is currently arranging for a new food
shipment in February of wheat and corn, which is less expensive than
rice and may feed more people, a UN source told AFP.
Washington has sought to act in concert with Tokyo and Seoul on aid for
North Korea. Any unilateral effort by the Clinton administration,
moreover, could run into opposition from the Republican-run Congress.
