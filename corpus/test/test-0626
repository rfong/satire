Eternally China - in Diving Pool 
The outcome of the University Games' diving competitions is in line
with what one has come to expect: It was once again the Chinese who
distinguished themselves.
They turned in a stunning performance on their home soil, taking all
twelve gold medals on offer, including two team titles, plus four
silvers. This is much better than their haul of four golds and one
silver in six events at the last Universiade.
It also eclipsed their previous best Universiade record - a sweep of
all four golds in as many events and both team titles at the Zagreb
Universiade in 1987, when the 1m springboard events have not yet been
introduced.
A distant second in the medal tally is Mexico, which got three silvers
mainly by courtesy of veteran Fernando Platas. The 28-year- old was
beaten into second by Chinese in both the individual and the
synchronized men's 3m springboard events, as he was at the Sydney
Olympics and the Fukuoka World Championships. Mexico also ranked second
in the men's team standings.
Ukraine took two silvers and a bronze to be the third, followed by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea with one silver and two bronzes.
Cuba got one silver and one bronze to place fifth, ahead of Spain with
one silver only.
Russia, Japan and Germany shared the seventh slot in the medal tally,
with two bronzes each. Hungary and the United States tied for tenth,
with one bronze each.
In the diving program which drew more than 90 divers from 25 countries
and regions, the hosts China were simply unstoppable in each and every
diving event. They powered along through preliminaries, semifinals and
finals, leaving their rivals far behind and gaping. Their matchless
skills and breath-taking elegance in the air filled not only the
audience, but their rivals, with awe.
"They're excellent," Mexican veteran Fernando Platas said after taking
his second silver medal at the Universiade, in the men's synchronized
3m springboard. He had earlier been denied gold in the 3m individual
event by China's Wang Tianling.
The Olympic and world championships silver medalist said he was not
disappointed. "It's always a pleasure to be able to compete with such
excellent divers. I'm happy to get the medal," he said.
Other divers also willingly admitted defeat. "Chinese divers seem to be
kind of in a different league," German Ditte Kotzian said after
finishing third in the women's synchronized 3m springboard Wednesday.
"Our performance here were all right. I think we've done pretty well,"
she said of the only two bronzes Germany managed to get.
Olympic bronze medalist Ukrainian Ganna Sorokina also praised Chinese
divers. "They are on a very high level. We tried to beat them in all
the competitions, but we didn't," she said.
"We hope to have better luck in the future," Sorokina said after
finishing second in the women's synchronized 3m springboard.
Ukrainian coach Tatyana Turova described China as "the best in the
world". "Everybody would have to work very hard to perform as well as
they do," she said.
Zhou Jihong, Chinese diving team manager, said China have done pretty
well at the Universiade. "We sent our best student divers to the games,
and their performances were not bad," she said after the awarding
ceremony of the team titles.
But she warned against complacency, saying there were still room for
improvement. "Some of our divers have not done well in the competition.
They made mistakes with some difficult dives. This showed that we still
need to work on that, to improve the stability on difficult dives," she
said.
She was referring to Wang Feng, who came fourth in the men's 3m
springboard final and Li Chengwei, who came fifth in the men's 10m
platform final. Li's fifth place was the worst showing of any one
Chinese diver at the Universiade.
While expressing satisfaction with his team's performance at the games,
Mexican coach Stefan Marinov spoke highly of China's organization of
the University Games. "Chinese divers are excellent. China's
organization of the games are also very good. I want to congratulate
China for its wonderful organization of the games. The tournament is a
success," he said.
