Derivatives new risk to global financial system: congressional report 
Derivatives, largely unregulated financial instruments that have grown
into a 12-trillion-dollar market, threaten the global financial system,
according to a congressional study reported in The Washington Post
Wednesday.
The two-year study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) was scheduled
for release Wednesday and will serve as a basis for discussion in
various congressional panels.
The report will boost pressure on the Clinton administration to
formulate policies to safeguard the financial system, an official
familiar with high-level talks within the administration was quoted as
saying.
Derivatives are financial instruments so named because they "derive"
their value from other things, such as stocks or interest rates.
According to the Post, the GAO researchers wrote that if a large dealer
of derivatives "failed, the failure could pose risks to other firms --
including federally insured depository institutions -- and the
financial system as a whole."
The report recommended that Congress "bring the currently unregulated
... derivatives activities of securities firms and insurance company
affiliates" under the scrutiny of federal regulators.
It also called for comprehensive international supervision of
derivatives, which trade largely unregulated.
The GAO suggested that the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), the
federal watchdog on US financial markets, be assigned responsibility
for overseeing derivatives and the creation of an interagency
commission "to establish principles and standards for each federal
financial regulator to use in supervising derivative activities."
The Post said that Wall Street "already hates" the GAO report,
according to executives at major derivatives dealers who were briefed
this week on a draft version of the report.
