Dollar retreats on Greenspan remarks 
The dollar retreated against major currencies in Singapore trading
Friday on US Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan's cautionary
remarks on asset inflation, dealers said.
The greenback fell to 1.5400 marks after opening at 1.5538 and 112.15
yen from 112.58, according to rates provided by Banque Nationale de
Paris. It recovered slightly from an intra-day low of 1.5330.
"It is basically a reflection of the weakness in the US assets'
market," said Andy Tan, general manager of MMS International.
"A big portion of that can be linked to Greenspan's comments that he
would not be concerned about a collapsing financial assets' bubble. His
comments also heightened market concerns that the Fed may want to raise
interest rates.
"The concern is that if US interest rates go up, it will be bad for the
US bond market and the equity market," Tan said.
Greenspan said in a speech Thursday in the United States that he would
not be concerned about a collapsing financial assets bubble if it did
not affect the real economy.
"Given that many of the investments in the US assets market are
actually from Japan, if you have a collapse in the US treasury and
equity markets, it can lead to an outflow of Japanese funds back into
the Japanese market which would weigh down the dollar-yen," Tan said.
"And if you have the dollar-yen going down, it would translate into
weakness against the mark and Asian currencies," he added..
The dollar closed lower at 5.2010 French francs from an opening level
of 5.2465. The pound was unchanged at 1.6370 dollars.
In regional play, the greenback closed lower at 1.4005 Singapore
dollars from Thursday's close of 1.4022 and 2.5185 Malaysian ringgit
from 2,5210, and higher at 2,351.50 Indonesian rupiah from 2,348.50. It
was unchanged at 25.54 Thai baht.
