Indian pair fined for "charging" at umpire
Indian cricketers Saurav Ganguly and Pankaj Dharmani have been fined 25
percent of their match fee following an incident in the third Test against
South Africa involving English umpire Peter Willey.
Match referee Barry Jarman said on Tuesday the two players had been
fined for bringing the game into disrepute and attempting to intimidate
an umpire.
The incident occurred on the last morning Monday of the drawn match.
Public SABC radio said the the two players were fined for "charging at"
Willey after he turned down a bat-pad appeal against South African
batsman Adam Bacher, but Jarman denied this.
"Bacher was not involved at all," he said, but declined to give
details.
Meanwhile, South African allrounder Brian McMillan has been forced to
withdraw from the triangular limited-over cricket series involving
South Africa, India and Zimbabwe which starts on Thursday.
The player has an inflamed tendon on his left foot. His place in the
14-man squad will be taken by fellow Western Province bowler Craig
Matthews, the former vice-captain.
