Champ Christie will run in the Olympics, claims chief rival 
Sprint champion Linford Christie's claims that he will not defend his
Olympic 100m title later this year were laughed off by chief rival
Donovan Bailey on Tuesday.
Bailey, who won the world title in Gothenburg last year, is convinced
the British sprint star will be at the start line in Atlanta despite
repeated denials.
The 28-year-old Canadian said: "He's running. We all know he's running.
"He's been training all year and apparently he's only running three or
four indoor meets."
Bailey, who took advantage of a Christie hamstring injury to take his
world title in a scorching 9.97sec ahead of compatriot Bruny Surin,
added: "That's a huge indication that he plans on excelling in the
summer and if he is planning on excelling in the summer he'd definitely
want to do it in Atlanta I'm sure."
Christie, who has been training in Australia, showed his class in the
Adelaide leg of the Australian grand prix series on Friday, winning the
sprint in 10.00sec.
He announced last June that he would not defend his title, saying he
was sick of harassment and mistreatment by the media. He argued: "I
can't get more famous or more known than I am now. I have nothing to
win and everything to lose."
His fury with pressmen came to a head when he almost got into a brawl
with them at Heathrow airport and his determination to quit seemed to
harden still further after a row over appearance money with the British
Athletic Federation last season.
But his decision to run in the British AAA Championship in June, which
double as the Olympic trials, have increased speculation about his
intentions.
He also told spectators at Adelaide: "I want to go out with a bang this
year. I'm in better shape than last year and I'm very, very strong at
the moment."
