Arteaga/NNP named/VBD interim/JJ Ecuador/NNP president/NN as/IN crisis/NN ends/VBZ Ecuador/NNP 's/POS three-day/JJ political/JJ crisis/NN came/VBD to/TO an/DT apparent/JJ close/NN Sunday/NNP when/WRB Congress/NNP appointed/VBD Rosalia/NNP Arteaga/NNP ,/, vice/NN president/NN under/IN ousted/VBN leader/NN Abdala/NNP Bucaram/NNP ,/, the/DT nation/NN 's/POS first/JJ woman/NN president/NN ./.

Arteaga/NNP ,/, a/DT 40-year-old/JJ lawyer/NN and/CC educator/NN ,/, was/VBD made/VBN interim/JJ president/NN ,/, winning/VBG the/DT votes/NNS of/IN 45/CD of/IN 46/CD legislators/NNS present/JJ at/IN the/DT unicameral/JJ Congress/NNP in/IN a/DT pre-dawn/JJ special/JJ session/NN at/IN 4:00/CD a.m./RB -LRB-/-LRB- 0900/CD GMT/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Congress/NNP selected/VBD her/PRP for/IN a/DT ``/`` strictly/JJ limited/JJ period/NN ,/, ''/'' leaving/VBG open/RP the/DT possibility/NN of/IN designating/VBG another/DT interim/JJ leader/NN to/TO serve/VB until/IN August/NNP 1998/CD ,/, when/WRB new/JJ elections/NNS would/MD be/VB held/VBN ./.

Despite/IN the/DT move/NN ,/, Congress/NNP must/MD vote/VB again/RB to/TO approve/VB a/DT leader/NN to/TO rule/VB until/IN August/NNP 1998/CD with/IN at/IN least/JJS two-thirds/NNS of/IN the/DT 82-member/JJ Congress/NNP ,/, or/CC 55/CD votes/NNS ./.

Members/NNS of/IN Bucaram/NNP 's/POS party/NN were/VBD absent/JJ from/IN the/DT late-night/JJ session/NN ./.

Another/DT special/JJ session/NN of/IN the/DT legislature/NN was/VBD set/VBN for/IN Tuesday/NNP ./.

If/IN lawmakers/NNS choose/VBP someone/NN other/JJ than/IN Arteaga/NNP ,/, she/PRP would/MD return/VB to/TO the/DT vice/NN presidency/NN after/IN a/DT mere/JJ three/CD days/NNS as/IN president/NN ./.

It/PRP remained/VBD unclear/JJ whether/IN Arteaga/NNP ,/, Alarcon/NNP or/CC someone/NN else/RB would/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO get/VB a/DT majority/NN ./.

``/`` Ecuador/NNP deserves/VBZ a/DT new/JJ opportunity/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD a/DT tearful/JJ Arteaga/NN after/IN learning/VBG of/IN her/PRP$ appointment/NN ./.

``/`` An/DT enormous/JJ responsibility/NN has/VBZ fallen/VBN on/IN my/PRP$ shoulders/NNS ./.

Her/PRP$ appointment/NN ends/VBZ three/CD days/NNS of/IN turmoil/NN after/IN Bucaram/NNP was/VBD stripped/VBN of/IN the/DT presidency/NN Thursday/NNP on/IN grounds/NNS that/IN he/PRP was/VBD mentally/RB unfit/JJ ./.

Initially/RB ,/, Congress/NNP had/VBD named/VBN its/PRP$ own/JJ leader/NN ,/, Fabian/NNP Alarcon/NNP ,/, to/TO replace/VB Bucaram/NNP ,/, who/WP had/VBD refused/VBN to/TO step/VB down/RP ./.

That/DT step/NN touched/VBD off/RP a/DT three-way/JJ power/NN struggle/NN ./.

The/DT crisis/NN ended/VBD after/IN Bucaram/NNP and/CC Alarcon/NNP both/DT conceded/VBD the/DT presidency/NN as/IN military/JJ chiefs/NNS sought/VBN to/TO end/VB the/DT chaos/NN ./.

Bucaram/RB ,/, in/IN a/DT television/NN address/NN from/IN his/PRP$ home/NN town/NN of/IN Guayaquil/NNP ,/, acknowledged/VBD for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN that/IN he/PRP was/VBD stripped/VBN of/IN the/DT presidency/NN by/IN Congress/NNP ,/, but/CC continued/VBD to/TO call/VB the/DT move/NN a/DT coup/NN d'etat/NN ./.

After/IN a/DT meeting/NN of/IN leaders/NNS of/IN Congress/NNP and/CC the/DT military/NN ,/, Alarcon/NNP asked/VBD lawmakers/NNS to/TO cancel/VB his/PRP$ appointment/NN to/TO the/DT presidency/NN ,/, allowing/VBG him/PRP to/TO return/VB to/TO his/PRP$ post/NN as/IN president/NN of/IN Congress/NNP ./.

The/DT country/NN 's/POS armed/JJ forces/NNS chiefs/NNS moved/VBD to/TO end/VB the/DT crisis/NN Saturday/NNP by/IN saying/VBG they/PRP would/MD no/RB longer/RB recognize/VB Bucaram/NNP or/CC his/PRP$ declaration/NN of/IN a/DT state/NN of/IN emergency/NN ,/, his/PRP$ last/JJ move/NN before/IN he/PRP fled/VBD the/DT presidential/JJ palace/NN ./.

The/DT military/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ ruled/VBN Ecuador/NNP in/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, had/VBD taken/VBN pains/NNS to/TO maintain/VB its/PRP$ neutrality/NN during/IN the/DT crisis/NN ./.

The/DT three-way/JJ jockeying/NN for/IN the/DT presidency/NN was/VBD triggered/VBN Thursday/NNP when/WRB Congress/NNP voted/VBD to/TO oust/VB Bucaram/NNP on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN ``/`` mental/JJ incapacity/NN ./. ''/''

The/DT legislature/NN then/RB voted/VBD in/IN its/PRP$ president/NN ,/, Alarcon/NNP ,/, to/TO the/DT dismay/NN of/IN Arteaga/NNP who/WP said/VBD she/PRP should/MD have/VB succeeded/VBN Bucaram/NNP ./.
