Prosecutors also allege, without providing any details, that McNall and
his associates conspired to commit bank bribery by ``corruptly giving,
offering and promising things of value'' to unnamed bank officials.
The charges against McNall describe a complicated series of schemes
already detailed in charges filed against five former business
associates, including the vice president, controller and outside
accountant for McNall Sports &AMP; Entertainment, his chief holding
company.
All five associates have, or intend to, plead guilty to the charges
brought against them, according to their attorneys.
An additional half-dozen or so McNall associates still are negotiating
with prosecutors and could be charged as part of the continuing
investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal
Revenue Service, sources said.
Said his attorney Pollack, ``This is obviously a very difficult time
for Bruce and he's doing the best he can to get through it.''
