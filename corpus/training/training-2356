Annan Recommends U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Mission Renewal 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday recommended the renewal of the
mandate of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM)
for a further period time of six months.
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said the situation along the
border between Iraq and Kuwait "remained generally quiet " during the
reporting period form March 31 to September 21.
Annan said, "UNIKOM continued to carry out its tasks smoothly, thereby
contributing to the maintenance of calm and stability along the
border."
"In undertaking these tasks, it continued to receive the cooperation of
the Iraqi and Kuwaiti authorities," the U.N. chief said.
The mission, established after the 1991 Gulf War, was to monitor a
demilitarized zone on either side of the Kuwait-Iraq border.
The mission has 195 military observers and a 755-member infantry
battalion as well as a helicopter unit.
