Chirac backs Japan bid for Expo site 
French President Jacques Chirac pledged his support Tuesday for a
Japanese bid to host the 2005 World's Fair, for which it is competing
against a Canadian rival, officials said.
Chirac made the promise during a visit by a Japanese business
delegation to France, and ahead of a scheduled trip to Japan later this
year, probably in November, his press service said.
Aichi in Japan is bidding to host the World's Fair, as is Calgary
supported by the Canadian government. A decision on the 2005 site is
due to be made in mid-1997.
Relations between France and Japan were strained until early this year
by Chirac's decision to carry out a series of nuclear tests in the
South Pacific. The Japanese delegation Tuesday passed on a "message of
friendship" from Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
