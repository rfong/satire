Saddam Calls on Iraqi Army to Resist US Aggression 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today called upon the Iraqi Armed Forces
to resist against U.S. aggression by attacking the planes of the
"aggressors" which violate its airspace.
The Iraqi president also announced that Iraq on longer recognizes the
no-fly zones imposed by the United Nations in the south and north of
the country.
This came after U.S. cruise missiles attacked what Washington termed as
"selected military targets" in Iraq this morning.
In a televised national address, Saddam said that most of the cruise
missiles the U.S. launched against the Iraqi areas at about 9:00 a.m.
(local time) this morning were shot down and destroyed. The attack
caused only minor damages, he added.
The Iraqi president described the U.S. missile attacks as a cowardly
act, saying that that the Iraqi government and people "are steadfast
and firm and as strong as reinforced pillars which cannot be moved by
the wind of evil."
He said that as from today Iraq does not recognize the no-fly zones in
both south and north of the country.
"Right from now, (we) consider their damned vague lines north of 36
parallel and south of 32 parallel as canceled and (there are) no more
existing," he said, adding that the Iraqis will hit with efficiency any
target of the aggressors' planes which violate the airspace of Iraq.
Following the news of the U.S. missile attack, the Iraqi capital of
Baghdad remained calm and the traffic was normal. No extraordinary
measures have been seen here to prevent any possible panic or chaos
among the inhabitants.
