Wall Street Stocks Rise on Technology 
Wall Street stocks rose on the strength of technology Wednesday amid
reports on the surge of prices for manufacturing supplies and a rise in
spending on construction projects.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 9.62 at 10,137.93, expanding
its gains in the previous two sessions after falling below the 10,000
mark last Friday.
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 87.39 at 4,784.08, surpassing the record closing
high of 4,696.69 set Tuesday and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
rose 12.77 at 1,379.19.
The market rallied as investors rushed in to buy stocks from
telecommunications and technology companies. Lucent Technology rose
after announcing its plan to spin off the units that sell corporate
phone systems and maker wire cabling for office networks.
Other tech companies such as 3Com, Sun Microsystems and SBC
communications were also higher.
The enthusiasm for technology stocks eased investors' concerns about
higher interest rates. New data suggest that the Federal Reserve would
probably raise interest rates again to keep inflation under control.
The National Association of Purchasing management reported that the
prices paid for manufacturing supplies rose to a new five-year high
while the Commerce Department said spending on construction projects
jumped by 2.7 percent in January, the biggest increase in nearly two
years.
The Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since last June in an
effort to cool off the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan warned recently that more rate hikes will be likely if
the robust economy and hot stock market will not cool off quickly.
The NYSE index rose 6.84 at 599.48 and the American Stock Exchange
index rose 28.72 at 1,001.95. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 10.64 at 588.35.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,579 up, 1,497 down and 437 unchanged.
NYSE volume increased to 1.26 billion shares from 1.18 billion in the
previous session.
