Moscow Mayor Seriously Injured In Car Crash 
Yuri Luzhkov, the feisty mayor of Moscow, was seriously injured in a
car crash Thursday while traveling to his office in the center of the
Russian capital, an official said.
Igor Zverev, a deputy spokesman for the mayor, confirmed a news report
that Luzkhov was hurt Thursday morning while on his way to work.
Luzhov suffered serious injuries to the bridge of his nose and one of
his knees after his Volga sedan was struck by a smaller Zhiguli, the
Interfax news agency reported.
The mayor's chauffeur-driven car was traveling about 60 kilometers (37
miles) an hour and was approaching a traffic light when the Zhiguli
illegally crossed a double-white line and smashed into Luzhkov's
vehicle.
The mayor's driver braked but was unable to avoid a crash.
Luzhkov was traveling to downtown Moscow from Vnukovo airport, where he
had bid farewell to President Boris Yeltsin, who left for the Russian
city of Lipetsk to visit a factory.
