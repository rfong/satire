Chronology of ill-fated TWA flight 800 
Here is the timeline of TWA's flight 800, en route to Paris from New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport, which crashed and killed all 230 on
board.
- 5 p.m. (2100 GMT): The TWA Boeing 747-100 arrives at JFK from Athens.
A faulty engine pressure gauge is changed.
- 7 p.m. (2300 GMT): This is the scheduled takeoff time for flight 800
to Paris, but two events delayed the departure. A bag is pulled from
the cargo hold because the passenger was not on the plane. The
passenger finally arrives and the bag is again loaded aboard.
Also, a mechanical baggage loader breaks down and is pulled off the
runaway, clearing the jet for departure.
- 8:02 p.m. (0002 GMT): An hour late, the Boeing 747, with 212
passengers and 18 crew members, leaves the gate and heads toward runway
22R.
- 8:19 p.m. (0019 GMT): The plane takes off, heading southwest. Weather
conditions are good, and night has not yet fallen, so the pilot does
not need instruments to fly. At 250 meters (800 feet) of altitude, air
control is transferred to radar control in Westbury, New York (TRACON).
- 8:25 p.m. (0025 GMT): At about 2,300 meters (7,000 feet), Boston
(Massachusetts) assumes air control of flight 800 as it continues to
climb.
- 8:31 p.m. (0031 GMT): At 4,500 meters (13,700 feet), some 32
kilometers (20 miles) south of Islip, Long Island and 64 kilometers (40
miles) from the airport, flight 800 disappears from the radar screens.
The jet sends out no distress signal.
- 8:33 p.m. (0033 GMT): US Coast Guard begins receiving calls from
eyewitnesses who report having seen an explosion in the sky and a plane
fall into the ocean.
- 9:09 p.m. (0109 GMT): A Coast Guard boat reaches wreckage in the
ocean.
- 9:24 p.m. (2124 GMT): The first body is pulled from the water.
