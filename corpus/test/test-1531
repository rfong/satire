However, it said the Israeli representative on the committee "expressed
sorrow for the injuries and damage, but maintained they were an unintended
result of defensive counterfire" following an attack by Hezbollah
guerrillas.
The representative said Israel had "responded in a proportionate and
restrained manner."
The Lebanese and Syrian delegates however held that the shelling was
deliberate and voiced concern that the Israeli artillery action was
aimed at raising tension to prepare the ground for a wider military
operation.
The Israeli representative denied such intentions.
A Lebanese official said the Lebanese and Syrian members had called for
a condemnation of the Israeli action, but the move was resisted by the
Israeli side which insisted the committee was not a court and could not
apportion blame.
Israel initially justified Friday's shelling by saying Hezbollah
violated the truce first by firing mortars from inside a civilian area.
But it later acknowledged that the source of fire was "from the edges"
of a village.
