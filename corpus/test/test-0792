Search for survivors of ferry wreck resumes 
Air search operations for survivors or bodies from the sinking of the
car ferry Estonia resumed at dawn Thursday, but with little hope of
finding any of the 766 missing still alive.
Coastguards said only half the 20 helicopters that took part in
Wednesday's rescue operations would be deployed.
They said that no one had been found by ships overnight and that the
number of survivors was unchanged at 140. A total of 58 bodies have
been picked up.
Coastguards planned Thursday to lower a camera to the wreck of the
ferry on the bed of the Baltic 100 kilometres (62 miles) off southwest
Finland.
The Estonia sank in five minutes in a gale in the early hours of
Wednesday while on a passage from Tallinn to Stockholm. The cause of
the tragedy has not yet been determined.
