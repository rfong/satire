US to help South Africa fight Nigerian heroin trade
The US Drug Enforcement Administration plans to help South Africa combat
Nigerian drug traffickers who are trying to establish a South African
pipeline for Asian heroin, the New York Times reported Tuesday.
DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine told the Times he would visit
South Africa in January to discuss the arrangements with the
governmnent of President Nelson Mandela, which requested the help.
Constantine said he wanted to establish an office in Johannesburg in
order to provide technical aid to South African authorities. Currently
the DEA merely monitors drug trafficking in Africa from an office in
Cairo.
"We can put people in there," Constantine told the newspaper. "We can
give South African narcotics authorities access to virtually all our
information."
Constantine said there has been "nothing significant" yet in the way of
heroin shipments to the United States via South Africa.
However, he noted that South African authorities have fretted over an
influx of up to 50,000 Nigerian immigrants -- some of them notorious
heroin traffickers -- into the country.
Since the dismantling of the apartheid system in South Africa, the
tight immigration policy that kept most other Africans out has become
more liberal, and thousands have rushed into the country looking for
opportunity.
Lee P. Brown, former head of the White House drug-control office,
warned after a trip to Nigeria and South Africa in September that South
Africa "has the potenial of becoming a significant transit country for
Southeast Asian heroin en route to the United States."
He said traffickers were "taking advantage of the country's new
openness to transit drugs through its poorly controlled borders, air
and sea ports."
