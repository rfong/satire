Government ready to proclaim Misuari winner 
The government Commission on Elections (Comelec) is preparing to
proclaim former Moslem insurgent chief Nur Misuari winner of a regional
election in the southern Philippines, Comelec director Ressurecion
Borra said here Wednesday.
Misuari could be declared winner by Wednesday afternoon, Borra said,
after results of the elections in the Autonomous Region for Moslem
Mindanao are consolidated.
Misuari, who heads the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), ran
unopposed for governor of the four-province autonomous region on Monday
as part of a peace agreement he signed with the government last week.
As sole candidate, he needs only a single vote to win, but Comelec said
partial results showed voters had cast large numbers of votes for him.
No figures were provided.
As part of the peace agreement, which ended 24 years of bloody struggle
with the MNLF, Misuari is also likely to be appointed head of an
MNLF-led council that will oversee development projects in 14 provinces
of the southern island of Mindanao and its nearby islands.
The peace agreement has been opposed by Christians who make up the
majority in the southern Philippines and who fear that the agreement
will allow the Moslem minority to dominate.
