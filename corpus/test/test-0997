Mechanic-turned-midwife gets lesson in body work 
Swedish auto mechanic Magnus Graabo thought he knew everything about
cars, but now he can add another type of "body work" to his list:
delivering a baby in a Toyota Corolla.
Graabo's girlfriend Camilla went into labour five weeks early on
January 6. Twenty minutes into the car ride to the hospital, the couple
realized they were not going to make it in time.
Graabo used his cellular phone to call for emergency help, but the
batteries went dead and he had to act as midwife. He pulled over to the
side of the road and helped deliver their new son.
"Both Camilla and I compete in rallycross. That our child would be born
in our car was almost self-evident," Graabo said.
