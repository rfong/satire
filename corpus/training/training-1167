Iraq Urges Security Council to Stop U.S., British 
Iraq called on the United Nations Security Council to take a clear and
unambiguous position on the U.S. and British aggression.
In a letter to the Security Council which is circulated here Wednesday,
Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq, said "On
April 2, 1999, United States and United Kingdom aircraft destroyed
Iraq's main oil pumping station which serves the Mina al-Bakr oil
terminal."
Sahaf said the two countries aimed to interrupt the pumping of oil and
hamper the application of the memorandum of understanding concerning
the oil-for-food program.
U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq's targets have become common
since last December when Iraq began to challenge western warplane
patrols over its territory.
