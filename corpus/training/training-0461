Arrival in Zagreb of 120 freed UN peacekeepers 
The 120 UN peacekeepers freed overnight after being held hostage by
Bosnian Serbs arrived late Saturday at Zagreb airport, an AFP
correspondent said here.
A first UN aircraft, which had left the Croatian capital earlier to
pick up the peacekeepers from Belgrade, landed at Zagreb-Pleso airport
at 19:30 (17:30 GMT), and a second aircraft arrived minutes later.
Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia, was among those
who greeted the peacekeepers, who were led away to UN offices at the
airport.
Chinmaya Gharekhan, adviser to UN Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, who was sent to Zagreb Saturday to investigate the
hostage-taking, was also present.
The UN troops were released overnight by their captors, who are still
holding some 250 other UN troops taken after NATO airstrikes against
Bosnian Serb positions. The airstrikes had been ordered in retaliation
for Bosnian Serb shelling of Sarajevo despite a ban of heavy weapons
within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the Bosnian capital.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has claimed credit for the release
of the 120 UN troops, and said Saturday the remaining captive
peacekeepers would be released soon.
The 120 -- 11 British, 42 Canadian and 63 French troops and UN military
observers from Denmark, Finland, Nepal and Sweden -- had stayed
Saturday at a hotel in Novi Sad, a town to the northwest of the Serbian
capital Belgrade.
Following the hostage-taking, defence ministers from countries in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the European Union decided
Saturday in Paris to create a rapid reaction force of between 4,000 and
5,000 men in Bosnia on a Franco-British initiative.
