ADB Asks Dhaka to Prioritize Projects 
The Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB) has indicated that it
would lend 625 million U.S. dollars for 1998 and 1999 to Bangladesh,
but asked for carefully prioritizing the projects in view of limited
available resources, according to local sources today.
The ADB's country program confirmation mission, which visited Dhaka
recently, held preliminary discussions with the government about the
1998-2000 programs including a list of new proposals submitted by
different ministries.
While pledging continued assistance to Bangladesh, the bank indicated
that there is need to maintain an even balance between economic growth
and social, poverty, environment oriented projects during the next
programming cycle.
The bank said the indicated planning figures for 1998 and 1999 would
amount to 300 million and 325 million dollars respectively.
The donor agency will make new lending in six projects in
infrastructure and social sectors. The areas are agriculture,
infrastructure, energy, education, urban development and environment
protection sectors.
The ADB's total lending to this country amounts to 4.51 billion dollars
upto December 1997 for 117 loans and its total grant in the form of
technical assistance to 105.47 million dollars for 209 projects.
