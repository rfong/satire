Karzai and ISAF chief discuss security in run-up to Loya Jirga
Interim leader Hamid Karzai and the head of the multinational security
force patrolling Kabul held talks Tuesday on security in the lead-up to
an Afghan grand assembly next month which will select a new government.
"We discussed preparation that is underway for the Loya Jirga," Karzai
told reporters after his meeting with General John McColl, commander of
the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah warned reporters last month that the
"forces of darkness" opposed to the Loya Jirga assembly and
post-Taliban political era could try to disrupt the process.
Representatives from the interim administration, ISAF and the United
Nations are to meet in Kabul in the next few days to discuss security
issues ahead of the assembly which is due to start on June 10, said
ISAF spokesman Flight Lieutenant Jol Fall.
Karzai emphasised that he wanted ISAF to remain in Kabul until Afghan
authorities were in a position to deal with security on their own.
"The ISAF mandate should be extended for as long as it is needed in
Afghanistan," said Karzai.
"I cannot tell you right now how long that need will be and how quickly
we can raise our own security and military forces."
The Afghan leader has repeatedly pushed for ISAF's mandate to be
extended beyond Kabul but his demands have been rebuffed by the
international community.
After the talks in McColl's offices, the ISAF commander showed Karzai
around the force's main compound in central Kabul and introduced him to
some of the troops from the 19 countries which make up the force.
Turkey is due to take over the leadership of the 4,600-strong force
from Britain next month in the lead-up to the Loya Jirga but no
decision has yet been made on how long the force will continue its
duties beyond that.
The multinational force began patrolling Kabul in December in the
aftermath of the Bonn conference which paved the way for the
installation of the interim government.
