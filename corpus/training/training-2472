Ugandan President to Meet Mbeki on DRC Issue 
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni will visit South Africa this weekend
for talks with his South African counterpart, Thabo Mbeki, on the
situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Foreign
Affairs Department announced Thursday.
The department's deputy director-general for Africa Welile Nhlapo told
reporters in Pretoria that it was necessary for Mbeki and Museveni to
exchange views
Museveni, Mbeki and the presidents of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, and
Tanzania, Benjamin Mokapa, met last year to discuss the DRC issue and
reached certain agreements in terms of a plan for the disengagement of
fighting groups in the Congo. A few days later fighting again flared up
in the Kisangani area.
Mbeki had been in contact with the three presidents to try and find the
best way to get all sides to adhere to the agreements, Nhlapo said.
The United Nations Organization Mission in the DRC (MONUC) was asked to
help since "the plan was not necessarily totally adhered to," Nhlapo
said.
