Denard's rebels "not in control": charge d'affaires 
The charge d'affaires for the Comoros islands said here Friday that
rebels led by veteran French mercenary Bob Denard were not totally in
control of the Indian Ocean archipelago following their coup bid.
Kamal Abdul Wahab told AFP that Denard and his putschists "were not in
control of the whole situation" and "are occupying only the building of
Radio Comoros and the Kandani military camp.
"All the rest is disinformation," Wahab said.
Friday morning, the rebels said on state radio that their coup against
the government of the former French colony had been victorious and that
they were forming a "temporary" military junta.
They said that forces loyal to President Said Mohamed Djohar, seized
Thursday when the putsch was launched, had ceased all resistance.
