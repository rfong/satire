Chicago Aldermen To Oversee Iraq Voting
Chicago Aldermen, representing every Ward from that city, are in Iraq to
observe and certify tomorrow's Iraqi national voting.  Lazlo Javic told
this reporter "We're the ones who perfected dead people voting, and Iraq is
the perfect place with all the dead people around here." He added that he
hoped a candidate named Jamal bin Daley would win. Javic then added, "I'm
sure he will."
Javic said he and the rest of the other Aldermen would stay in Iraq
until they had finished counting the ballots. "Then we're going to buy
that bin Daley a dark navy blue suit and a pair of wingtips. Those
sandals look like hell."
Javic complained that restaurants in Iraq do not serve pork chops.
"They keep kosher like the Jews. Although, I know a Jewish guy in
Skokie who eats them." Javic also complained about all the potholes on
the airport runways and city streets. "When that bin Daley gets in,
this will all get fixed - or else. We have some paving contractors in
Cook County lined up."
When asked about concerns for their personal safety, Javic said "No one
messes with Colucci." He noted that "when Colucci and his guys are
around, everyone looks the other way. That's the way they should have
done it at the beginning,ya know."
Javic said that when they go back to Chicago, they're taking bin Daley
with them, "to give him a crash course on running an office. Then,
we'll send him back with some of our guys."
Javic said he liked the ballot boxes and red ink on voter's fingers.
"We should have thought that up in Cook County years ago. It's so much
easier than the way we've been doing it since before 1900." He noted
how it compared with voter registration cards, showing a photo ID and
finagling with mechanical voting machines.
Javic also noted with pride that "Colucci's boys don't get hassled in
Baghdad about carrying pistols with silencers. Hell, they even took
them on the plane here. That bin Daley has a lot to learn."
Javic said he hopes to make regular visits to bin Daley's Baghdad
office. "I'm sure he'll remember who made all of this possible."
