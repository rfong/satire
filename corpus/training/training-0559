Edward Van Thijn of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) said Saturday's poll "was well prepared and carried out
successfully under difficult circumstances."
There had been "no major irregularities," he said, but expressed
concern over problems with voter registration, freedom of movement and
the pre-election campaign.
His comments, which did not contradict the upbeat assessments from the
international community, came as evidence emerged of abuses and
vote-stacking, particularly in Serb areas of Bosnia.
Independent monitors said Serbs were bused into Bosnia to vote in
strategic towns in a bid to tip the ethnic balance in their favour.
Poor polling day organistion for those wishing to vote in the
neighbourhoods they were expelled from by Serb extremists had
discouraged many thousands, the international monitoring group headed
by former US congressman George Mitchell, ICG, reported.
Some election observers were worried by the early results, which they
saw as cementing the de facto division of Bosnia, whose first post-war
election were designed to help reunited a country divided by war.
The Dayton peace accords for Bosnia recognised the wartime division of
the country but attempted to bring the opposing sides together under a
weak joint presidency. Saturday's elections, however, seem set to
return to power the very people who led the country into Europe's
bloodiest conflict in 50 years.
