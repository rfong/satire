Kazakhstan president makes official visit to Indonesia 
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev was due in Indonesia Thursday
for his first official visit, repaying one here in April by President
Suharto.
Nazarbayev is accompanied on the four-day trip with Foreign Minister
Kassimzhomart Tokayev, heads of regional administrations and
businessmen.
During his visit to Kazakhstan on a tour which also took in Uzbekistan
and Turkmenistan, Suharto and Nazarbayev signed a declaration pledging
to deepen relations.
Agreements were also concluded on scientific and technical cooperation,
which are expected to be followed up in Jakarta.
Nazarbayev adviser Constantin Zhigalov also said there would be accords
between the two countries' central banks and chambers of commerce.
Indonesia has no embassy in Kazakhstan and economic relations are
recent and low, amounting to no more than one million dollars annually,
including imports of Indonesian tea.
By contrast, trade between Indonesia and Uzbekistan totals 100 million
dollars a year.
