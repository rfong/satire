Thailand to Expand Higher Education Via Cable 
Thailand will launch a nationwide program to provide higher education
through optical fiber cable systems, the local press reported today.
The program is expected to cover some 300,000 people, excluding state
university students, in 30 provinces by 2002.
Under the program sponsored by the Ministry of University Affairs, at
least one such "cable campus" will be created in each province by 2006
and more than 560,000 people nationwide will have the opportunity to
enroll for a bachelor's degree.
According to the ministry, students on the campuses could have direct
dialogues with lecturers or professors at state universities through
interactive cable networks and each state university will send its test
papers via cable systems to students sitting for exams on the campuses.
The Thai cabinet has approved the ministry's program and the ministry
is expected to set up cable campuses in seven provinces this year to
provide higher education for 150,000 students.
