``/`` As/IN attorney/NN general/NN ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN to/TO do/VB something/NN about/IN this/DT absence/NN of/IN civility/NN ,/, ''/'' It/PRP was/VBD classic/JJ Karen/NNP Burstein/NNP :/: brash/JJ ,/, funny/JJ and/CC unconventional/JJ ,/, a/DT smart/JJ skepticism/NN combined/VBN with/IN an/DT abiding/JJ belief/NN that/IN government/NN can/MD make/VB people/NNS better/RBR ./.
