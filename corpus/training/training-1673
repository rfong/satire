VECO standing by for yet another Exxon Valdez disaster as tanker runs
aground off NYC
Oil industry graft specialist VECO was standing by for an emergency
clean-up operation opportunity today as the New York Port Authority and
Coast Guard were placed on maximum alert for yet another potential Exxon
Valdez disater as an oil tanker, The White Sea, carrying nearly 20 million
gallons of fuel grounded off New York City.
The vessel ran aground after losing streerage in an incident not that
dissimilar to May's Alaskan grounding of the Empress of the North
pleasure steamer.
Port authorities were quick to prepare for yet another potential
massive eco disaster as Coast Guard assessed the emergency in New
Jersey's Sandy Hook area early this morning.
The double-hulled vessel appeared to be firmly wedged into a sandbank
as tugs attempted to free her and crew members deployed spill booms in
a damage limitation exercise.
VECO honed its graft skills during a disastrous botch job covering up
the Exxon Valdez catastrophe and has progressed ever since by hiring
corrupt Alaskan legislators to act as its pimps in the US oil industry.
Further details about the White Sea's grounding are exepcted later.
