Beer festival breaks records: 
The 1995 Munich Beer Festival smashed its attendance records with 6.7
million visitors in 16 days, organisers said Sunday.
Right up until the last day on Sunday the tents at one of the world's
most popular festivals were full.
There were 15.7 percent more revellers sitting on the wooden benches
and singing the traditional rowdy drinking songs arm in arm or in back
and thigh slapping bonhomie.
Yet although 4.8 million litres of beer were guzzled, consumption only
rose by 3.4 percent, organisers said.
The extra attendance was attributed to the three Bundesliga football
matches and demonstration rallies.
The flipside of the success came with tankards disappearing in their
thousands. However further proof of the festival's success came
courtesy of the 500,000 people who consulted the information
noticeboard set up on the Internet for the event.
