Police warn students not to march 
The Serbian police warned Belgrade students on Thursday not to proceed
with their daily protest march through the capital, two days after
violent clashes between rival demonstrators led to the death of an
opposition supporter.
Miloje Nikolic, police chief of the old town area in Belgrade where the
protests take place, issued to warning to an official in charge of
security at the students' protest.
"I'm here to send you a serious warning that all further walks and
gatherings are forbidden," he told the official in the presence of an
AFP journalist.
A police statement Wednesday said that the protests were disrupting
traffic, and threatened police intervention.
Tens of thousands of Belgrade university students have been
demonstrating daily in protest at the authorities' refusal to accept
November 17 local election results, which saw the opposition Together
coalition win 15 out of 18 major towns and cities.
The students' demonstration usually begins a few hours before the
protests organised by Together, which start at 3:00 p.m. (1400 GMT).
