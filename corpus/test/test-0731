'Perfect' first flight for Airbus, But Putin Sells Nukes Variation To Syria To Attack US?
The world's biggest nuclear missile manufacture and their first line
product, the European Airbus system A380, has been sold to Syria.
Putin, the Russian sales agent is expected to get a megaton bonus this
year for closing the deal in Israel today. Software sales engineers are
known to be ruthless, but the latest deal has shocked the World and
Putin is no exception in targeting his bonus
Syria, has flown the latest system for the first time today.
Unfortunately, for U.S. rival Boeing Inc, the Putin system sold and
delivered can direct 560 tons against the US compared to the mediocre
461 tons of the Boeing system. Initially, the European system was
perceived to be for delivering weekend shoppers to Israel from Syria
but now the details of the system delivered have made a mockery of the
Western World. It seems that Putin has used his inside knowledge of the
software engineering World to confuse his Supreme commanders.
He had promised to meet his quarterly and annual democracy sales
targets demanded by Mrs Condoleeza Rice-Putin and there is no doubt
that he has achieved those software sales - unfortunately, in order to
meet those objectives, he has been economical with the truth and he has
added a few tons of nuclear grade material plus the new European
Aircraft to sweeten the software deal. Ruthless, even insidious
software dealers and insiders have been shocked by the deal.
President Bush has sponsored US Boeing to the limit on the much smaller
787 Dream-in-the-sky-liner which may be due in 2008 and has won future
orders for operation in the whole World but has yet to have had the
same level of subsidies as in Europe, unfortunately he has blown his
sales budget on mass distribution engineers into the Middle Eastern
countries such as Iraq without the software engineering required.
Israel has many shopping centers that will suffer badly by this latest
software deal. The new flight system will be capable of a day quick
trip to New York, USA or Sidney, Australia and worse still requires a
runway that is actually longer than the distance from Syria to Israel.
This means that local targets will be ignored and of no interest in the
new commercial agreement.
Software Sales Executive Putin confirmed to Israel "The only way you
can ever come into contact with these software systems and the aircraft
that fly like missiles to their shopping centers would be to attack
Syria. Do you want to do ever miss that?''
