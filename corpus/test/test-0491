Balladur popularity soars as Delors keeps own counsel 
The popularity of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur reached a new
high in August with 63 percent of the electorate happy with his
performance, according to an opinion poll published Sunday.
The rise of five points in the monthly IFOP poll carried out for the
Journal du Dimanche made Balladur the most popular premier since the
poll began in February 1959, with an average of 53.4 percent since his
appointment in April last year.
The news will be a blow to mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac, expected to
be Balladur's rival in the battle to win the endorsement of the
right-wing coalition parties for their candidate in next May's
presidential election.
It was also expected to add spice to this weekend's meeting of
socialists of the Temoin (Witness) faction headed by outgoing European
Commission president Jacques Delors.
Delors, who steps down as the European Union's chief official at the
end of this year, is under pressure to declare himself ready to be the
socialist candidate to succeed President Francois Mitterrand.
He is seen as the only socialist likely to win the election, but, like
Balladur, says he will make no statement before January.
Delors arrived for the Temoin conference in Lorient, Brittany,
Saturday, but it was uncertain if he would even address it, let alone
give any hint as to his intentions.
Temoin chairman Francois Hollande told the television channel France 2
late Saturday that Delors would be prompted to run for president only
if the right's candidate seriously threatened European unity or social
democracy.
