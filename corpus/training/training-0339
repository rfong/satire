China plays a vital role in maintaining the regional and world peace
and stability, said Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto here today.
During a meeting with the visiting Commander of the Chinese Navy, Zhang

always wants to solve disputes through peaceful means.
She greatly appreciated the achievements made by China, saying that
China's development shows the intelligence of the Chinese leadership
and the diligence of the people.
During the 30-minute meeting, Benazir recalled the cordial relations
between the two countries, saying that China is the most trusted friend
of Pakistan and has helped it in difficult times.
She stressed that to develop the time-tested relations with China is
the corner stone of Pakistan's foreign policy.
The prime minister said that no matter what may happen in the
international arena in the future, the Pak-China friendship, developed
by the leaders of the older generation of the two countries, will
remain the same.
This friendship, she said, is also reflected in the relations between
the armed forces of the two countries, which have been cooperating
successfully in various fields.

importance to the strengthening and development of the Sino-Pak
friendship.
During the meeting, the Chinese naval commander also briefed the prime

Friday on a five-day visit at the invitation of Mansoor ul Haq, chief
of Pakistan's naval staff. The Chinese delegation will also visit
Karachi before leaving for home on July 3.
