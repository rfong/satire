Communists win Tajikistan poll 
Communists emerged as the largest party in Tajikistan's new parliament
after the second round of voting in legislative elections, according to
official results published Monday.
The only opposition deputies elected were two members of the Tajik
People's Unity Party, supporters of former president Abdumalik
Abdulajanov who stood against the advice of their party, which had
called for a boycott of the poll.
Sixty Communist party members, supporters of the neo-communist
president Emomali Rakhomonov, form the largest single group in the
181-seat assembly of the central Asian republic after the second round
poll in 19 constituencies.
Turnout in the Sunday poll totalled 69.6 percent, following a first
round of voting on February 26, officials said, quoted by the ITAR-TASS
news agency.
The new assembly will also comprise around 60 regional barons, the
heads of collective farms or of local administrations, mostly from the
Kulyab region and opponents of the Islamic rebellion that has riven the
country for the past two years, and supporters of Rakhmonov.
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, along with the
United Nations and the European Union, had refused to send observers to
monitor the poll which it considered insufficiently democratic.
The armed Islamic opposition, based in Afghanistan where it fled after
being forced from power in December 1992, also boycotted the poll.
Rakhmonov, a former parliamentary president, was elected head of state
last autumn.
