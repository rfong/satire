Violence Costs Colombia 1 Billion U.S. Dollars Each Year 
Violence in the past four years have cost Colombia nearly 1 billion
U.S. dollars in economic losses each year, said a study report
available today.
The study, conducted by a group of experts headed by Jesus Antonio
Bejarano, economist and former presidential advisor, said that 500
businessmen kidnapped last year had to pay ransoms totaling 75 billion
pesos (about 75 million dollars) for their freedom.
Farmers and cattlemen, the favorite target of bandits, had to pay 40
billion pesos (about 40 million dollars) while cattle rustling led to
losses of 6 billion pesos (about 6 million dollars).
The study said nearly 30,000 people were killed in violence this year.
Giving the levels of violence and danger, the experts estimated that
322 municipalities are in a "critical" situation and Caldas, Quindio
and Risaralda enjoy the highest crime rates.
Colombia's crime rate is four times higher than that of Ecuador or
Venezuela, three times higher than Brazil and Mexico.
There have been 10,000 kidnappings in Colombia in the last decade.
