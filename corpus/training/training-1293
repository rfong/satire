Sweden's central bank raises key rate by 0.25 pct points 
Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, raised its key "repo" rate by 0.25
percentage points on Tuesday, to 4.00 percent.
The rate hike was largely expected, following recent statements by
Riksbank officials about concern for rising inflation.
The repo rate was last changed on September 17, one week after the
terror attacks in the United States, when Sweden followed the US
Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank and cut the rate by 0.50
percentage points.
