Kenya to Boost Pyrethrum Production This Year 
The Pyrethrum Board of Kenya will distribute five million seedlings to
farmers this year to boost pyrethrum production, compared with three
million seedlings last year.
According to the 1997 Pyrethrum Growers Bulletin, the board has raised
five million seedlings in its nurseries ready for distribution to the
farmers for the 1997 planting season beginning from March.
In last year's growing season, a total of three million seedlings and
3,875 kilograms of seed were distributed, the bulletin said.
It noted that the steady increase of demand for pyrethrum worldwide has
called for new measures to expand the area under the crop.
Starting last year, it added, many farmers in the east African country
have shown great interest in pyrethrum growing as the board pays
attractive prices to the farmers.
Pyrethrum products have become popular in recent years after it was
established by researchers that pyrethrins are practically
non-poisonous to mammals, having shown a rapid breakdown with no
residues in the environment and little build-up of resistance in insect
populations.
Because of the increasing consciousness of the risks associated with
widespread use of synthetic insecticides, the demand for pyrethrum
products has continued to increase in recent years.
The current annual demand for pyrethrum in the world market stands at
about 20,000 tons of dried flowers, of which Kenya produces about 50
percent, with Tanzania, Australia, Rwanda and Papua New Guinea
supplying the rest.
Kenya exports an average 9,000 tons of dried pyrethrum flowers
annually, which is an important foreign exchange earner in the east
African country.
