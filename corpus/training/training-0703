SKorean president's son says he won't run for office
The second son of South Korean President Kim Young-Sam, Kim Hyun-Chul, said
on Monday that he would not run for public office -- at least while his
father was president, Yonhap news agency reported.
"I won't run in the coming (April) general elections nor would I seek
any other appointed or elected office at least until my father's term
expires," Yonhap quoted Kim Hyun-Chul as saying.
"At the moment I am little interested in politics," the junior Kim was
quoted as saying.
The agency said the comments were made in the context of speculation
that Kim Hyun-Chul might take a seat in the National Assembly through a
by-election in Koje if his father's party's chosen candidate for that
constituency were given a government post after the April polls.
The president has given his backing to the jailing and trials of two
former ex-presidents, Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo, accused of massive
corruption while in office from 1980 to 1993.
Prosecutors say that between them, the two former
generals-turned-presidents milked big business of some 1.5 billion
dollars.
The senior Kim, the country's first dissident-turned-president, has
said he too may have benefitted from black money in his campaign, but
swears he has not touched a penny since taking office.
Kim Hyun-Chul last month was awarded recorded damages of 520,000
dollars against the independent Hankyoreh Daily after it alleged he had
received 100 million won (130,000 dollars) from a lobbyist before the
1993 presidential polls in which his father was elected.
