East China's Economic Giant Protects Groundwater 
Exploitation of groundwater will be banned in three cities -- Suzhou,
Wuxi and Changzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province, according to a
recent code issued by the standing committee of the provincial people's
congress.
This is the first time China has made effort to protect its groundwater
resources by law, a local official source said.
According to the code, the exploitation of groundwater in the three
cities, all with rapid economic growth, will be limited gradually in
the coming three years, and by the end of 2005, no groundwater will be
allowed to be used.
By 2005, the use of groundwater will be completely substituted by
surface water resources, according to the code.
"Violating enterprises would be fined and ordered to stop production,"
it said.
Local officials said that the excessive exploitation of groundwater has
resulted from soaring water demand as the economy has grown rapidly in
recent years.
Scientific figures show that the ground-level in the three cities is
sinking at an average rate of six to ten centimeters each year. In some
areas in Suzhou, the figure is as high as 160 centimeters, damaging the
local buildings, infrastructure, rivers and dykes.
