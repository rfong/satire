US report into Swiss banks' wartime dealings set for release
A seven-month US enquiry to shed light on the wartime dealings of Swiss
banks comes to a close with the release Wednesday of a keenly awaited
report expected to be harshly critical of Switzerland.
The release of the review to which 11 agencies have contributed has
been repeatedly delayed after initial drafts failed to meet with the
approval of interested parties: Jewish groups, New York Senator Alfonse
D'Amato and allied governments.
"The report is going to be comprehensive, revealing and we feel very
constructive," commented an aide to Stuart Eizenstat, the commerce
under secretary who was appointed last fall by President Bill Clinton
to coordinate the research effort.
The 200-page report, to be made public along with hundreds of
accompagnying archival documents, will review US diplomacy during the
war and post-war period, in particular Washington's dealings with the
Swiss government.
The findings will help the State Department determine, among other
issues, whether it will seek to re-negotiate a 1946 agreement on the
fate of Nazi gold deposited in Swiss banks.
Under that accord, Switzerland agreed to pay to the United States,
France and Britain 58 million dollars each in Nazi gold and a
tripartite commission was established to oversee the disbursement.
But the World Jewish Congress, which has spearheaded the drive for
Swiss accountability along with D'Amato, maintains that Swiss
authorities failed to disclose the full amount of gold in its
possession at the end of the war.
The US report is expected to estimate the value of Nazi gold in Swiss
banks at 800 million dollars, according to some press accounts here,
citing leaked documents.
Eizenstat on Saturday told Jewish groups in New York that the report
will also take a harsh look at Washington's post-war dealings, telling
them: "It pulls no punches."
The senior official was forced to examine whether funds deposited in US
banks by European Jews were illegally confiscated after he received a
letter from the chief US negotiator appointed to talks with the Swiss
on the looted gold.
Seymour Rubin told Eizenstat that some six million dollars in unclaimed
New York bank accounts may have belonged to Jews who died in the war.
After years of investigation, the US government decided to give 500,000
dollars -- a fraction of the full estimated sum -- from the deposits to
a Jewish restitution fund.
Despite the hoopla over the report, historians agree that the
seven-month enquiry will leave many questions unanswered about the
dealings of the Swiss banks and the controversy is expected to
continue.
Attention will continue to focus on a commission headed by former
Reserve Bank chairman Paul Volcker that is investigating claims that
Swiss banks pocketed funds deposited by Jews who died in the war.
But the report may open a new chapter in Washington's relations with
Bern, which has complained of being unfairly singled out by the United
States for its wartime dealings.
Switzerland's ambassador to the United States, Carlo Jagmetti, was
forced to resign in January after outraging Jewish groups here for
writing a memo in which he likened that controversy over the Nazi gold
to a "war" that had to be won.
