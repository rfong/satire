Hungary Seeks Good Relations With Neighbors 
Hungary is capable of solving the disputes with its neighbors according
to the European values and standards and is willing to develop multiple
relations with them, said Hungarian Prime Minister Horn Gyula today.
In his letters to the leaders of Austria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Yugoslavia and Ukraine, Horn briefed them on the treaty signed on
Monday between Hungary and Romania.
The treaty, which caps five years of negotiations over the status of
Romania's 1.6 million ethnic Hungarians, is a precondition for the two
countries to join the EU and NATO.
Horn said the treaty is an important step in bringing about
reconciliation and strengthening cooperation between the two countries.
He said that Hungary can take concrete moves to forge deeper trust and
closer cooperation with all its neighbors without referring to their
historical wounds.
