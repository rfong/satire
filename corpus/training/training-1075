Army deployed in Beirut on eve of general strike 
Lebanese Army armored vehicles were deployed late Wednesday around
government buildings in Beirut on the eve of a general strike and
demonstration due to be carried out in defiance of an official ban.
The nationwide strike, called by the powerful General Confederation of
Lebanese Workers (CGTL), was banned by a decree issued in July 1995,
prohibiting public demonstrations.
The government also decided Wednesday to impose a ban on carrying arms
which only exempted official bodyguards.
The same measures were adopted for a general strike on February 29. The
army was put in charge of internal security for a three-month period
and imposed a curfew on the day itself.
Military sources said the decision to impose a curfew was an exclusive
political decision to be adopted by the council of ministers.
The third government of Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, formed after
parliamentary elections in August and September, was expected Wednesday
to win a vote of confidence in the house by a wide margin.
Elias Abu Rizk, head of the 150,000-strong CGTL, has reiterated his
determination to carry out the strike and demonstration to denounce the
social policies of Hariri's government and its "repression of public
freedom."
The strike is to be held two days before a government deadline for the
closure of 47 television and radio stations, under a new media law
passed on September 17.
More than 400 journalists and university students held a candle-lit
vigil in front of the parliament late Wednesday at the end of a
three-day sit-in to protest the new media law.
They say the law was aimed at muzzling the opposition by legalizing
only a few television and radio stations owned by pro-Syrian officials.
