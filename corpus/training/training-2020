EU, Sweden Fail to Narrow Difference on EU Expansion 
Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen and the EU Commissioner for
Foreign Relations Hans van den Broek failed Monday to overcome their
differences over the process of EU expansion, local reports said today.
Hjelm-Wallen insisted that the European Union (EU) hold negotiations on
EU membership with all the countries wishing to join EU.
He argued that the process of reform would be threatened in those
countries excluded from the first round of negotiations.
However, Broek said that only six countries would be allowed to attend
the first round of negotiations: Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus.
He said that if negotiations were attended by countries that were not
prepared for entry into the EU, disappointment would be rife among the
people of those countries since they would see little in the way of
positive results.
Broek, who is here for a meeting of the Conservative and Christian
Democratic parties in the European Parliament as well as a meeting with
Hjelm-Wallen on EU's future expansion, suggested a system under which
the countries wishing to join the EU could be bound more closely to the
organization through special programs.
