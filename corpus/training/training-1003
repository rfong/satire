The five countries are to set up an adminstrative office staffed by their
own representatives. Beijing is currently the favored site -- ahead of
Seoul and Vladivostok.
Announced in 1991, the Tumen River development project involved
ambitious plans to unlock the resource-rich region, long cut off from
world markets and investors, by opening up regional borders and
building major infrastructure projects, such as a new port at the river
mouth, 11 specialized harbors and a rail hub.
The regional zone covers an area of 200 square kilometres (80 square
miles), with a population of some 150 million people.
China's access to the Sea of Japan is blocked by a 20-kilometer
(12-mile) corridor at that point, where Russia and North Korea share a
coastline divided by the Tumen River.
The first phase of the TRADP consisted mostly of efforts to get the
participants to cooperate, and was hindered by the political tensions
and mistrust as well as the countries' desire to reap the economic
benefits of the planned bloc while making little financial
contribution.
Such problems forced the project's grand plan to be watered down last
year to focus on upgrading existing infrastructure and coordinating
regional development.
