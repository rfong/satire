Estrada Vows to Defend National Sovereignty 
Philippine President Joseph Estrada renewed Monday his commitment to
defend the nation's sovereignty even as he called on the Filipino
people to stand united against the bigger war of eradicating poverty in
the country.
In his speech at the main program and parade at Rizal Park in Manila
commemorating the 102nd anniversary of Philippine Independence, the
president expressed confidence that this goal can be achieved with the
support of the people.
"We commemorate the 102nd year of our independence today firm in the
conviction that we will overcome. We will face the challenges and we
will seize the opportunities that have been denied us in the past," the
president said.
According to the president, the nation today is facing obstacles to its
progress, including challenges to peace and order, the economy, and
territorial integrity.
Many of these problems, he noted, stemmed from decades of official
neglect, which his administration is trying to correct now.
But the biggest problem, the president said, is to have the Filipino
people unite behind the government as it works to address the causes of
poverty.
His administration, he said, will continue to pursue poverty
alleviation and to improve the quality of life of the people.
The president said he has placed the poor at the center of the
government's development efforts, and mobilized the entire government
machinery to implement this pro-poor agenda.
However, Estrada stressed that the government will not be intimidated
by groups out to sow terror and violence. "We will not be enslaved by
fear and intimidation," he said.
The president said he must fulfill his duty and lead the police and
military in defending the nation's sovereignty from all threats.
