Brazilian Judge awarded prize from Hitler Commemoration Institute
Julier Sebastiao da Silva, the Brazilian Federal judge who contended
that fingerprinting of particular foreigners travelling by air into the
United States recalled the "worst horrors committed by the Nazis," was
awarded the 2003 'Erriner Sich Der Fuhrer' award by the Hitler
Commemoration institute in a controversial decision Today.
Jimmy Breslin, an early favorite for his March 26 parallel of Bush and
Hitler's pre-war propaganda, bristled at the announcement. "Number 1,
this guy made the comparison on December 30, right under the wire. The
Institute should take into account that we had no chance to respond.
Number 2, it's not even a direct comparison. Lots of other Nazis
'committed horrors.' It's not even clear this guy should qualify."
The institute closes submissions every year at midnight of December 31.
Blogger Jonathan David Morris of AmericanDaily.com was nominated for
comparing Hillary Clinton in Hitler in a May 29 entry, the only nominee
this year to have not compared Hitler to US President George Walker
Bush.
Thanks to the American president's use of fear mongering and adoption
of the "politics is the new art" philosophy, Hitler comparisons have
been on a rapid rise. Institute Chairman Helmut Kopf says that's all to
the good.
"Not only does the keep the fuhrer's memory alive, but it moves the
focus away from the unfortunate pain some people suffered."
This is the 32nd year the awarded has been granted to a celebrity who
compared Hitler to a well known figure. Helen Chenoweth-Hage won the
award in 1999 for comparing Former US President William Jefferson
Clinton to Hitler; last year the award went to Iris Moshik, who
compared Yasser Arafat -- essentially a landless peasant with good
media access -- to Hitler in the Telegraph.
