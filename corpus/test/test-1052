The last words from American Eagle Flight 4184 to air traffic
controllers, spoken a minute before their plane rolled to the right,
flipped upside down and crashed last October near Roselawn, Ind., were
``Thank you.'' The pilots had just been told they would have to wait 10
minutes to be cleared to land.
A transcript of their conversation, released Monday by the Federal
Aviation Administration, shows air traffic controllers trying to get
the pilots to respond and asking pilots in the area about the weather,
which included heavy rain and sleet.
The transcript offered no clear indication of the cause of the crash,
which is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety
Board. The safety board said Monday that it would hold a hearing on the
crash on Feb. 27 in Indianapolis.
The crash was the third involving a plane made by Avions de Transport
Regional, a French-Italian consortium. The fourth accident occurred
Monday, when an ATR-72 crashed into a mountain south of Taipei, Taiwan,
during a training flight, killing four crew members.
ATR officials said that plane was flying at an altitude of about four
thousand feet when it crashed 12.5 miles from Taipei. The plane, flying
through drizzle, was about to overtake a slower plane, and was asked to
circle to put more distance between the two planes, said Kathryn
Creedy, an ATR spokeswoman. The temperature at the airport was above 55
degrees, she said.
In the Roselawn crash, the effect of icing on the plane's performance
is suspected of being a possible cause of the crash. The safety board
said that in the hearing it would also examine air traffic control,
weather and the aircraft's design and systems as possible factors in
the crash.
Safety board officials said yesterday that on the first day of the
hearing they planned to release a transcript of the pilots'
conversation in the cockpit before the crash.
In early December, the FAA banned the plane from flying in icing
conditions. The ban followed wind tunnel and runway taxi tests
monitored by the agency. In those tests, unusually shaped mockups of
ice buildup were placed on the wing and were found to disrupt roll
control.
On Jan. 11, the agency lifted the ban after ATR proposed a series of
short-term procedural changes and a longer-term solution that requires
the company to enlarge the de-icing system on the leading edge of the
wings.
The transcript released Monday shows that Flight 4184 first contacted
Chicago's radar control center at 3:13 p.m., reporting that its
altitude was 16,000 feet. Five minutes later, traffic controllers gave
the pilots a string of instructions, and the pilot flying the plane
said: ``Wow. That's a lot of numbers, but I think I got it.''
He accurately repeated them back to air traffic controllers, who
apologized for not warning the pilot beforehand about the lengthy
instructions.
``That's all right,'' the pilot responded. ``I just wrote all over my
arm.''
At 3:19 p.m., the pilot told controllers that he wanted to decrease
speed. ``We're gonna slow down out here if you don't mind,'' he said.
Safety board investigators said in November that Flight 4184's holding
speed before the crash ranged from 175 knots to 185 knots.
After flying in a holding pattern for about 36 more minutes, Flight
4184 was told by traffic controllers that it ``should be about 10
minutes, uh, till you're cleared in.''
The pilot thanked the controllers. By the time the controllers started
calling for the pilot to respond, the FAA calculated, the plane had
already crashed.
For the next 16 minutes, the controllers asked 17 times for Flight 4184
to respond. During that time, they also asked other planes about the
weather.
