Briton tries mid-air suicide, plane lands in Turkey 
A British man slashed his throat in a mid-flight suicide bid Sunday,
forcing a SriLankan Airlines plane to make an emergency landing in
Turkey, the Anatolia news agency said.
The flight was en route from Colombo to London when 49-year-old William
Bernard Gates was found in a pool of blood in one of the airplane's
lavatories, where he had apparently cut his throat with a piece of
broken mirror.
Gates, reported to suffer from chronic liver disease, was given
emergency treatment by a doctor on board, who stitched up his throat
with the help of the crew, Anatolia said.
The plane made an emergency landing in Istanbul, where Gates was
immediately taken to a local hospital.
Doctors quoted by Anatolia said the man was in good condition despite
losing a lot of blood and that his self-inflicted wound was not deep.
The plane later departed for London with the remaining passengers.
