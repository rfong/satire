Continued robberies threaten Afghanistan relief efforts
Lawlessness and ethnic rivalries are threatening relief efforts in
drought-striken areas of Afghanistan, a UN agency said Monday after the
second robbery of emergency food supplies in a week.
Gunmen beat up aid workers and stole 40 tonnes of food aid in Qaysawr
in northern Faryab province last Thursday, a week after 40 tonnes of
wheat was taken at gunpoint in Samangan province, World Food Programme
spokesman Khaled Mansour said.
"Though security is generally improving in Afghanistan, WFP is still
facing isolated incidents that threaten our efforts in various parts of
the country," he said.
Gunmen had been harassing aid workers in Qaysawr in recent weeks and on
Thursday "a group of armed Afghan Uzbeks looted the food warehouse
after severely beating the staff and smashing some vehicles."
In the days before the raid, WFP and non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), targeting families which would starve without humanitarian aid,
had distributed 700 tonnes of food in the predominantly ethnic Pashtun
area.
"The food aid is provided to people solely on the basis of need. There
are no ethnic strings attached," Mansour said, adding that the NGO
workers had to leave the area after the attack.
"We have requested the local authorities to investigate the incident,
have the food returned and protect all aid workers and aid operations."
The previous week, two trucks laden with wheat were held up by soldiers
in Aibak city in Samangan province, also in the north, and the drivers
beaten.
The wheat on one truck was distributed to people in a downtown street
and the other was taken to nearby military barracks.
Authorities in the area later told WFP the robbery was the result of "a
misunderstanding" by the soldiers, who were expecting their own food
convoy.
