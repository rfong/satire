Summer Camp for Obese Kids in Shanghai 
No fried chicken, no braised pork, no buttered bread. Life was really
hard for 13-year-old Yu Chi last week.
Yu weighs over 100 kilograms and, along with 52 other obese children
between 10 and 14 years old, was participating in a week-long summer
camp program for overweight kids in Shanghai, China's largest
commercial city.
On the first day of camp, two beds were broken when two of the kids sat
on them, said one camp counselor.
Children must get up at six o'clock every morning and then do exercises
such as running and swimming in the sweltering summer heat.
In addition to physical exercises, the camp highlights cultivating good
daily habits in the children, said the teacher, adding that they must
make their beds and wash their own clothes.
Doctors from local hospitals have been invited to present classes
teaching the children about the harm of obesity and how to
scientifically reduce their weight. The children's diet while at the
camp is planned by professional nutritionists.
China adopted the one-child policy some two decades ago. Since then,
Chinese parents have pampered their children with affection and allowed
them to over-indulgence in junk food.
Experts say that Chinese children now consume too much fat and sugar
while sitting in front of the TV all day long and almost never
exercising.
Recent statistics show that three out of every 100 Shanghai children
under the age of six suffer from obesity, 6.24 times the rate of a
decade ago.
