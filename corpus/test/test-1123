Manila Resolves Trade Dispute With Washington 
The Philippines has successfully resolved its pork and poultry trade
dispute with the United States after nearly 10 months of negotiations
between the two countries, a senior official said here Sunday.
Agriculture Secretary Salvador H. Escudero III told reporters that a
memorandum of understanding between the two governments was formally
signed in Washington Friday after 10 months of negotiations in Geneva
under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
"This settlement would not have been possible without the cooperation
of our hog and poultry industries," Escudero said.
Last April, Washington brought to the attention of the WTO its
complaints regarding the Philippines implementation of its pork and
poultry tariff quotas.
It claimed that the Philippines was not providing its trading partners
with full access to its quotas.
Under the Uruguay Round Final Act, all WTO members are obliged to
replace quantitative restrictions on agricultural products with
tariffs, and establish a tariff quota system that allows the entry of
imports at lower tariff rates.
Negotiations turned sour when Washington threatened to withdraw trade
concessions given to Philippine exports. Bilateral talks took a
positive turn last month after the U.S. government indicated that it
would not ask the WTO Dispute Settlement Body to look into the pork and
poultry issue.
"Instead of letting the U.S. complaints escalate into a formal dispute
in the WTO, both parties decided to work out an amicable settlement,"
Escudero said.
The Philippine Department of Agriculture recently modified its Minimum
Access Volume (MAV) rules to allow a faster transfer of under-used
quotas to bona fide importers.
