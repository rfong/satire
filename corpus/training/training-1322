Oil Firms Provides Aid for Xinjiang Poor 
Qiemo County, one of China's poorest and most remote counties in the
northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region had had a three million
US dollar windfall recently.
Esso China Upstream Ltd (ECU), and its two co-ventures, have donated
three million dollars on several social assistance projects in the
county.
The initial 1.6 million dollar contribution will fund the establishment
of highway maintenance stations along the Qiemo-Ruoquing highway,
improve access to clean water in rural areas, and provide sanitation
and hygiene education, enhance education planning and teaching training
and expand the Qiemo County Central Hospital.
Decision about the second-phase funding, amounting to 1.4 million
dollars, will be made at a later date, based on the results of the
first phase, according to W.W. Collier, president of the ECU.
At a donation ceremony held here on Tuesday, Yang Yongyi, executive
vice-chairman of the Foundation for Underdeveloped Regions in China
(FURC), said that the inhabitants in the county will benefit directly
from the projects.
Bodering in the Taklamakan desert to the north, Qiemo is the country's
second largest county in terms of its total area, with a population of
only 46,000, most whom work in agriculture and husbandry.
