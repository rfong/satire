Philippines Sees little Euro Launch Impact 
The Philippines' Central Bank and the Department of Finance believed
that the launch of the euro, the single European currency, next year
would have no immediate impact on the country, the newspaper Philippine
Star said Tuesday.
The newspaper quoted Gabriel Singson, governor of the Central Bank, as
saying that among the first likely effects of the currency union will
only be the need of the bank to convert some of its international
reserves into euros.
Some of the country's debts and trade payments would eventually be
settled in euros, he said. "But there is no immediate effect."
Officials of the Department of Finance agreed with the bank.
But sources of the department said the government should be ready to
deal with euro when it takes effect on January 1, 1999.
