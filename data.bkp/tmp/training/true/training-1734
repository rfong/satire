Pentagon/NNP Gulf/NNP War/NNP probe/NN blasted/VBD as/IN superficial/JJ ,/, lacking/VBG credibility/NN A/DT presidential/JJ panel/NN blasted/VBD Tuesday/NNP the/DT Pentagon/NNP 's/POS investigation/NN into/IN possible/JJ Gulf/NNP War/NNP exposures/NNS to/TO chemical/JJ and/CC biological/JJ weapons/NNS as/IN superficial/VBG and/CC lacking/VBG credibility/NN ./.

The/DT panel/NN called/VBD for/IN more/JJR research/NN but/CC said/VBD none/NN of/IN the/DT commonly/NN suspected/VBD Gulf/NNP War/NNP risk/NN factors/NNS appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB the/DT cause/NN of/IN the/DT unexplained/JJ illnesses/NNS reported/VBN by/IN thousands/NNS of/IN veterans/NNS ./.

President/NNP Bill/NNP Clinton/NNP ,/, receiving/VBG the/DT panel/NN 's/POS report/NN ,/, promised/VBD a/DT ``/`` comprehensive/JJ and/CC credible/JJ investigation/NN ''/'' and/CC asked/VBD the/DT Presidential/NNP Advisory/NNP Committee/NNP on/IN Gulf/NNP War/NNP Veterans/NNP Illnesses/NNPS to/TO oversee/VB the/DT Pentagon/NNP 's/POS investigation/NN ./.

The/DT Pentagon/NNP has/VBZ come/VBN under/IN mounting/VBG fire/NN since/IN its/PRP$ abrupt/JJ disclosure/NN in/IN June/NNP that/IN US/NNP troops/NNS may/MD have/VB been/VBN exposed/VBN to/TO a/DT nerve/NN agent/NN released/VBN when/WRB Iraqi/JJ chemical/NN weapons/NNS were/VBD inadvertently/RB destroyed/VBN in/IN March/NNP 1991/CD ./.

That/DT disclosure/NN ,/, more/JJR than/IN five/CD years/NNS after/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT war/NN ,/, followed/VBD years/NNS of/IN firm/NN denials/NNS by/IN Pentagon/NNP officials/NNS that/IN troops/NNS were/VBD exposed/VBN to/TO chemical/JJ or/CC biological/JJ weapons/NNS ./.

``/`` The/DT committee/NN is/VBZ pained/JJ by/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN of/IN government/NN mistrust/NN that/WDT now/RB surrounds/VBZ every/DT aspect/NN of/IN Gulf/NNP War/NNP veterans/NNS illnesses/NNS because/RB of/IN these/DT concerns/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ regrettable/JJ but/CC also/RB understandable/JJ ,/, ''/'' said/VBD committee/NN chairwoman/NN Joyce/NNP Lashof/NNP ./.

``/`` Our/PRP$ investigation/NN of/IN the/DT DOD/NN 's/VBZ -LRB-/-LRB- department/NN of/IN defense/NN 's/POS -RRB-/-RRB- efforts/NNS related/VBN to/TO chemical/NN and/CC biological/JJ weapons/NNS led/VBD us/PRP to/TO conclude/VB that/IN the/DT departments/NNS early/JJ efforts/NNS were/VBD superficial/JJ and/CC lacked/VBD credibility/NN ,/, ''/'' she/PRP said/VBD in/IN presenting/VBG the/DT committee/NN 's/POS report/NN on/IN its/PRP$ 16/CD month/NN inquiry/NN ./.

It/PRP said/VBD the/DT Pentagon/NNP 's/POS intransigeant/NN refusal/NN to/TO fund/NN research/NN into/IN low-level/JJ exposures/NNS to/TO chemical/NN weapons/NNS until/IN late/RB last/JJ year/NN had/VBD ``/`` done/VBN a/DT disservice/NN to/TO the/DT veterans/NNS and/CC to/TO the/DT public/NN ./. ''/''

Despite/IN its/PRP$ criticism/NN of/IN the/DT Pentagon/NNP 's/POS response/NN to/TO veterans/NNS '/POS concerns/NNS ,/, the/DT presidential/JJ committee/NN reached/VBD a/DT conclusion/NN similar/JJ to/TO that/DT of/IN the/DT Pentagon/NNP :/: combat/NN stress/NN was/VBD likely/JJ to/TO have/VB played/VBN an/DT important/JJ role/NN ./.

The/DT committee/NN looked/VBN at/IN nine/CD Gulf/NNP War/NNP risks/NNS suspected/VBN as/IN possible/JJ causes/NNS :/: chemical/NN weapons/NNS ,/, biological/JJ weapons/NNS ,/, pesticides/NNS ,/, vaccines/NNS ,/, the/DT drug/NN pyridostigmine/NN ,/, infectious/JJ diseases/NNS ,/, depleted/JJ uranium/NN ,/, oil/NN fires/NNS ,/, and/CC petrolum/NN products/NNS ./.

``/`` Based/VBN on/IN existing/VBG scientific/JJ data/NNS ,/, none/NN of/IN the/DT existing/JJ Gulf/NNP War/NNP risk/NN factors/NNS commonly/RB suspected/VBN appears/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT cause/NN ./.

And/CC while/IN the/DT committee/NN finds/VBZ that/IN stress/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB an/DT important/JJ contributing/VBG factor/NN to/TO Gulf/NNP War/NNP veterans/NNS illnesses/NNS ,/, the/DT story/NN is/VBZ by/IN no/DT means/NNS complete/JJ ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Lashof/NNP ./.

The/DT committee/NN called/VBN for/IN research/NN into/IN three/CD areas/NNS :/: the/DT effects/NNS of/IN low/JJ level/NN exposure/NN to/TO chemical/NN agents/NNS ;/: the/DT physical/JJ effects/NNS of/IN stress/NN on/IN the/DT body/NN ;/: and/CC into/IN synergies/NNS between/IN pyridostigmine/NN bromide/NN and/CC other/JJ Gulf/NNP War/NNP risk/NN factors/NNS ./.

Pyridostigmine/JJ bromide/NN pills/NNS were/VBD taken/VBN by/IN soldiers/NNS to/TO counter/VB the/DT effect/NN of/IN the/DT nerve/NN gas/NN soma/NN ,/, and/CC some/DT research/NN suggests/VBZ that/IN interaction/NN between/IN the/DT drug/NN and/CC other/JJ chemicals/NNS may/MD have/VB caused/VBN the/DT symptoms/NNS experienced/VBN by/IN vetrans/NNS ./.

Although/IN nearly/RB 90,000/CD veterans/NNS are/VBP on/IN government/NN registries/NNS of/IN victims/NNS of/IN Gulf/NNP War/NNP illnesses/NNS ,/, many/JJ veterans/NNS are/VBP ineligible/JJ for/IN disability/NN and/CC other/JJ benefits/NNS because/IN their/PRP$ ailments/NNS appeared/VBD more/JJR than/IN two/CD years/NNS after/IN the/DT war/NN ./.
