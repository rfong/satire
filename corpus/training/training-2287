S. African TV Cancels Election Debate 
South Africa's state television, under the South Africa Broadcasting
Corporation (SABC), has canceled a debate between leaders of the four
major political parties in the country after it failed to put them
together.
The planned debate, involving leaders of the African National Congress
(ANC), the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the New National Party (NNP)
and the Democratic Party (DP), was originally set to be broadcast two
days ahead of the June 2 election.
In a letter to the four parties Thursday, producer Maryanne de Villiers
said the program had been canceled because the SABC was unable to get
the leaders of the invited parties together.
ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe confirmed Thursday night that his party was
not prepared to allow its leader Thabo Mbeki to participate, but said
it was prepared to field other people in his place.
The IFP also said its president, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, was unable to
participate, because he had a hectic campaign schedule that day.
Meanwhile, the NNP said the cancellation of the special debate was a
clear indication that Mbeki was not prepared to enter into a debate
with its leader, Marthinus van Schalkwyk.
DP spokesman Douglas Gibson said his party's leader, Tony Leon, was
outraged as the debate had been canceled.
He called on the SABC to inform the public which leader had "chickened
out" of the planned debate.
The ANC's spokesman Masebe accused the opposition and the SABC of
wanting to use Mbeki to draw the crowds.
The election is believed to be a foregone conclusion with the ANC set
to win.
