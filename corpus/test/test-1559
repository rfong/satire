Kuwaiti crown prince returns to hospital 
Kuwait's crown prince and prime minister, Sheikh Saad al-Abdallah
al-Sabah, returned to hospital Friday for a follow-up to check-ups
earlier this week, the official KUNA news agency said.
It said the new tests were to ensure "the continued improvement in the
state of health" of 66-year-old Sheikh Saad. He entered hospital on
Tuesday and left two days later, but there has been no word on his
complaint.
The crown prince is a distant cousin of Emir Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah
who named him crown prince in 1978 under a power-sharing arrangement
between the Al-Jaber and Al-Salem branches of the ruling family.
The title carries with it the function of prime minister.
