WELFARE/RB For/IN many/JJ participants/NNS in/IN the/DT national/JJ debate/NN over/IN welfare/NN reform/NN ,/, welfare/NN is/VBZ spelled/VBN ``/`` AFDC/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT program/NN of/IN Aid/NNP for/IN Families/NNS With/IN Dependent/NNP Children/NNP ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT program/NN that/WDT gave/VBD rise/NN to/TO Ronald/NNP Reagan/NNP 's/POS florid/JJ description/NN of/IN a/DT ``/`` welfare/NN queen/NN ''/'' getting/VBG rich/JJ by/IN abusing/VBG the/DT system/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT program/NN that/IN some/DT blame/VBP for/IN the/DT disintegration/NN of/IN families/NNS because/IN it/PRP encourages/VBZ fathers/NNS with/IN low-paying/JJ jobs/NNS to/TO leave/VB home/NN so/IN their/PRP$ children/NNS can/MD qualify/VB for/IN AFDC/NN benefits/NNS ./.

AFDC/NNP is/VBZ blamed/VBN for/IN the/DT explosive/JJ growth/NN of/IN out-of-wedlock/JJ births/NNS because/IN it/PRP provides/VBZ an/DT economic/JJ support/NN system/NN for/IN single/JJ mothers/NNS ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ criticized/VBN for/IN encouraging/VBG long-term/JJ dependency/NNS on/IN government/NN payments/NNS and/CC for/IN doing/VBG little/JJ to/TO promote/VB self-sufficiency/NN ./.

``/`` Distrust/NN and/CC anger/NN with/IN the/DT current/JJ system/NN unite/VBZ the/DT entire/JJ country/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ David/NNP T./NNP Ellwood/NNP ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT Clinton/NNP administration/NN 's/POS top/JJ welfare/NN reform/NN architects/NNS ,/, discussing/VBG the/DT AFDC/NN program/NN ./.

AFDC/NNP is/VBZ the/DT ``/`` dole/NN ./. ''/''

It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT state-federal/JJ cash/NN welfare/NN program/NN for/IN children/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ mothers/NNS who/WP lack/VBP financial/JJ support/NN because/IN one/CD parent/NN is/VBZ absent/JJ from/IN the/DT home/NN or/CC is/VBZ incapacitated/JJ ,/, deceased/JJ or/CC unemployed/JJ ./.

AFDC/NNP is/VBZ an/DT entitlement/NN program/NN ,/, which/WDT guarantees/VBZ that/IN any/DT American/JJ meeting/NN the/DT eligibility/JJ requirements/NNS will/MD receive/VB benefits/NNS ,/, regardless/RB of/IN the/DT total/JJ cost/NN ./.

Approximately/RB 14.1/CD people/NNS received/VBD AFDC/NN cash/NN in/IN 1993/CD ,/, up/RB from/IN 7.4/CD million/CD beneficiaries/NNS in/IN 1970/CD ./.

AFDC/NN benefit/NN expenditures/NNS have/VBP also/RB skyrocketed/VBN ,/, from/IN $/$ 4.1/CD billion/CD in/IN 1970/CD to/TO $/$ 22.3/CD billion/CD in/IN 1993/CD ./.

In/IN 1970/CD ,/, the/DT federal/JJ government/NN spent/VBD $/$ 2.2/CD billion/CD and/CC the/DT states/NNS $/$ 1.9/CD billion/CD ./.

In/IN 1993/CD ,/, the/DT federal/JJ share/NN for/IN AFDC/NNP was/VBD $/$ 12.3/CD billion/CD ,/, while/IN the/DT states/NNS contributed/VBD the/DT rest/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, the/DT average/JJ AFDC/NNP monthly/JJ benefit/NN per/IN family/NN climbed/VBD from/IN $/$ 178/CD in/IN 1970/CD to/TO $/$ 373/CD in/IN 1993/CD ./.

According/VBG to/TO Bruce/NNP Reed/NNP ,/, the/DT White/NNP House/NNP deputy/NN policy/NN director/NN overseeing/VBG the/DT welfare/NN reform/NN effort/NN ,/, soaring/VBG numbers/NNS of/IN out-of-wedlock/JJ mothers/NNS account/VBP for/IN the/DT rapid/JJ growth/NN in/IN AFDC/NN caseloads/NNS ./.

``/`` Unwed/NNP teen/NN births/NNS are/VBP the/DT No./NN 1/CD engine/NN driving/VBG the/DT welfare/NN rolls/NNS ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Reed/NNP ,/, saying/VBG that/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN such/JJ births/NNS have/VBP doubled/VBN since/IN 1978/CD ./.

Two-thirds/NNS of/IN AFDC/NN recipients/NNS are/VBP children/NNS ,/, 53/CD percent/NN of/IN whom/WP were/VBD born/VBN out/RP of/IN wedlock/NN ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT General/NNP Accounting/NNP Office/NNP ,/, the/DT investigative/JJ arm/NN of/IN Congress/NNP ./.

About/RB half/PDT of/IN all/DT unwed/JJ teen/JJ mothers/NNS go/VBP on/IN welfare/NN within/IN one/CD year/NN of/IN the/DT birth/NN of/IN their/PRP$ child/NN ,/, 77/CD percent/NN go/VBP on/RP within/IN five/CD years/NNS ./.

Racially/RB ,/, 31/CD percent/NN of/IN AFDC/NN recipients/NNS are/VBP white/JJ ,/, 38/CD percent/NN black/JJ ,/, 17.4/CD percent/NN Hispanic/JJ ,/, and/CC 13.6/VBG percent/NN native/NN Americans/NNS ,/, Asians/NNPS and/CC others/NNS ./.

The/DT AFDC/NN program/NN is/VBZ administered/VBN by/IN the/DT states/NNS ./.

Each/DT state/NN defines/VBZ ``/`` need/NN ,/, ''/'' sets/VBZ benefit/NN levels/NNS and/CC administers/VBZ the/DT program/NN ./.

Eligibility/RB for/IN AFDC/NNP insures/VBZ eligibility/RB for/IN food/NN stamps/NNS and/CC Medicaid/NNP ,/, the/DT state-federal/JJ health/NN care/VBP program/NN for/IN the/DT poor/JJ ./.

The/DT states/NNS traditionally/RB have/VBP been/VBN at/IN liberty/NN to/TO pay/VB as/IN little/JJ or/CC as/RB much/JJ in/IN benefits/NNS as/IN they/PRP choose/VBP ./.

However/RB ,/, federal/JJ standards/NNS require/VBP that/IN children/NNS up/RB to/TO age/NN 18/CD are/VBP eligible/JJ ./.

AFDC/NN eligibility/NN and/CC benefits/NNS are/VBP determined/VBN monthly/RB ,/, with/IN each/DT state/NN establishing/VBG a/DT ``/`` need/NN standard/NN ./. ''/''

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT amount/NN of/IN income/NN the/DT state/NN decides/VBZ is/VBZ needed/VBN for/IN basic/JJ existence/NN ./.

Each/DT state/NN also/RB sets/VBZ a/DT ``/`` payment/NN standard/NN ,/, ''/'' usually/RB 100/CD percent/NN or/CC less/JJR of/IN the/DT ``/`` need/NN standard/NN ./. ''/''

Benefits/NNS are/VBP generally/RB computed/VBN by/IN subtracting/VBG the/DT individual/NN 's/POS income/NN from/IN the/DT state/NN 's/POS payment/NN standard/NN ./.

Maximum/JJ AFDC/NN payments/NNS vary/VBP sharply/RB from/IN state/NN to/TO state/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, state/NN payments/NNS for/IN AFDC/NN families/NNS of/IN three/CD in/IN January/NNP 1994/CD were/VBD :/: $/$ 120/CD in/IN Mississippi/NNP ,/, $/$ 164/CD in/IN Alabama/NNP ,/, $/$ 607/CD in/IN California/NNP ,/, $/$ 577/CD in/IN New/NNP York/NNP ,/, $/$ 184/CD in/IN Texas/NNP ,/, $/$ 546/CD in/IN Washington/NNP ,/, $/$ 459/CD in/IN Michigan/NNP ,/, and/CC $/$ 923/CD in/IN Alaska/NNP ./.

A/DT number/NN of/IN proposals/NNS were/VBD made/VBN last/JJ year/NN to/TO overhaul/VB AFDC/NN but/CC the/DT subject/NN was/VBD ignored/VBN by/IN Congress/NNP as/IN it/PRP focused/VBD on/IN health/NN care/NN reform/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT political/JJ climate/NN in/IN 1995/CD appears/VBZ ripe/JJ for/IN overhauling/VBG the/DT system/NN that/IN many/JJ liberals/NNS and/CC conservatives/NNS agree/VBP needs/VBZ a/DT big/JJ fix/NN ./.
