Olympic Champion Hwang to Go to Atlanta as Reserve 
Olympic gold medalist Hwang Young-Cho has failed to won a place in the
three-man team to the Atlanta Olympic Games but would still be there as
a reserve, sports officials said here on Wednesday.
The South Korean Amateur Athletic Federation said Hwang, who took the
men's marathon in Barcelona four years ago, was not selected because he
finished a miserable 29th place in an Olympic qualifier in Kyongju last
month.
Hwang, who blamed leg pains for his slow time in the race, was given
the reserve spot because of his glorious past, athletics officials
said.
Kim Yi-Yong, Lee Bong-woo and Kim Wan-ki finally earned their tickets
to the Atlanta Games.
