China Moves to Tackle Ceramics Oversupply 
China's sanitary ceramic ware industry is facing structural supply
difficulties.
The main problem is that production of low-class sanitary ceramics
exceeds demand while the industry's enterprises are unable to meet
demand for high-grade products, said a China Daily report today.
Industry experts told the newspaper that output of high-grade sanitary
ceramics only accounted for between ten and 15 percent of the total.
Output of sanitary ceramics totaled 54 to 55 million items in 1997, and
output this year is not expected to increase much.
But demand last year was only 30 million items, with the demand for
high-grade products accounting for 20 percent of this.
Experts predict that demand for sanitary ceramics will rise in the next
few years as the Chinese Government takes measures to stimulate the
real estate market.
But demand this year will not grow much since it will take some time
for the economy to see the effects of the government's action,
especially in sectors such as the building materials sector.
The industry authority has set a goal of increasing output of
high-grade sanitary ceramics to 25 percent of the total by 2000.
It is also expected to eliminate part of the production capacity of
low-class products.
The oversupply in the medium- and low-grade sanitary ceramics sector
has contributed to a price war, which has slashed profit margins.
Some sanitary ceramic manufacturers make inferior products to try to
balance income and expenditure, which has hampered the healthy progress
of the industry.
There are 400 enterprises producing sanitary ceramics across the
nation, one fourth of which are funded by overseas investment.
In the first quarter of this year, China exported 459,161 items of
sanitary ceramics worth 5.88 million US dollars, up 18.5 and 71. 6
percent from the same period of last year.
