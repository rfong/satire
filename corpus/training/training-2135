Japan hints at resuming aid to Burma 
A senior Japanese official hinted here Monday that Tokyo was
considering resuming official aid to Burma following the release in
Rangoon of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi this month.
"We are encouraged by the recent developments there," Japan's Deputy
Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda told journalists after Foreign Minister
Yohei Kono had met his Burmese counterpart Ohn Gyaw here.
Japan suspended aid after the Burmese junta refused to honor election
results in 1990.
Fukuda said "nothing concrete" had been discussed but "when we are
encouraged, of course it can affect our future behavior."
He said experts from both countries would have to discuss aid issues.
The two ministers met at the airport here, on the fringes of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) annual meeting.
The Burmese minister was leaving after attending the meeting to apply
for observer status for his country, which has been isolated by western
nations for human rights abuses but is being brought into the ASEAN
fold as part of the group's policy of "constructive engagement."
Asked if Aung San Suu Kyi, whose July 10 release was first disclosed to
the Japanese embassy in Rangoon, came up in the talks, Fukuda said, "We
didn't mention that name. It's their own decision."
"As you know we have had traditionally a very good relationship between
the two countries, and I think there are grounds for further better
relations between the two countries," Fukuda said.
Aung San Suu Kyi had been held under house arrest since 1989 after
leading pro-democracy protests that were suppressed violently by the
ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council.
Her National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in the 1990
elections, whose results were nullified by the junta, which has
convened a body to prepare for the drafting of a new constitution.
