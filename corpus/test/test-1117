Kohl Unveils Four-Year Program, Hopes His Government Lasts
Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised Monday to trim the bloated bureaucracy
and give more rights to foreigners during his new four-year term. But
critics said Kohl's ideas are hot air.
Kohl unveiled a 49-page legislative blueprint entitled ``Making United
Germany Fit For The Future.''
The document says the federal bureaucracy, which has about 90,000
workers, must be slimmed down so the government has more money to spend
on the reconstruction of former East Germany.
It calls for further welfare cuts for the same reason, and financial
incentives to encourage German companies to be more inventive.
Kohl told reporters: ``In the coming years we have to renew the economy
and society of the Federal Republic of Germany.''
Rudolf Scharping, who lost to Kohl in the Oct. 16 election and is head
of the opposition Social Democrats, said there is nothing new in the
document, which was written by the three parties in Kohl's coalition
government.
``There's not a single concrete answer to this country's main
challenges of the future,'' Scharping said.
Scharping said Kohl is avoiding real issues to keep his government,
weakened by the Oct. 16 election, from collapsing.
Kohl's majority fell from 134 to 10 parliamentary seats in the federal
election and he will probably have to steer a cautious course over the
next four years.
The legislative document proposes dual citizenship for some foreigners,
but the restrictions were immediately criticized as too harsh.
Germany's 1913 citizenship laws let foreigners have a German passport
if they can prove they have German blood. But it is far more difficult
for others to get citizenship.
Since neo-Nazi attacks against foreigners started four years ago, there
have been calls for granting dual citizenship to ease the integration
of non-Germans.
A plan announced by Kohl would created a ``children's nationality.''
This would let certain foreigners have dual citizenship until they
reach age 18, when they would have to give up citizenship in their home
country if they want to keep their German passports.
Young foreigners would only qualify for German citizenship if their
parents have lived in Germany for 10 years, and one of the parents was
born in Germany.
Faruk Sen, director of the Center for Turkish Studies in Essen, said
the proposal would do little for the integration of Germany's 6.9
million foreigners.
Of the 2 million Turks living in Germany, only about 9,000 would
qualify for citizenship under the coalition's proposal, Sen said.
Kohl's coalition faces its first post-election test on Tuesday when the
lower house of parliament, called the Bundestag, is to formally vote on
his appointment as chancellor.
Kohl refused to say whom he will name to his new Cabinet.
German media say Kohl worries that parliamentarians within his own
coalition could vote against him Tuesday if they are displeased with
his Cabinet choices.
