Argentina Fails to Respect Tradition: Maradona 
Soccer legend Diego Maradona said the Argentina team had been taught a
lesson for their failure to "respect traditional style of play."
"We didn't respect our origins nor our traditional style of play,"
Maradona blasted after Argentina lost to the Netherlands in the World
Cup quarterfinals.
"Argentina has tried to become a 'physical' European style team, but is
not able to choose between a physical game and technical skill," added
Maradona, who was in Marseille as a special commentator for a
television station.
"Today, we were disguised as Germans and the Netherlands as Argentines.
But you can say that the Netherlands taught us an important lesson
during this match."
He added: "From a physical point of view, yes, we are going home with
heads high. But that was not ture from a technical point of view.
Today, we played like, for example, a German team."
"You have to 'feel' football, and today, Argentina didn't 'feel' the
match," Maradona concluded.
He said Dennis Bergkamp, who scored the winner against Argentina, was
one of the players most impressed him.
"The players that have most impressed me are Michael Owen, Bergkamp,
and Rivaldo who've had an excellent World Cup," he said.
Maradona said he would like to end his soccer career as a coach for an
English club.
"I would like to coach a team. What would be really nice would be to
end my career as coach for an English club."
