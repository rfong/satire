U.S.-led Airstrikes Bombed Afghanistan for Third Straight Night 
For a third straight night, U. S.-led airstrikes rained bombs and
missiles on Kabul and other major Afghan cities through to Wednesday.
The attacks have targeted defensive positions and bases of the ruling
Taliban that protects Osama bin Laden, the primary suspect of September
11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington of the United States.
The U.S.-led coalition began airstrikes Sunday night and pressed ahead
with a promise to get Laden "dead or alive". But Afghanistan responded
to U.S. airstrikes with defiance and vowed revenge, pledging over two
million Afghan lives in a Jihad (holy struggle) against what it called
U.S. "open terrorism."
Mullah Zaeef, Taliban chief representative to Pakistan, told the press
here Tuesday that a cruise missile had slammed into a house of Mullah
Mohammad Omar, supreme leader of Taliban, but he was not there. He also
announced that at least 35 civilians were killed or wounded in the
airstrikes.
Another missile hit a demining office in Kabul, killing four guards and
seriously injuring others. The U.N.-funded demining office -- Afghan
Technical Consultants (ATC) is located in eastern Kabul's civilian
area.
