Cash Reward Offered For Reporting Illegal Activity 
East China's Fujian province issued Tuesday a regulation to offer large
amount of cash reward for people who report to local police the
production and trading of pornographic and pirated goods and other
illegal publications.
An official of the province's press and publication administration said
the enactment of the regulation aims to encourage the public to join in
the combat against all illegal publishing activities, in a bid to
ensure a sound and orderly development of local publication business.
The maximum cash reward offered to those reporting illegal replication
of CDs will reach 300,000 yuan, or some 3,6000 U.S. dollars.
