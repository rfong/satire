Yemen expels Algerians 
Yemeni authorities have ordered the expulsion of hundreds of Algerian
workers following the arrest last month of an Islamic militant
implicated in armed attacks, security services said Thursday.
"Algerian nationals are being expelled from the country without
exception following the arrest of the Algerian extremist Adem
Salaheddin," who will stand trial soon for crimes and sedition, they
said.
