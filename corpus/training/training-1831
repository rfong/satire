Argument between Christian and Moslem families leaves six dead 
A quarrel between a Christian and a Moslem family left six people dead
and 16 injured in northern Egypt, the interior ministry said on Monday.
The dispute began on Sunday in Demiana village, 158 kilometers (100
miles) north of Cairo, when a Moslem truck driver, Al-Shahat Ibrahim
Abdel Nabi, began arguing with a Christian doctor, Ata Sabet Assaidi,
over the price of transporting cattle.
Both men's families joined the argument, as did villagers, and it
degenerated into a free-for-all with gunshots fired. The victims were
from the two families, the ministry statement said.
