UK's Main Oppositions Agree on Reform Deal 
Britain's two main opposition parties, Labor and Liberal Democrats
published today a document setting out a program for wide-ranging
constitutional reform during the next parliament.
Under the present first-past-the-post system, votes are cast in single
member seats and victory goes to the candidate with the highest number
of votes.
At the 1992 general election the Liberal Democrats won just 20 seats in
the 651-member House of Commons despite polling more than one-sixth of
all votes cast.
The Conservatives have won overall majorities in four successive
general elections without polling more than 44 percent of the vote in
any of them.
Advocates of change in the opposition parties have been considering the
many options used in other countries - from national lists to
multimember constituencies and hybrids.
"There's been no trading of policy," said a participant. "It's all been
about finding the wildest possible areas of agreement."
The two opposition parties also agreed on the main reforms, which
include referendums on devolution for Scotland and Wales, and removal
of voting rights for hereditary peers in the House of Lords.
Under the agreed program, they will be replaced, in time, by life peer
on the basis of the national vote in the general election.
However, neither Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, nor Labor
Leader Tony Blair attend the launch of the agreement for fear of
turning it into an election issue.
