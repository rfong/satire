Vietnam's paper industry facing bankruptcy due to dumping: report 
Foreign dumping and rising costs are threatening Vietnam's paper
industry and its 35,000 workers as a rising number of mills are forced
to close, a report said Wednesday.
Countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have been
selling increasing amounts of paper at prices 60 percent below their
peak in 1989, creating a crisis in Vietnam's industry, the Vietnam News
Agency said.
Vietnamese paper is now priced at 200 dollars more than foreign
products despite a 20 percent import levy, the official news agency
said.
But Vietnamese firms imported 49,000 tonnes of paper last year, three
times the amount allowed by the government, the report said, adding
that illegal imports in Ho Chi Minh City were equivalent to a quarter
of domestic output.
Domestic production has been plagued by a doubling in the costs of raw
materials, inefficiency and over production.
Paper is one of the largest sectors in the state economy to have come
under intense pressure from foreign competition which is forcing the
government to restructure state industries.
But fearful of adding to the enormous ranks of Vietnam's unemployed,
the government has held off the closure of many paper mills, keeping
them running at as little as a quarter of capacity.
The official press has repeatedly called for urgent measures to save
the industry including higher import tariffs and reductions in the
price of water, power and raw materials.
