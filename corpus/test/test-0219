FBI ends investigation into Swedish group SKF's US factories
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has cut short an investigation
into operations at two factories in the !United States operated by Swedish
bearings company SKF, the Swedish financial daily Dagens Industri reported
on Thursday.
"We have received a very short message that the investigation against
us has been discontinued," SKF information director Lars Malmer told
the newspaper.
In July 1995, the two factories were raided by the FBI and
representatives of other federal agencies including the army, navy and
air force. Documents were seized, 900 employees were sent home and the
plants were temporarily forced to close.
The nature of the investigation has never been made public.
"We have never been provided with an explanation and know as little now
as we did then," Malmer said.
