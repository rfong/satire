Anhui Launches Seeds Project 
East China's Anhui province has launched a "seeds project" to raise the
coverage of fine seeds in the province to 98 percent by the end of this
century from the current 80 percent.
The project, including the breeding, production, processing, packaging
and marketing of seeds, will make seeds production a special industry.
In some parts of the province, farmers plant grains with their own
seeds or seeds bought randomly on markets.
The province needs more than 500 million kilograms of seeds every year.
Because of lax management in the past few years, farmers sometimes
suffered from a scarcity of seeds, or worst still were sold fake seeds.
Thanks to efforts made by the local government, 60 percent of the seed
strains of oil-bearing crops and cotton can now be provided for farmers
in an organised way in the province.
So far a 300-hectare original seeds base and 70,000 ha of seed
production bases have been built and the construction of processing and
marketing system is in full swing.
