Ericsson launches Chinese-language mobile phone 
Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson has launched a multilingual
mobile phone for Chinese language markets, giving the user the option
of displays in English, simplified Chinese or traditional Chinese,
Ericsson said on Tuesday.
The telephone, called the GH 398, is an adaptation of Ericsson's
successful GH 388 model. It was launched during Swedish Prime Minister
Goeran Persson's six-day visit to China aimed at boosting trade and
industry with the Asian country.
The phone, which measures only 23 millimetres thick and weighs 170
grammes, will be available for purchase throughout the Asia Pacific
region at the beginning of 1997.
It can be used on any GSM mobile telephone network.
