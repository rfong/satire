Moslems rally in critical support of government 
Two major Moslem groups have rallied in East Java pledging support for
President Suharto's New Order government but on the condition that it
fights corruption, reports said Monday.
"We'll support the New Order government as long as it proves its
intention to eliminate corruption and collusion," said Amien Rais,
chairman of the 28 million member Muhammadiyah.
Some 50,000 members of the modernising Moslem group on Sunday held a
rally at a sports stadium in Surabaya, East Java, the Jakarta Post
reported.
Rais said at the rally that if the government did not fight to
eradicate corruption then his organisation could only "pray that Allah
protect the New Order administration."
On Saturday about 20,000 members of the Ansor Moslem youth group also
held a rally in Kediri, East Java. The group, linked to the influential
Moslem grassroot organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), also urged a
critical approach to supporting the government.
"We want a critical view and a critical support for the government,"
said Choirul Anam, the chairman of the East Java branch of Ansor, the
youth wing of the 30 million strong NU.
Following the rally 10,000 Ansor members marched five kilometres (about
three miles) to an Islamic boarding school where Abdurrachman Wahid,
the NU's popular leader, met them.
Since violent riots hit Jakarta on July 27 a number of Moslem groups
have held rallies supporting the government and condemning what the
government says are communist groups which masterminded the riots.
According to the government, four died and 28 people were injured in
the riot. But a national commission on human rights has said five
people died, 74 were missing and 149 were injured.
Muhammadiyah's Rais said his group praised the government for improving
economic prosperity and political stability in the country.
In Indonesia 90 percent of the more than 195 million people are Moslem.
