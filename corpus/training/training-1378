Yugoslavia Condemns Sacking Bosnian Serb Republic President 
The Yugoslavian government strongly condemned Friday's decision by
peace envoy to Bosnia Carlos Westendorp to dismiss Bosnian Serb
republic President Nikola Poplasen.
In a statement carried by the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, the
Yugoslavia government described Westendorp's decision as an
illegitimate and "unprecedented tyrannic" action.
The decision is a most serious violation of the 1995 Dayton accord, the
Bosnian Constitution and the Bosnian Serb republic constitution and a
heavy blow to the Bosnian peace process, the statement said.
This move shows that the West's top peace envoy detracts and disregards
the sense of sovereignty of the voters in the Serb republic, it said.
Carlos Westendorp, who is said to have sweeping powers to implement the
Dayton accord, dismissed Poplasen, accusing him of endangering the
Bosnian peace process.
A Bosnian Serb television report quoted Poplasen as saying that he
would not accept the "illegitimate and undemocratic" decision.
Poplasen said he would only step down in the "same democratic way as he
was elected" and that there should be a referendum to decide on the
issue.
Westendorp went into action after Poplasen began proceedings this week
to sack Western-backed Prime Minister Dodik.
The envoy accused Poplasen of abusing his powers by refusing to
nominate a prime minister able to win a parliamentary majority.
The U.S.-brokered Dayton peace accord ended Bosnia's 43-month ethnic
war by establishing a Serb republic and a Moslem-Croat federation
within a single state.
