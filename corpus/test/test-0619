Most of the victims were elderly or ill people living in apartments lacking
air conditioning. Many victims had not even opened their windows for
security reasons.
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley instructed city officials to look into the
health of elderly people and move them to cooler quarters if they were
in danger. But most emergency shelters lacked air conditioning and were
practically empty during the weekend.
The northern part of the United States is ill equipped for heat waves,
unlike the southern, more tropical region.
"One difference between us and up North, air conditioners are almost
universal here," said Dr. Patrick Meeham, director of public health in
Georgia, one of the hottest and muggiest states.
"I suspect that people in the south are more used to dealing with hot
weather, so they know to drink cold liquids, they know to use fans,
they know to check on elderly loved ones," Meeham added.
In all areas affected by the heat wave authorities urge people to avoid
strenuous outdoor exercise and to drink plenty of liquids.
The heat wave that began last Wednesday was the most deadliest since
1980, when an estimated 1,500 people died of heat-related causes.
