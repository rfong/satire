Rome's Music City to rival Milan opera, cater for all tastes
After years of controversy, Italy's largest music complex is due to
open in Rome on Sunday, a huge project designed to cater for all tastes
and enable the capital to compete with the opera houses of Milan and
Verona.
The Music City, which replaces the auditorium destroyed by dictator
Benito Mussolini in 1934, contains three concert halls, the largest of
which has room for 2,756 spectators, a library, a museum and a
rehearsal hall.
The 140-million-euro (125-million dollar) complex was designed by
maverick Genoese architect Renzo Piano, who shocked the establishment
in the 1970s with the high-tech Georges Pompidou Centre which he and
British partner Richard Rogers designed for the 18th century heart of
Paris.
Piano's Music City resemble giant scarab beetles, the Ancient Egyptian
symbol of immortality, and covers 55,000 square metres (180,000 square
feet) of land near Rome's Olympic stadium.
Sunday's festivities, which will be attended by President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, promise non-stop music from 10:30 am (0930 GMT) to midnight,
from a morning performance of Rossini's opera "William Tell" to a late
night concert by rock star Patti Smith.
For the Santa Cecilia national academy, Rome's most prestigious choir
and orchestra, the new Music City is a godsend. The academy has lacked
a permanent home since Mussolini destroyed the city's auditorium nearly
70 years ago.
The ambitious project, hailed by Rome's left-wing mayor Walter Veltroni
as the symbol of a "new Renaissance ... that will vault Rome to the
forefront of international cultural events", nearly didn't get off the
ground.
Awarded to Piano in 1994, the project ran into trouble in 1995 when the
remains of a 6th century BC villa were discovered on the planned site.
Work was halted for over two years.
Bureaucratic hurdles and price hikes by wily contruction companies
added to the delays.
In fact, the Music City's biggest concert hall is still incomplete and
will not open to the public until December.
But the auditorium has the blessing of Italy's most renowned living
composer, 77-year-old Luciano Berio, even though music lovers will now
have to fork out 25.30 euros for concerts by the Santa Cecilia academy
-- over twice the price of a seat in the orchestra's temporary home
near the Vatican.
