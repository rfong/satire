Kenya To Reship Contaminated Milk To Holland 
Kenyan Government has decided to reship the contaminated milk to
Holland from where the milk had been imported.
The local "Daily Nation" newspaper quoted a source at the port of
Mombasa as confirming that the 100 tons of contaminated milk would be
loaded aboard the CMB EMERALD and transported back to Holland. the
Bahamas-registered vessel "will leave today or tomorrow after loading."
The contaminated milk dispute started about two months ago when an
Assistant Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and
Marketing, Dr Joseph Misoi, reported its presence in the country.
A major controversy ensued over the health status of the milk with the
importers, Agro Metro, at one point insisting that it was safe. However
it was later found to contain radioactive elements after tests by the
Government chemist.
