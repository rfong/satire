Russian/NNP Kursk/NNP Submarine/VBP to/TO Be/VB Raised/JJ in/IN September/NNP The/DT lifting/NN operation/NN of/IN the/DT wrecked/NNP Russian/NNP nuclear/JJ submarine/NN Kursk/NNP is/VBZ set/VBN for/IN September/NNP 15/CD and/CC will/MD last/VB from/IN eight/CD to/TO ten/CD hours/NNS ,/, Russian/NNP Deputy/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Ilya/NNP Klebanov/NNP told/VBD a/DT Friday/NNP press/NN conference/NN here/RB ./.

The/DT whole/JJ project/NN for/IN raising/VBG the/DT submarine/NN will/MD consist/VB of/IN two/CD stages/NNS ,/, said/VBD Klebanov/NNP ,/, who/WP heads/VBZ a/DT government/NN commission/NN investigating/VBG the/DT tragedy/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ or/CC preparatory/NN stage/NN will/MD start/VB in/IN July/NNP and/CC end/VB in/IN mid-September/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT second/NN is/VBZ scheduled/VBN to/TO start/VB on/IN September/NNP 10/CD ,/, which/WDT includes/VBZ ``/`` raising/VBG the/DT sub/NN ,/, fixing/VBG it/PRP to/TO a/DT barge/NN and/CC transporting/VBG it/PRP to/TO a/DT dry/JJ dock/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT vice/NN premier/NN said/VBD ./.

Russia/NNP unexpectedly/RB signed/VBD a/DT contract/NN on/IN raising/VBG the/DT sunken/JJ vessel/NN with/IN a/DT Dutch/JJ company/NN Mammoet/NN on/IN May/NNP 18/CD ,/, disbanding/VBG the/DT originally/RB expected/VBN Norwegian-U.S./JJ company/NN Halliburton/NNP at/IN the/DT very/RB last/JJ moment/NN ./.

Kursk/NNP ,/, a/DT state-of-the-art/JJ submarine/NN of/IN the/DT Russian/NNP Northern/NNP Fleet/NNP ,/, sank/VBD to/TO the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT Barents/NNP Sea/NNP last/JJ August/NNP during/IN a/DT naval/JJ exercises/NNS ,/, killing/VBG all/DT 118/CD crewmembers/NNS on/IN board/NN ./.

Presumed/JJ causes/NNS range/VBP from/IN misfiring/VBG of/IN torpedoes/NNS in/IN its/PRP$ front/JJ compartment/NN to/TO a/DT collision/NN with/IN a/DT foreign/JJ submarine/NN spying/VBG in/IN the/DT exercise/NN area/NN ./.

Klebanov/NNP said/VBD the/DT cause/NN of/IN the/DT catastrophe/NN could/MD be/VB determined/VBN only/RB after/IN the/DT Kursk/NNP was/VBD raised/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, he/PRP stressed/VBD it/PRP ``/`` was/VBD already/RB clear/JJ to/TO the/DT committee/NN ,/, ''/'' that/IN a/DT torpedo/NN ,/, detonated/VBN in/IN the/DT first/JJ compartment/NN of/IN the/DT submarine/NN ,/, was/VBD a/DT factor/NN in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT catastrophe/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP is/VBZ unclear/JJ what/WP trigged/VBD the/DT explosion/NN ,/, a/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT torpedo/NN itself/PRP or/CC a/DT collision/NN of/IN the/DT sub/NN with/IN an/DT external/JJ object/NN ,/, ''/'' Klebanov/NNP said/VBD ./.

Russia/NNP 's/POS plan/NN is/VBZ to/TO raise/VB the/DT 20,000-ton/JJ submarine/NN with/IN massive/JJ cables/NNS after/IN the/DT forward/JJ section/NN is/VBZ cut/VBN away/RP to/TO avoid/VB detonation/NN of/IN its/PRP$ torpedoes/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, Russian/NNP Navy/NNP Commander/NNP Admiral/NNP Vladimir/NNP Kuroyedov/NNP told/VBD reporters/NNS that/IN the/DT decision/NN on/IN how/WRB to/TO handle/VB the/DT submarine/NN 's/POS fore/NN section/NN would/MD be/VB made/VBN after/IN evaluation/NN of/IN the/DT condition/NN of/IN torpedoes/NNS in/IN it/PRP ./.

``/`` We/PRP are/VBP very/RB worried/JJ by/IN what/WP we/PRP could/MD find/VB in/IN the/DT first/JJ compartment/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, adding/VBG that/IN unexploded/JJ torpedoes/NNS could/MD remain/VB there/RB ./.

The/DT compartment/NN will/MD be/VB sectioned/VBN off/RP from/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT Kursk/NNP in/IN an/DT inclined/VBN line/NN ./.

``/`` This/DT is/VBZ related/VBN to/TO a/DT certain/JJ technology/NN and/CC safety/NN ,/, ''/'' Kuroyedov/NNP said/VBD ./.
