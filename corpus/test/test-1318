Fighting resumes on Bosnia's southwest front 
Civilians have come under artillery fire from Bosnian Serb forces in
the southwest Livno area, Bosnian Croat military sources said
Wednesday, amid fears of an escalation in fighting on that front after
a week's calm.
Meanwhile in the northwest Moslem enclave of Bihac, a girl aged four
was killed in an artillery bombardment by the Bosnian Serbs, UN sources
said in Zagreb.
The town of Livno was under general alert for the second consecutive
day Wednesday after several heavy calibre rounds hit the outskirts
Tuesday, the Croat newsagency Hina said, citing the commander of the
Bosnian Croat forces (HVO).
Fighting between Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat troops erupted Tuesday
in the hills overlooking the nearby town of Glamoc in Bosnia, which is
under Serb control.
The Croat forces have been cutting through Serb lines in the sector,
the same source said.
The HVO has led an offensive in the Livno area since the end of
November, pushing back Serb forces behind the lines sketched out by the
five-nation contact group under their plan to split Bosnia between the
Serbs and the Croat-Moslem Federation.
Sources said the Bosnian Croats could now threaten the Croatian Serbs'
"capital" Knin with their artillery, as well as their positions across
the border in Glamoc.
Military experts in Zagreb have warned of a counter-offensive by
Bosnian Serb forces in support of their Croatian brethren.
