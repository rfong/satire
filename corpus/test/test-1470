official development assistance (ODA) worth 88 billion yen in the 1998
fiscal year to develop Vietnam's infrastructure facilities.

bilateral trade agreement at an early date.

Tuesday. He will visit Australia from Wednesday to Saturday.
Japan is the largest donor to Vietnam, the third largest foreign
investor and also one of the important trade partners of Vietnam.
