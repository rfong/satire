Dynamic/NNP duo/NN defy/VBP Kiwis/NNP England/NNP all/DT but/CC ensured/VBD victory/NN in/IN the/DT three-match/JJ series/NN on/IN Friday/NNP ,/, thanks/NNS to/TO dynamic/JJ duo/NN Darren/NNP Gough/NNP and/CC Philip/NNP DeFreitas/NNP ./.

Test/NNP debutant/NNP Gough/NNP and/CC born-again/JJ all-rounder/JJ DeFreitas/NNS combined/VBN to/TO shatter/VB New/NNP Zealand/NNP 's/POS dreams/NNS with/IN first/JJ bat/NN and/CC then/RB ball/NN on/IN the/DT second/JJ day/NN of/IN the/DT third/JJ Test/NN at/IN Old/NNP Trafford/NNP ./.

After/IN rescuing/VBG England/NNP from/IN a/DT second/JJ batting/NN slump/NN ,/, helping/VBG to/TO steer/VB them/PRP to/TO a/DT respectable/JJ 382/NN all/DT out/IN at/IN tea/NN ,/, the/DT pair/NN took/VBD two/CD wickets/NNS each/DT to/TO leave/VB the/DT Kiwis/NNPS rocking/VBG at/IN 84-4/CD at/IN the/DT close/NN ./.

With/IN the/DT hosts/NNS already/RB 1-0/VBG up/RP after/IN the/DT first/JJ two/CD Tests/NNS ,/, only/RB a/DT spectacular/JJ turn-around/NN can/MD prevent/VB Mike/NNP Atherton/NNP from/IN securing/VBG his/PRP$ first/JJ series/NN victory/NN as/IN captain/NN ./.

Atherton/NN ,/, newly/RB reappointed/VBN to/TO lead/VB his/PRP$ country/NN in/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ series/NN against/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP ,/, had/VBD played/VBN a/DT major/JJ part/NN in/IN establishing/VBG a/DT position/NN of/IN strength/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN he/PRP failed/VBD to/TO convert/VB his/PRP$ first/JJ day/NN 96/CD into/IN a/DT really/RB substantial/JJ century/NN ./.

But/CC his/PRP$ early/JJ morning/NN departure/NN for/IN 111/CD merely/RB cleared/VBD the/DT stage/NN for/IN DeFreitas/NNP and/CC Gough/NNP ./.

Craig/NNP White/NNP had/VBD gone/VBN without/IN adding/VBG to/TO his/PRP$ overnight/JJ 42/NN ,/, snicking/VBG Michael/NNP Owens/NNP low/JJ to/TO third/JJ slip/NN ./.

Then/RB the/DT captain/NN ,/, having/VBG toiled/VBN for/IN six/CD and/CC a/DT half/NN hours/NNS ,/, lost/VBD a/DT debatable/JJ lbw/NN decision/NN to/TO Dion/NNP Nash/NNP ./.

And/CC when/WRB Nash/NNP removed/VBD Steve/NNP Rhodes/NNP via/IN a/DT gloved/JJ catch/NN to/TO the/DT keeper/NN ,/, England/NNP were/VBD a/DT precarious/JJ 235/CD for/IN seven/CD ./.

But/CC then/RB Gough/NNP and/CC DeFreitas/NNP produced/VBD two/CD wonderfully/RB entertaining/VBG half-centuries/NNS ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ eighth-wicket/JJ stand/NN of/IN 130/CD knocked/VBD the/DT stuffing/VBG out/RP of/IN the/DT Kiwis/NNPS ./.

DeFreitas/NNS '/POS 69/NN included/VBD eight/CD fours/NNS before/IN he/PRP played/VBD on/RP against/IN Owens/NNP ,/, while/IN Gough/NNP found/VBD the/DT boundary/NN ten/CD times/NNS with/IN his/PRP$ 65/CD ,/, only/RB to/TO eventually/RB drive/VB Chris/NNP Pringle/NNP to/TO substitute/VB Heath/NNP Davis/NNP at/IN extra/JJ cover/NN ./.

Although/IN Angus/NNP Fraser/NNP could/MD not/RB prolong/VB the/DT splendidly/RB spirited/VBN resistence/NN for/IN long/RB ,/, England/NNP 's/POS total/NN was/VBD comfortingly/RB high/JJ after/IN Thursday/NNP 's/POS low/NN of/IN 104/CD for/IN four/CD ./.

It/PRP looked/VBD positively/RB mountainous/JJ by/IN the/DT time/NN Gough/NNP and/CC DeFreitas/NNP had/VBD spectacularly/RB joined/VBN forces/NNS again/RB ./.

Gough/NNP 's/POS fifth/JJ ball/NN in/IN Test/NNP cricket/NNP reared/VBN up/RP toward/IN 's/VBZ Mark/NNP Greatbatch/NNP 's/POS body/NN ./.

He/PRP succeeded/VBD in/IN getting/VBG his/PRP$ injured/JJ left/JJ thumb/NN ,/, fractured/JJ while/NN fielding/NN ,/, out/RB of/IN the/DT way/NN but/CC gloved/VBD right-handed/JJ to/TO Hick/NNP at/IN second/JJ slip/NN ./.

DeFreitas/NNS ,/, coming/VBG on/RP as/IN first/JJ change/NN ,/, struck/VBD even/RB sooner/RBR with/IN Ken/NNP Rutherford/NNP driving/VBG the/DT paceman/NN 's/POS opening/NN delivery/NN to/TO mid-off/NN ,/, where/WRB Graham/NNP Gooch/NNP held/VBD his/PRP$ 100th/JJ Test/NNP catch/NN at/IN the/DT third/JJ attempt/NN ./.

Gough/NNP returned/VBD to/TO have/VB Stephen/NNP Fleming/NNP taken/VBN low/RB down/RB behind/IN the/DT stumps/NNS and/CC then/RB DeFreitas/NNP made/VBD sure/JJ honors/NNS finished/VBD even/RB when/WRB Bryan/NNP Young/NNP snicked/VBD an/DT attempted/JJ square/JJ drive/NN into/IN Rhodes/NNP '/POS waiting/VBG gloves/NNS ./.

Only/RB Martin/NNP Crowe/NNP ,/, suffering/VBG badly/RB from/IN flu/NN ,/, was/VBD left/VBN standing/VBG between/IN England/NNP and/CC a/DT decisive/JJ first/JJ innings/NNS lead/NN ./.
