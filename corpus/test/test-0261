The White House said Monday the US budget deficit for the current
fiscal year would be 154.4 billion dollars, but said the budget would
be in surplus by 2002 under its spending plan.
In its economic forecast as part of its fiscal 1997 budget proposal,
the White House said economic growth unadjusted for inflation would be
5.1 percent in 1996 and that inflation would be 2.9 percent.
