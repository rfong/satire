Ukrainian Ex-Prime Minister Arrested in Switzerland 
Ukrainian ex-prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko has been arrested in
Switzerland for alleged money- laundering during his term of office,
Ukrainian embassy in Switzerland confirmed Friday.
Investigation against him opened in Switzerland as early as in March,
and his bank accounts in Geneva have been frozen, said the Interfax
news agency.
Lazarenko, an opposition deputy in parliament, appeared before a Swiss
judge for four hours, following his arrest in Basle on Wednesday. He
was also charged with carrying a Panamanian passport.
Two envoys of Lazarenko's opposition center-left Hromada party were
reportedly sent to seek to "clarification" of the matter and make sure
that the enquiries were conducted impartially.
If Lazarenko's Panamanian passport bears his name, he will be indicted
as violating Ukrainian law, which does not permit its nationals to have
double nationality.
Lazarenko was prime minister from May 1996 to July 1997.
