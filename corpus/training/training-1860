Arafat to visit Nablus and Jordan 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will visit Nablus, the focus of
Israel's heavy security seal on West Bank towns, on Saturday ahead of a
visit to Jordan to meet King Hussein, officials said.
Arafat will attend a meeting of his cabinet and the PLO's executive
committee in Nablus, Palestinian industry minister Suleiman al-Najjab
told Palestinian radio on Friday.
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai announced the day before
that Nablus would be the only West Bank town to remain under an army
seal due to be lifted from other self-rule areas on Sunday.
Entry and exit to West Bank towns was imposed after Israeli-Palestinian
clashes erupted across the territories late last month, leaving over 80
dead.
Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish site held by Israeli forces inside the Nablus
self-rule area, was the focus of heavy fighting during the turmoil.
Since then, Nablus has been surrounded by tanks and reinforced
roadblocks.
Arafat's top adviser Nabil Abu Rudeina told the radio Arafat would head
to Jordan "early next week" to discuss with King Hussein the results of
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations ongoing since Sunday.
