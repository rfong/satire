Mongolians Dominate Judo International 
Mongolian judokas made a clean sweep of all the medals but four bronzes
at the seventh Erdenet Judo International Tournament which ended here
on Sunday.
Some 100 competitors from Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan and host Mongolia
took part in the three-day tournament.
The annual event, which was inaugurated in 1990, has moved here from
northern Mongolia's industrial city of Erdenet since last year.
