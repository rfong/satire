Storm brewing over Indonesian minister's alleged mining fraud 
A storm is brewing here over allegations that Mine and Energy Minister
Ida Bagus Sujana channelled 40 billion rupiah (16.9 million dollars)
into his bank account from a state-owned coal company, a report said
Thursday.
In its latest issue, the weekly Gatra magazine alleged that Sujana sent
a letter in early 1994 to the directors of PT Tambang Batubara Bukit
Asam demanding 50 billion rupiah be transfered to his account for a
fund "to advance the prosperity of ministry employees."
The board of directors resisted the request, but after receiving a
public warning from Sujana, transferred a sum of 40 billion rupiah into
Sujana's personal account.
"I and the other members of the management first ignored the letter
because it was against the regulations. But we later decided to make
the transfer but only to the sum of 40 million rupiah," said Ambyo
Mangunwijaya, then president of PT Tambang, was quoted saying.
The directors also reported the money transfer to PT Tambang's board of
commisioners, the Government Finance Controller and the Supreme Audit
Agency.
Ambyo and the other directors of PT Tambang were sacked in August 1994.
The ministry's Director General of Mines Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, who at
the time also protested the funds transfer, had his powers to approve
mining licences stripped last month by Sujana.
The minister transferred those powers to himself.
Sujana has denied any wrongdoing and slammed the reports as "complete
slander," Gatra reported.
The secretary general of the ministry, Umar Said, has also denied the
allegations of corruption saying that "the reports on the personal
account were too much," the Jakarta Post said.
Ministry officials were unavailable for comment on Thursday.
