Debate on Zambian President's Term Continues 
The debate continues over if Zambian President Frederick Chiluba should
run for a third term in 2001 presidential elections.
Some activists of the ruling Movement for Multi-Democracy (MMD) in the
north of the country Monday urged Chiluba to ignore demand he run for
the third term, according to Times of Zambia Tuesday.
The newspaper quoted former Nkana constituency youth chairman Leonard
Mwanang'ombe as saying in Kitwe that Chiluba should set a precedent of
respecting the constitution for democracy to thrive.
He said that it will be retrogressive to follow the demand as the
opposition will take advantage of it and criticize the ruling party.
"Let us not be like UNIP ( the opposition United National Independence
Party led by former President Kenneth Kaunda) which changed the
constitution to suit individuals, President Chiluba has already done a
lot for the country and MMD," said Mwanang'ombe.
There are lot of capable leaders in MMD who would take over from
Chiluba and these will obviously pursue MMD policies, he said.
Meanwhile, opposition United Party for National Development (UPND)
warned MMD of the consequences of amending the constitution to suit one
individual's interest, The Post newspaper reported Tuesday.
Chiluba repeatedly stated that he would not run for a third term.
Recently some MMD officials, especially youth wing, urged Chiluba to
run for a third term and called for a constitutional amendment to allow
him to do so.
The constitutional amendments adopted in 1996 do not allow those with
foreign parentage and those who have already served two five-year terms
of the presidency to stand for elections any more.
In the 1996 elections Kaunda was barred from contesting because he was
born of Malawian parents and ruled the country for 27 years since
Zambia's independence in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by
Chiluba.
