Montgomerie takes initiative in battle of Scots
Colin Montgomerie seized the initiative in his battle with fellow Scot
Sam Torrance for leading money winner on the European Tour with a round
of 65 here on Saturday to lead the Lancome trophy by three strokes as
Torrance could only shoot a 69.
The two Scots both selected for the Ryder Cup clash with the United
States on September 23rd and 24th have shared the lead since the first
round with the lead alternating every day. Montgomerie presently heads
the money list with Torrance second overall.
Montgomerie, beaten in the PGA play-off by Australian Steve Elkington,
though was not counting on victory even with the three shot gap:
"Anything can happen on Sunday. It is between Sam and me I suppose. I
was 10 ahead of Jamie Spence once and did not win. You are never sure
in this game.
I feel I am playing as well as I have ever done. I don't back away from
a challenge, and it will be a great challenge on Sunday."
Sam Torrance winner of the Irish Open this year suggested that he would
mount a death or glory challenge: "I have nothing to lose now, three
behind going into the last round. At one stage I was four behind, and
it could have been worse. He is in relentless form the large Scot
(Montgomerie)."
New Zealander Michael Campbell fell away with a disappointing four over
par 74 after lying third overnight but Australian Wayne Riley enjoying
a great season including victory in the Scottish Open shot a 68 to go
third. The two Scots will be well aware of Riley's ability to shoot low
rounds when he's on form.
