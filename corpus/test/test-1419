Britain Condemns Artillery Attack on Sarajevo 
Britain condemned today's artillery attack on a market place in
Sarajevo in which at least 33 people were killed and 88 wounded.
Baroness Lynda Chalker, Britain's Minister of Overseas Development
Administration, called the attack "senseless and depraved" and said
Britain was ready to respond to any request for humanitarian help.
"There can never be any justification for these attacks on civilians
and we condemn those responsible," Chalker said in a statement.
"There can be no military solution to this conflict. This further
attack on Sarajevo is a tragic illustration of the urgent need for a
political solution," she added.
Chalker said Britain strongly supported U.S. peace efforts to put an
end to the war in Bosnia.
The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, who will meet
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic today in Paris and will go to
Belgrade tomorrow to see Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, said the
next week or two were potentially critical to the peace process.
