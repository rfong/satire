Italy's foreign minister wins Israeli praises 
Israel voiced satisfaction Monday after Italy's Foreign Minister
Susanna Agnelli decided not to visit the PLO headquarters in annexed
east Jerusalem during an official visit this week.
Agnelli, who arrives Tuesday, will meet PLO chairman Yasser Arafat in
Gaza City before talks with Israeli leaders in Jerusalem on Wednesday.
The Palestinians, who want east Jerusalem for the capital of a future
state, set considerable symbolic store by high level meetings at the
headquarters called Orient House.
The European Union urges member country's foreign ministers to visit
Orient House, which officially houses the Palestinian delegation to the
Middle East peace talks.
But Agnelli has missed it off her schedule.
"It's the right thing to do," Israel's ambassador to Rome told
reporters. "I think that those personalities who went there made a
mistake, which harmed their visit to Israel.
France's Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Ireland's Foreign Minister
Dick Spring both braved Israeli anger and visited Orient House this
year.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman cancelled a meeting with Spring in
protest.
Israel considers east Jerusalem a part of its united capital and
insists that foreign visitors meet Palestinian leaders in the
autonomous areas of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.
"Italy has very friendly attitude to us," Pazner said.
