At least 320 people died in the blaze in Dronka village and another 35
in the floods which swept across Asyut province in southern Egypt,
officials said Thursday.
The governor's office revised an earlier toll of 240 for the number of
villagers killed on Wednesday when Dronka was engulfed by the fire from
an oil depot, triggered by torrential rains.
Thirty-five died in flooding in other parts of the province.
