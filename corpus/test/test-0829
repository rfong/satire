World Bank in 40 million USD loan to Chad 
The World Bank announced Tuesday it has granted a 40 million dollar
loan to Chad targeting the African nation's poverty reduction program.
The loan, which matures in 40 years and has a 10-year grace period, was
approved by the International Development Association, part of the
World Bank Group.
The poverty reduction program seeks to put in place the infrastructure
needed to combat poverty, as initial revenues from the start-up of the
oil sector become available in 2003.
A consortium made up of Esso, Chevron and Petronas oil companies has
launched major projects in Chad ahead of exploitation of the Doba basin
in the south of the country.
A crude oil transportation pipeline will be run from Doba to
neighboring Cameroon's Kribi terminal 1,050 kilometers (650 miles)
away.
The loan will also be used in the nation's project to develop the
cotton industry.
