Argentine peso sinks to historic law 
The Argentine peso on Monday plunged to a record low, dropping 23
percent against the US dollar in spite of government efforts to shore
up the embattled currency.
The currency was traded at 4.00 pesos to the dollar, sliding down from
last week's low of 3.08 pesos to the US dollar Friday.
