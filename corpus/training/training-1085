The commander said the the ecological organisation's militants had shown
"very strong determination" in opposing the tests.
He said that "posturing for the media was one thing" but putting divers
under water was not aimed at attracting press attention. He said any
militants who entered the lagoon would be arrested.
The Vice Admiral also said that preparations for the first nuclear test
were "progressing normally" on Mururoa.
He said he was not "obsessed" by the line demarcating the atoll's
12-nautical-mile territorial exclusion zone. "If a boat happens to be
very close to the atoll when the test is under way, that is not a
problem," he said, noting that fully-manned naval vessels would be in
the lagoon during the blast.
But he said that if the Greenpeace helicopter flew across the site, "we
would wait for it to go away, there would be no problem."
The French navy has 15 vessels protecting the lagoon.
Meanwhile in Papeete about 30 anti-nuclear protesters Thursday breached
the perimeter of a French airforce base and staged a two-hour
demonstration, witnesses said.
The mostly female demonstrators -- members of Tahiti's pro-independence
Te Toto Tupuna party -- broke into the base in Fa'aa, adjacent to the
French Polynesian island's international airport.
They unfurled banners and shouted slogans for two hours, before leaving
peacefully.
