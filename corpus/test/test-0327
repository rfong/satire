Kobe's mourning forces Murayama to "humbly" accept criticism by Makiko Tazaki 
The people of Kobe on Friday tearfully mourned victims of its
devastating earthquake one month ago, while the growing national
fallout forced Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama to "humbly" accept
criticism of his government's handling of the disaster.
The few offices and workplaces able to get back to work came to a
standstill for a minute at noon to remember the 5,378 dead and ponder
the destruction left by the 7.2 Richter scale quake that struck just
before dawn on January 17.
The prime minister vowed to step up efforts to rebuild Kobe, he told
reporters in Tokyo in comments to mark the one-month anniversary.
Speaking of attacks over his government's performance, he said "there
are various opinions and criticism," adding he would "humbly accept
them."
"I want to do my utmost to make the administration and parliament unite
to live up to the expectations of the people who suffered from the
quake," he told reporters after his cabinet endorsed its first
emergency measures on quake rehabilitation and sent the bills to
parliament.
In front of the Hyogo prefecture office, which controls Kobe and
neighbouring quake-hit districts, governor Toshitami Kaihara led
prayers with some 500 employees who closed their eyes and bowed their
heads.
Speaking at a news conference afterwards, Kaihara said he was "filled
with remorse for what has been lost." He pledged new efforts to help
ease suffering and rebuild the region.
The governor said the emphasis must be placed on housing all the
refugees. He said the regional government hoped to provide better
accomodation for all homeless by the end of March.
Some 300,000 people were left homeless and more than 100,000 homes and
buildings destroyed. A month later around 200,000 people are still
living in often freezing shelters, mostly schools.
"The government must do something about houses as soon as possible,"
said Harue Kimura, a 60-year-old resident of the Nagata district.
"People may start fighting with each other as stress was growing. There
could be a murder."
"We are surviving thanks to young volunteers. What has the government
done for us ? Nothing," she said.
Other citizens are complaining about what they see as the authorities
focus on rebuilding infrastructure rather than helping people.
"The government is putting the priority on things like traffic.
Restoring our lives is definitely being delayed. We haven't been able
to have normal life for such a long time," said the owner of a
restaurant in central Kobe.
His restaurant re-opened 12 days after the quake, but with no tap water
and gas available, has only a limited menu.
Other problems have also surfaced in the month since Kobe hit world
headlines.
Toshiko Komeda, a counsellor for the telephone helpline run by the city
government, said the number of calls from people who had lost relatives
and friends had started to increase.
"Victims had to take care of practical matters at first, and that in a
way distracted them from feeling distress."
Job shortages are also mounting. With the quake shock now receding
people are now realising they need work to pay the bills, officials
said.
Throughout the region, the cleanup operation is being carried on, often
through the night. It is expected to take months to remove the
destroyed buidings and years to restore the once elegant port city.
Governor Kaihara said he expected reconstruction to take about three
years.
