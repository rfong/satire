Sampras, Chang advance to Salem Open final
World number two Pete Sampras and fellow
Sampras, who on Saturday defeated Dutchman Jan Siemerink 6-3, 4-6, 7-6
(7-2) in his semi-final, is hoping to unseat current world number one
Austrian Thomas Muster by winning the title.
Second-seeded Chang, who beat Australian Todd Woodbridge 6-3, 6-4, is
aiming for his third consecutive title in the city he treats as a home
away from home.
Sampras has a good chance of reclaiming the number one ranking,
depending on how Muster performs in Estoril.
While the three-time Wimbledon champion has no points to defend this
week, Muster will lose 359 points and is only 72 ahead of Sampras in
the latest rankings list.
But Sampras' mind will be on winning rather than the rankings.
"I won't be thinking about it much," he said. "If I get it in Hong
Kong, great, otherwise I will go on to Tokyo and try and get it there.
"I think, in terms of rankings, what happens at the end of the year
shows who is the best player."
Chang will certainly have the crowd on his side, as Australian
Woodbridge grugingly testified.
Woodbridge, the sixth seed and ranked 27th in the world, bemoaned the
partisan support for Chang, which he felt went over the top on many
occasions.
"It's horrendous playing him in Hong Kong," said Woodbridge.
"How many times do you make an error and they cheer?
"I enjoy playing in Hong Kong, but not against Chang. It happens in
Davis Cup, but you don't expect it to happen in tournaments.
"It's not really great when you make an error because they are happier
than when you make a really great shot."
Chang said he was grateful to play in front of good support.
"The crowd here I think is relatively fair," said world number four
Chang.
"The majority of them are behind me and I'm sure if I was in Australia
the majority of the crowd would be behind him."
