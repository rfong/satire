Kuwait to Provide Bangladesh 40 Mln Dollars for Power Project 
Kuwait is expected to extend a loan of 40 million U.S. dollars to
finance the foreign exchange component cost of a project which is aimed
at improving the power transmission and distribution system in
Chittagong, the second largest city of Bangladesh, a press release of
the Kuwait Embassy said here Monday.
A delegation of Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development ( KFAED)
concluded a draft agreement here Monday on Greater Dhaka Chittagong
Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Phase III), the press
release said.
The project cost is estimated at about 142 million U.S. dollars, of
which 70 million dollars would be in foreign currency. The KFAED would
provide a loan of 40 million dollars, more than half of the foreign
exchange component, to finance the project.
The project, which aims to meet the growing demand for electricity in
the Chittagong metropolitan city and its adjacent industrial areas up
to the year 2005, consists of the extension, renovation and
rehabilitation of transmission and distribution networks to serve about
160,000 new consumers.
Construction, expansion and renovation of 2,750-kilometer-long high,
medium and low voltage lines and construction of 42 high and medium
voltage sub-stations are parts of the important features included in
the project.
The loan will be the 15th in a series of loans extended by the KFAED to
finance projects in various sectors in the country, especially in power
and transport sectors.
