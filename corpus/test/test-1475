In Geneva, meanwhile, talks to end the conflict between Georgia and
Abkhazia will reopen on June 30 under the chairmanship of UN mediator
Edouard Brunner, a UN spokeswoman said.
These "political talks" are likely to centre on the future status of
the breakaway region and on its relations with Georgia, Therese
Gastaut, the spokeswoman said.
