Garbage Disposal Updated 
Chinese citizens are undergoing some radical changes in almost every
aspect of their lives in the sweeping drive to modernize, including
even the most mundane of traditional tasks -- that of garbage disposal.
Sources in this capital city of Jiangxi province in east China say that
the city has already made great strides in this area.
The city now has a total of 21 tightly sealed garbage transfer depots
in operation, and they are expected to completely replace all the old
open garbage cans which have dominated the urban landscape for the past
20 or more years, Zhang Hua, a senior official with the city government
said, adding that 10 or more of the devices will be put into use by the
end of September.
Nanchang has 1.3 million people who churn out 1,400 tons of garbage
daily, which were scattered about the city in more than 1,000 open bins
that dot the avenues or small streets in the urban area. Since there
was no proper management, all this detracted from the beauty of the
streets and caused severe pollution and public sanitation problems.
In a drive to clean up the environment in the city proper, to build a
new image, the city has poured as much as 10 million yuan annually into
improving the sanitation conditions, since 1992, according to Zhang.
Some 30 containerized garbage transfer depots have been set up, the
depots were emptied regularly, and the garbage was carried off in bags
and in sealed containers. For this service, every household pays a
minimal fee monthly.
The garbage is hauled off to a mountain ravine 15 km to the north of
the city, where a garbage disposal plant has been built over an area of
120 ha, with a capacity that is supposed to be sufficient to handle all
the garbage, Zhang Hua was quoted as saying.
