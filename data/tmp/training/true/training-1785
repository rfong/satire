Oilers/VBZ Complain/NNP Refs/NNP Favored/NNP Cowboys/NNPS '/POS Aikman/NNP Sure/NNP ,/, the/DT officials/NNS called/VBD it/PRP both/CC ways/NNS Sunday/NNP afternoon/NN at/IN Texas/NNP Stadium/NNP ./.

First/RB ,/, there/EX was/VBD the/DT way/NN they/PRP called/VBD it/PRP for/IN 89/CD of/IN the/DT players/NNS on/IN the/DT field/NN ./.

And/CC then/RB there/EX was/VBD the/DT way/NN they/PRP called/VBD it/PRP for/IN Troy/NNP Aikman/NNP ./.

At/IN least/JJS that/DT 's/VBZ what/WP many/JJ of/IN the/DT Oilers/NNPS believed/VBD was/VBD the/DT case/NN at/IN two/CD critical/JJ points/NNS of/IN what/WP would/MD be/VB a/DT 20-17/JJ loss/NN to/TO the/DT Dallas/NNP Cowboys/NNPS ./.

``/`` Bleep/NNP the/DT officials/NNS ,/, ''/'' Oilers/NNP receiver/NN Ernest/NNP Givins/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Bleep/VB all/DT of/IN them/PRP ./.

We/PRP always/RB get/VB the/DT short/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT stick/NN ,/, so/RB bleep/VB them/PRP ./. ''/''

Obviously/RB ,/, feelings/NNS ran/VBD deep/JJ ./.

The/DT biggest/JJS gripe/NN the/DT Oilers/NNPS had/VBD with/IN Sunday/NNP 's/POS game/NN officials/NNS revolved/VBD around/IN two/CD calls/NNS ,/, although/IN there/EX were/VBD several/JJ others/NNS that/WDT proved/VBD to/TO be/VB huge/JJ ./.

The/DT first/JJ critical/JJ call/NN --/: or/CC non-call/JJ --/: came/VBD in/IN the/DT final/JJ two/CD minutes/NNS of/IN the/DT third/JJ quarter/NN ./.

With/IN good/JJ field/NN position/NN at/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ 41-yard/JJ line/NN ,/, the/DT Oilers/NNPS were/VBD racing/VBG the/DT play/NN clock/NN and/CC lost/VBD ./.

The/DT game/NN 's/POS back/JJ judge/NN ,/, Jim/NNP Poole/NNP ,/, whistled/VBN the/DT Oilers/NNPS for/IN a/DT delay/NN of/IN game/NN penalty/NN as/IN the/DT ball/NN was/VBD snapped/VBN ./.

Cowboys/NNP defensive/NN end/NN Charles/NNP Haley/NNP apparently/RB could/MD not/RB hear/VB the/DT whistle/NN and/CC barreled/VBD into/IN Richardson/NNP as/IN most/RBS other/JJ players/NNS were/VBD stopping/VBG play/NN ./.

Several/JJ Oilers/NNP players/NNS and/CC coaches/NNS walked/VBD a/DT few/JJ steps/NNS onto/IN the/DT field/NN protesting/VBG that/IN the/DT Cowboys/NNPS roughed/VBD Richardson/NNP ,/, but/CC referee/NN Ed/NNP Hochuli/NNP announced/VBD that/IN since/IN the/DT back/JJ judge/NN was/VBD the/DT one/NN who/WP whistled/VBN ,/, some/DT players/NNS did/VBD not/RB hear/VB that/IN play/NN was/VBD stopped/VBN ./.

No/DT penalty/NN ./.

``/`` That/DT was/VBD the/DT worst/JJS non-roughing/JJ call/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB seen/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ career/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Oilers/NNP quarterback/NN Cody/NNP Carlson/NNP ,/, who/WP was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT players/NNS arguing/VBG with/IN Hochuli/NNP ./.

One/CD play/NN later/RB ,/, tailback/NNP Gary/NNP Brown/NNP bobbled/VBD a/DT screen/NN pass/VBP from/IN Richardson/NNP ,/, Haley/NNP intercepted/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT Oilers/NNPS were/VBD left/VBN scrambling/VBG as/IN the/DT fourth/JJ quarter/NN approached/VBD ./.

Then/RB in/IN the/DT fourth/JJ quarter/NN ,/, the/DT scramble/NN became/VBD desperate/JJ when/WRB Hochuli/NNP made/VBD a/DT similar/JJ call/NN involving/VBG Troy/NNP Aikman/NNP ./.

It/PRP cost/VBD a/DT surging/JJ Oilers/NNP offense/NN precious/JJ time/NN off/IN the/DT clock/NN ./.

With/IN just/RB over/IN 2:30/CD remaining/VBG and/CC the/DT Oilers/JJ with/IN no/DT timeouts/NNS remaining/VBG ,/, Lamar/NNP Lathon/NNP stuffed/VBD Emmitt/NNP Smith/NNP on/IN first/JJ down/NN and/CC Ray/NNP Childress/NNP batted/VBD down/RP a/DT pass/NN by/IN Aikman/NNP ./.

Things/NNS were/VBD looking/VBG promising/VBG ./.

But/CC on/IN that/DT pass/NN attempt/NN ,/, Oilers/NNP linebacker/NN Eddie/NNP Robinson/NNP swatted/VBD the/DT side/NN of/IN Aikman/NNP 's/POS helmet/NN after/IN Aikman/NNP released/VBD the/DT ball/NN ./.

Hochuli/NNP called/VBD roughing/VBG when/WRB Aikman/NNP was/VBD involved/VBN and/CC by/IN the/DT time/NN Richardson/NNP got/VBD the/DT ball/NN back/RB in/IN his/PRP$ hands/NNS ,/, just/RB 22/CD seconds/NNS remained/VBD ./.

``/`` I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD clear/JJ to/TO everyone/NN that/IN I/PRP was/VBD trying/VBG to/TO stop/VB -LRB-/-LRB- before/IN hitting/NNP Aikman/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, ''/'' Robinson/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` That/DT 's/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP had/VBD my/PRP$ arms/NNS up/RB ,/, because/IN I/PRP was/VBD trying/VBG to/TO use/VB them/PRP to/TO slow/VB myself/PRP down/RP ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ hand/NN hit/VBD him/PRP on/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT helmet/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD obvious/JJ to/TO everyone/NN that/IN I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB taking/VBG a/DT shot/NN at/IN him/PRP ./.

I/PRP was/VBD just/RB trying/VBG to/TO stop/VB ./. ''/''

That/DT 's/VBZ not/RB the/DT way/NN Hochuli/NNP saw/VBD it/PRP and/CC the/DT Oilers/NNPS said/VBD there/EX was/VBD reason/NN for/IN the/DT differing/VBG interpretations/NNS ./.

``/`` There/EX 's/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN there/EX was/VBD a/DT difference/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN they/PRP called/VBD the/DT game/NN for/IN the/DT two/CD quarterbacks/NNS ,/, ''/'' Carlson/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` To/TO allow/VB Haley/NNP to/TO hit/VB Bucky/NNP like/IN that/WDT is/VBZ just/RB total/JJ crud/VBD ./. ''/''

Said/NNP Oilers/NNP kicker/NN Al/NNP Del/NNP Greco/NNP ,/, who/WP also/RB protested/VBD the/DT two/CD plays/VBZ :/: ``/`` Aikman/NNP barely/RB gets/VBZ hit/NN and/CC Bucky/NNP almost/RB gets/VBZ killed/VBD ./.

But/CC the/DT reason/NN it/PRP was/VBD called/VBN the/DT way/NN it/PRP was/VBD is/VBZ one/CD man/NN was/VBD Troy/NNP Aikman/NNP and/CC the/DT other/JJ was/VBD Bucky/NNP Richardson/NNP ./.

``/`` The/DT game/NN is/VBZ clearly/RB on/IN the/DT line/NN at/IN that/DT point/NN and/CC you/PRP just/RB do/VBP n't/RB make/VB a/DT ridiculous/JJ call/NN like/IN that/DT ./. ''/''
