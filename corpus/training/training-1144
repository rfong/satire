Church leader calls for compromise in peace process 
Ireland's senior Protestant cleric called Sunday on all sides in the
Northern Ireland peace process to make compromises before it is too
late.
Archbishop Robin Eames of the Church of Ireland, which covers both
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, told the BBC he was aware
of difficulties and problems in the process, but added: "Time is not on
our side."
"What is happening at the moment is not just a test for individual
parties and their outlook. (It) is a test of the political process," he
said.
British Prime Minister John Major acknowledged Saturday that the peace
process is bogged down, but insisted it was not dead. He and Irish
counterpart John Bruton said they would try to persuade all involved to
compromise.
"I am a veteran of being told the peace process is dead," Major said
after seeing Bruton on the sidelines of a EU leaders' meeting in
Dublin. "I don't believe it."
