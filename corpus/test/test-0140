Singapore government, property groups eye mammoth Hong Kong project 
Singapore's cash-rich state investment arm and a property firm, City
Developments Ltd. (CDL), have joined a consortium bidding for a massive
commercial development project in Hong Kong, officials said Wednesday.
The move is seem by analysts as a vote of confidence in the British
colony which returns to Chinese rule in July next year.
The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and CDL will
take a 10 percent stake each in the high-powered Hong Kong consortium
bidding for the 40 billion Hong Kong dollars (5.17 billion US) project
to be built above the territory's new airport railway station.
The Singaporean partners' proposed investment will be about 520 million
US dollars each, the officials said.
The consortium is led by two Hong Kong groups -- Singapore property
magnate Ng Teng Fong's Sino Land and Great Eagle (Holdings). At least
one other party from the territory, Manhattan Garments International,
is also said to be in the team.
GIC manages and invests Singapore's massive foreign reserves amounting
to 95 billion Singapore dollars (68 billion US).
"We see it as an area of opportunity, we expect fair returns and we
also see it as a good time to go in. We believe in the long term
viability of Hong Kong," said Gerry de Silva, spokesman for the Hong
Leong group which controls the Singapore-listed CDL.
The Hong Leong group is led by tycoon Kwek Leng Beng and CDL is one of
the largest property developers in Singapore.
Lam Yew Hung, analyst with J. M. Sassoon and Co. Pte. Ltd., described
CDL's foray into the Hong Kong property market as significant because
Kwek has been quite cautious in venturing far into the region,
confining property investments to Malaysia and Singapore.
"He has the knack of coming into the market when it is low and this
proposed investment in Hong Kong shows that he feels that the Hong Hong
property market is at a good price to move in," Lam said.
"It also bodes well for his view that Hong Kong's transition back to
China will be smooth and Hong Kong will prosper after that," he said.
Hong Kong office occupancy costs dropped 18 percent to 1,170 US dollars
per square metre (10.76 square feet) between January and September
1995, according to a Jones Lang Wootton survey released here last
month.
The proposed 4.4-million-square-foot (408,760-square-metre) Hong Kong
project will comprise three office towers, retail space and two hotels.
