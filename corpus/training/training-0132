China Bans Sale of Polluting Small Paper Pulp Machines 
China has banned the purchase and transfer of small chemical paper pulp
machines, and limited the purchase of medium-sized chemical paper pulp
machines.
In a recent emergency circular to local governments, the State Bureau
of Environmental Protection called on local authorities to adopt
measures to ban the purchase or transfer of facilities with a capacity
of producing 10,000 paper pulp annually by chemical means.
Such facilities cause serious water pollution problems, according to
the circular.
Purchase and transfer of similar facilities with bigger production
capacity must be strictly controlled, and must be approved by
provincial environmental protection bureaus, the circular said.
It said plants which purchase the facilities must equip themselves with
pollution-control equipment that meets the requirements of the State
environmental protection laws and regulations.
Wastewater discharged by those plants also must meet State
environmental protection requirements.
Enterprises which violate the regulation will be punished according to
State environmental laws and regulations.
The circular was issued when it was discovered small chemical paper
pulp facilities have been transferring from the Huaihe River Valley,
including the provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong.
The four provinces have been ordered to close hundreds of small
chemical paper pulp plants as part of central government's efforts to
clean the Huaihe River by 2000.
