Malaysia's Economy Contracts 6.7 Percent in 1998
Malaysia's economy contracted by 6.7 percent in 1998 when the full
effect of the regional financial crisis was felt, according to the 1998
annual report released by the Bank Negara (State Bank) Wednesday.
This was the first annual contraction of the country's real gross
domestic product (GDP) after 12 years of uninterrupted expansion
averaging 7.8 percent per annum. Even in 1997 when the regional
financial crisis erupted, real GDP grew by 7.7 percent.
Per capita income in nominal terms declined to 11,835 ringgit (about
3,018 U.S. dollars) in 1998 from 12,051 ringgit (about 4,284 U.S.
dollars) in 1997, according to the report.
In 1998, activities in all sectors were affected with the exception of
the mining sector.
Output of the manufacturing sector contracted by 10.2 percent in 1998,
the first decline since 1985, with output of the domestic-oriented
industries falling sharply by 13.4 percent owing to the severe
contraction in domestic demand, and that of export-oriented industries
by 7.3 percent reflecting the economic downturn in the Asia-Pacific
region which accounted for 40 percent of Malaysia's manufactured
exports.
The construction sector in the year under review experienced a most
severe contraction in output by 24.5 percent against a growth of 9.5
percent in 1997.
The sharp contraction in this sector was attributed to completion of
large projects, deferment of selected new infrastructure projects and
slow implementation of existing infrastructure projects as well as
postponement of non-residential projects.
The agriculture sector contracted by 4 percent in 1998, reflecting
declines in the production of all major commodities such as crude palm
oil and rubber affected mainly by adverse weather, labor shortage,
unfavorable prices, reduced cultivated area and lower yields.
However, value added in the mining sector increased further by 0.8
percent in 1998 against 1 percent growth in 1997, reflecting primarily
higher production of crude oil and gas increasing by 1.7 percent and
0.3 percent respectively, and a turnaround in tin production which grew
by 10.8 percent.
Following the contraction in the economy, the growth in the service
sector moderated in 1998, which recorded a growth rate of 1.5 percent
compared with 8 percent in 1997.
On the demand side, aggregate domestic demand declined, for the first
time since 1986, by 20.6 percent in current prices in 1998 against a
growth of 9.6 percent in 1997 and an average annual growth rate of
about 13.5 in the period 1987-97.
Total consumption spending declined by 6.5 percent in nominal terms in
1998 following an increase of 8 percent in 1997.
The contraction in total investment was significantly higher at 39
percent in nominal terms and 44.9 percent in real terms with private
investment declining by 53.3 percent in nominal terms.
In 1998, gross national savings continued to increase by 5.1 percent in
1998 despite the contraction in the domestic economy, thus bringing its
share in gross national product (GNP) to 41.2 percent against 39.4
percent recorded in 1997.
The balance of payments outturn in 1998 was much better than expected
with the current account recording an unprecedented large surplus of
36.1 billion ringgit (about 9.2 billion U.S. dollars), far exceeding
the 20.1 billion ringgit (about 5.29 billion U.S. dollars) surplus
projected in the 1999 budget announcement in October 1998.
Malaysia's overall external debt situation improved in 1998. The
country's total external debt outstanding declined by 6.4 percent to
159.8 billion ringgit (about 42 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of
1998 and short-term debt accounted for only 18 percent of the total
external debt against 25 percent in 1997.
In 1998, the gross international reserves held by the central bank rose
significantly by about 68 percent to 99.438 billion ringgit (about 26.2
billion U.S. dollars) at the end of 1998, a level sufficient to finance
5.7 months of retained imports.
In the year under review, the inflation rate increased by 5.3 percent,
but lower than the earlier estimates of 7 - 8 percent.
On the employment front, in the face of a contraction in domestic
economic activity, the unemployment rate is estimated to have increased
from 2.5 percent in 1997 to 3.9 percent in 1998, below the full
employment level of 4 percent.
In 1998, Malaysia's macroeconomic policy management focused on reducing
risks in the economy to ensure macroeconomic stability and promote a
stronger financial system.
The annual report said that overall, there are indications that the
trough in the growth cycle had been reached in the third quarter of
1998 and Malaysia ended the year on a positive note, with the
underlying economic conditions generally favorable.
Malaysia is expected to stage a recovery in 1999 with real GDP
recording a positive growth of 1 percent.
