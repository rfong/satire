Museveni maintains huge lead in presidential poll 
President Yoweri Museveni had a huge lead Friday as vote-counting
continued in Uganda's first direct presidential election since
independence in 1962.
The election Thursday pitted Museveni, seeking endorsement of the power
he seized 10 years ago after a five-year bush war, against veteran
politician Paul Ssemogerere and outsider Muhammad Mayanja, a Moslem.
With results in from close to half the 15,600 polling stations,
electoral commission tallies were:
Museveni: 2,350,265 - 82.7 percent
Ssemogerere: 434,726 - 15.3 percent
Mayanja: 55,487 - 2.0 percent.
Those figures represent 34.3 percent of the 8.5 million potential
votes, but is a much higher result of actual votes because of
abstentions.
Turnout appeared to be relatively high in the countryside but low in
big towns in this destitute east African country.
