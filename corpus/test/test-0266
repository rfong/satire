Mandela to complete South Africa's transition by signing new constitution
by Steve Matthewson
When President Nelson Mandela signs South Africa's new constitution
into law Tuesday, he will finally wrap-up the remarkable political
transition that was started by his predecessor almost seven years ago.
Mandela is due to endorse the basic law document at a public ceremony
at the site where apartheid police gunned down more than 69 unarmed
protestors in 1960, in the otherwise unremarkable township of
Sharpeville south of Johannesburg.
Chosen to coincide with International Human Rights Day, the event will
signal the end of what is often called the "negotiated revolution".
The dramatic process began in February 1990 when Frederik de Klerk, the
last in a long line of white presidents, released Mandela and other
political prisoners, opening the way for negotiations between oppressor
and oppressed.
Initially, the detente was fragile.
The first round of formal multi-party talks began in December 1991 amid
bloody political violence and accusations that de Klerk's government
was involved in "dirty tricks" against the black liberation movements
which were still struggling to transform themselves into bona fide
political parties.
The Convention for a Democratic South Africa, as the negotiating forum
was first known, collapsed five months later.
Only in 1993, after several political crises tested their relationship
to the limit, did the ruling National Party (NP) and Mandela's African
National Congress (ANC) agree on a "power-sharing formula" and "the new
South Africa" began to take shape.
Guided by the ANC's chief negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa and his NP
counterpart Roelf Meyer, party delegates at the World Trade Centre east
of Johannesburg agreed on an interim constitution that would provide
for the first all-race election.
In terms of this first basic-law document, runners-up in the poll were
guaranteed government seats and a "final" constitution would be drafted
by the new 490-member parliament, sitting as the Constitutional
Assembly.
While the deal satisfied the two main players, it was struck without
the sanction of Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom
Party (IFP), which abandoned the talks and threatened to boycott the
historic 1994 poll.
The constitution's failure to satisfy the IFP, the political home of
most of the country's eight million Zulus, remained its most glaring
flaw and came back to haunt negotiators.
Although the IFP was eventually persuaded to take part in the election
and took its seats as the third partner in the national unity
government, it again walked out of the Constitutional Assembly when the
last leg of the constitution-writing process began in 1995.
The IFP, whose supporters had been engaged in a bloody territorial war
with the ANC since 1985, warned it would not recognise a constitution
that did not grant greater autonomy for its KwaZulu-Natal province
stronghold.
Despite the IFP's boycott and occassional outbursts from the white far
right, and after 18 months of open hearings, last minute deals and
thousands of public sumbissions, the assembly passed the new basic law
document with the required two-thirds majority in May this year.
Even then, the powerful, new Constitutional Court, flexed its legal
muscle and sent the document back to the legislators to review eight
critical clauses, and only approved the constitution in early December.
Described as one of the most liberal in the world, the constitution
outlaws racial discrimination, guarantees full rights for homosexuals,
provides for abortion-on-demand and forbids capital punishment.
It entrenches South Africa's new political order, by scrapping the
interim multi-party government but guaranteeing multi-party
parliamentary elections and a host of basic rights, while restructuring
and streamlining parliamentary structures.
Its signing into law Tuesday marks the end of the transition and, with
officials moving to implement many aspects of the document in early
1997, it marks the beginning of the next election campaign.
