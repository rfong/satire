"Taiwan Independence" Means War: Army Paper
The article points out that putting an end to the separation situation
across the Taiwan Straits and realizing full reunification of the
motherland at an early date concerns the fundamental interests of the
Chinese nation and is an irreversible historic trend.
The Communist Party of China and Chinese government have showed great
sincerity and exerted enormous efforts to realize peaceful
reunification through the "one country, two systems" principle.
The article condemns "Taiwan Independence" and separatist forces who
have fabricated the "two-states statement" and continued their attempt
to split the motherland.
Recently the leader of the group who have always advocated " Taiwan
Independence" has used beautiful words to deceive the Taiwan people.
His recent "White Paper on Constitutional Policies" is in fact a
"declaration of Taiwan independence," the article says.
The article warns people not to be misled by his beautiful words.
It says that China is consistently opposed to any foreign forces to
meddle in the Taiwan issue and is against a handful of U. S.
congressmen who attempted to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan by
concocting the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act and utilizing all kinds
of pretexts.
"We hope for peaceful reunification. We know full well that Taiwan
compatriots long for peace. We don't want to see war and we believe
that Taiwan compatriots don't want to see war and don't want to see our
own flesh and blood resort to arms," the commentary says.
"We have the greatest sincerity for realizing peaceful reunification
and will try every means possible and do our utmost to seek peaceful
reunification," the article stresses.
"However, we must explicitly point out that 'Taiwan independence' means
war and separation will lead to no peace since 'Taiwan independence'
and separation can only undermine China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, can only separate Taiwan from the motherland and can only
make peaceful reunification of the motherland impossible," the article
says.
