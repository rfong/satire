Dollar Falls as German Central Bank Fails to Lower Rates
The dollar fell Wednesday after Germany's central bank declined to
lower interest rates and elation waned over the Clinton
administration's new balanced budget plan.
The decline in the currency began overnight in Tokyo, where traders
reacted with disappointment over Clinton's blueprint to lower the
budget deficit.
``The euphoria wore off,'' said Amy Smith, a currency strategist at the
financial analysis firm IDEA. ``He's not advancing any new agenda.''
Currency traders had thought Clinton would be more forceful about
restraining U.S. government spending, an important underlying reason
for the dollar's long-term decline in value vs. the yen and other key
foreign currencies. But Clinton's plan, as outlined in his Tuesday
night televised speech, would balance the budget in 10 years vs. the
seven proposed by the Republicans and cut taxes only for the middle
class.
The dollar came under further pressure when Germany's Bundesbank failed
to lower interest rates, as some foreign exchange traders had expected
it to do after a policy-making meeting on Wednesday.
Lower rates would have diminished the attractiveness of
mark-denominated investments, indirectly bolstering the dollar.
Although traders recognized that the reduction might not come at
Wednesday's meeting, ``the disappointment was vented on the dollar,''
Smith said.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 84.34 Japanese yen,
down from 84.63 late Tuesday. It also was changing hands in New York at
1.4010 German marks, down from 1.4085.
Another factor affecting the dollar was buildup of anticipation over
the meeting Thursday of the world's industrialized nations known as the
Group of Seven.
Traders speculated the central banks were unlikely to intervene in the
market to support the dollar immediately prior to or during the meeting
because they might be interpreted as a new policy.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday: 1.1545
Swiss francs, down from 1.1615; 4.9160 French francs, down from 4.9495;
1,640 Italian lire, down from 1,658; and 1.3796 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.3828.
The British pound was quoted at dlrs 1.6125, up from dlrs 1.5958.
