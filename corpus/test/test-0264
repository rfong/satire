G8 rewards Russia for anti-terror role with full G8 membership by Hugh Barnes
Russia was rewarded Wednesday with the promise of full membership of the
Group of Eight and the right to host a 2006 summit despite the puny size of
its economy, in a move seen as payback for President Vladimir Putin's
unprecedented support for the US-led war on terror.
Canada, the host of this year's G8 summit that opened Wednesday in the
Rocky Mountain resort of Kananaskis, immediately hailed a "historic
decision" to give Russia a permanent place on the top table of world
economies.
"In 2006, we have agreed that Russia will assume the presidency and
host our annual summit," the Canadian government said in a statement.
"The world is changing. Russia has demonstrated its potential to play a
full and meaningful role in addressing the global problems that we all
face."
A senior Japanese official said the 2006 summit decision "means Russia
will be a full G8 member," though it was unclear exactly when Russia
would assume full membership.
Until now, Russia has been allowed into the political discussions of
the G8 but excluded from financial meetings of the Group of Seven
powers -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United
States.
But in a clear sign that G7 leaders were eager to reward Putin's
unprecedented pro-Western realignment of Russia's foreign policy, the
Kremlin was admitted to a session devoted to financial issues.
From 2006, Russia will also participate in meetings of G8 finance
ministers, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's adviser, Alfred Tacke,
said.
Canada said the decision reflected what it called the "remarkable and
democratic transformation that has occurred in Russia in recent years
and in particular under the leadership of President Putin."
The decision to award Russia with full membership of the elite club of
the world's leading industrialised nations, owes more to Moscow's
strategic partnership with the West than to any obvious economic
credentials.
Russia's economy will have to grow by at least eight percent annually
for 15 years even to catch up with Portugal, one of the poorest
European Union nations, according to official government figures.
The country's economic growth registered at five percent last year
after a record rise of 8.3 percent in 2000 on the back of high oil
prices on world markets, although growth forecasts have been lowered
for this year.
However, Putin's top economic adviser Andrei Illarionov said on the eve
of the summit that having out-performed recent global growth figures,
Russia would be viewed as an equal partner in Kananaskis.
The promise of G8 membership is the latest sign the West is keen to
help Putin face off domestic critics who argue that Moscow capitulated
to the US-led coalition without extracting a discernible reward.
The United States announced earlier this month that Russia had
successfully completed the transition to a market economy, considering
the statement a sign the global financial community was ready to
welcome it into the World Trade Organisation.
Putin hailed the US decision as a "very important sign directed towards
the international community," and argued that it also showed "the
Russian economy is prepared to take part fully in the world economy."
The Russian leader defended his pro-Western stance before a skeptical
nation at a marathon news conference in Moscow on the eve of the G8
summit, saying partnership with Washington and Europe would decide
Russia's economic fate.
And G7 leaders gave a further signal that Russia could expect financial
rewards for its policy change in the wake of September 11 by drafting a
joint plan to safeguard Russian stocks of excess military plutonium.
The plan could see the United States commit 10 billion dollars to the
scheme over 10 years, a figure to be matched by 10 billion dollars from
the other six G7 states as part of a concerted effort to fight
proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
G8 leaders are expected to make a "significant" announcement on action
to cut down the level of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, a
spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said.
Dismantling Russia's stocks of military plutonium, which are viewed as
particularly susceptible to theft in the corruption-tainted post-Soviet
era, has become a main focus of international efforts to halt
proliferation.
