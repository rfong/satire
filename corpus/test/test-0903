Greek Government Appears Unwavering in ID Decision
The Greek government Wednesday appeared unwavering in its recent decision
to exclude religious affiliation from new state-mandated identity cards.
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said that the implementation of the law on personal data did not
concern religion and the identity cards but all the so-called sensitive
personal data and public documents.
He added that the Greek government had made clear its decision which
was to implement a law that had been approved by the Greek parliament.
The ID card furor erupted in earnest this month throughout the
predominately Orthodox nation of 11 million after a state- appointed
committee, the Authority for the Protection of Personal Data, conveyed
its opinion to the Greek Government-led by Prime Minister Costas
Simitis.
Describing the government decision on identity cards as "
authoritarian," Archbishop of Athens and All Greece Christodoulos
Wednesday accused the government of not respecting the agreement for
dialogue with the Church.
