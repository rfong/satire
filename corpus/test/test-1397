New Zambian president names government
Zambia's newly elected President Levy Mwanawasa named his cabinet Monday in
a major overhaul of the government, retaining only nine ministers and
scrapping five of the 24 posts.
"Today it is my intention to start on the major path to implement the
program in the new deal I spoke about," Mwanawasa told a news
conference, referring to his campaign pledge to reform the government.
"We shall demand honesty and integrity, and we shall demand the highest
standard of discipline," he said, vowing to stamp out corruption in
government.
In taking over from retired president Frederick Chiluba, Mwanawasa kept
Enoch Kavindele as vice president, and decided to take the post of
defense minister for himself.
Katele Kalumba, who was finance minister under retired president
Frederick Chiluba, is now foreign minister.
Emmanuel Kasonde, who was Chiluba's first finance minister, was again
tapped to fill that post, now renamed the minister of finance and
national planning, Mwanawasa said.
Mwanawasa also gave Kasonde one of the eight seats in parliament that
the president is allowed to appoint.
In reorganizing the cabinet, Mwanawasa scrapped the posts of minister
without portfolio and presidential affairs minister.
He combined the ministries of environment and tourism, made the
agriculture minister a deputy in the vice president's office and folded
the ministry of community development and social welfare into the labor
ministry.
That left Mwanawasa's cabinet with 19 posts. The only position yet to
be named is the new health minister. Two of the ministers are women.
Nine of the ministers were retained from Chiluba's government,
including information minister Vernon Mwaanga.
Mwaanga was accused of drug trafficking in the early 1990s, after
Chiluba first took office. That scandal was among the issues that led
Mwanawasa to resign as Chiluba's first vice president in 1994.
Mwanawasa told reporters he believed Mwaanga had reformed, but would
fire him if more evidence surfaced of ties to drug trafficking.
Among the other appointments, Mwanawasa named his close friend George
Kunda as legal affairs minister. Kunda is a respected lawyer and former
chairman of the Law Association of Zambia.
Another prominent lawyer, Mundia Sikatana, was charged with agriculture
in the vice president's office.
Chiluba's high-profile presidential affairs and legal affairs minister
Eric Silwamba was dropped from the cabinet.
Mwanawasa won the hotly contested presidential elections with just 28
percent of the popular vote, squeaking past opposition candidate
Anderson Mazoka of the United Party for National Development (UPND),
who garnered 27 percent.
Seven of the ten opposition parties that participated in the December
27 elections have disputed the outcome of the presidential polls and
vowed to organise nationwide protests against the new government as
well as to file a court challenge.
Mwanawasa said he had planned to name some opposition leaders to
cabinet posts, but would not do so until they stopped challenging his
presidency.
"It is not possible for me to invite any one of them at this time. Let
us finish litigating if that is their wish," he said.
