Expressway Built in Chinese Province 
A 70-km expressway linking Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi Province in
east China, and Zhangshu in central Jiangxi has been built and put into
use.
This is the second expressway built in Jiangxi. The first one, the
142-km expressway from Nanchang to Jiujiang City in northern Jiangxi,
was built with a 30 million US dollar loan from the World Bank.
The province is building an expressway linking Jiujiang and Jingdezhen,
a city known for its chinawares. The 134-km road is expected to be put
into use by the end of the century.
The three expressways are part of a 700-km expressway the province
plans to build along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, which runs across the
province.
