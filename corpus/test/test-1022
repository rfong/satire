Turkey Welcomes Greece's Attitude Towards 
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel said here today that
Turkey welcomed Greece's attitude which dropped its objections blocking
Turkey's participation in the activities of the Western European Union
(WEU).
Turkey expressed the hope that such kind of vetoes will be lifted
everywhere so that dialogue will be held between the two countries,
both NATO members, said Akbel at a press conference.
The spokesman said that Turkey's sincere wish is to initiate a
meaningful and comprehensive dialogue, adding "we hope that all these
efforts and developments will lead to dialogue atmosphere."
Greece opposes isolation of Turkey from Europe due to its religious and
cultural differences, Greek Ambassador to Turkey Dimitrios Nezeritis
said today in his letter to Ramazan Ozen, rector of Karaelmas
University in Zonguldak along the Black Sea of Turkey.
Nezeritis said in his letter that Greece harshly condemned such vague
approaches to isolate Turkey from Europe many times before and always
supported the view that Turkey should have its place in Europe.
Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen and his Greek
counterpart Yorgo Papandreu held "surprising" talks for a solution to
the problems between the two countries during the current
EU-Mediterranean Conference in Valletta, Malta, Tuesday evening and
today, according reports reaching here.
EU current President and Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo said
that the meeting between Oymen and Papandreu was important for the
solution of the Turkish-Greek problems, adding that efforts would be
continued in the coming days for solving the problems between the two
countries.
Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over a number of issues
including the limits of air space, mineral rights below the Aegean Sea
as well as the Cyprus issue.
