Central Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged from March 2 
The Central Bank left unchanged Thursday the rates it charges
commercial banks for capital.
After a regular meeting of the Bundesbank's central council, the
discount rate remained at 4 percent and the Lombard rate at 6 percent,
as expected.
The Bundesbank last changed the discount rate _ the cheapest form of
bank refinancing that acts as a floor for overnight money market rates
_ on March 31, cutting it by a half percentage point in response to the
rapidly strengthening mark and weakening dollar.
The move had no effect on the dollar's slide, and German officials said
it was up to the United States to do more to support its currency,
which is considered undervalued against the mark and the Japanese yen.
The Lombard rate has remained the same since May 13, 1994. Banks can
borrow emergency funds from the central banks at that rate, which acts
as a ceiling on overnight rates. (lak-fb)
