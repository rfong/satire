China to Build More Sugar Mills for Myanmar 
China and Myanmar signed a contract here today on building two more new
sugar mills in the country.
Under the contract between the China National Heavy Machinery
Corporation and state-run Myanmar Sugarcane Enterprise, the Chinese
firm will build the two sugar factories, each with a capacity of 2,000
tons of sugarcane per day.
Myanmar Minister for Agriculture and Irrigation Lt-Gen Myint Aung and
Chinese Charge d'Affaires Yu Tiegen attended the signing ceremony.
Last month, the China National Complete Plant Import and Export
(Yunnan) Corporation signed a contract with Myanmar to build two sugar
mills in the country.
Myanmar is rich in sugarcane resources, but sugar is still in great
demand. The country's sugar output in the 1996-97 fiscal year ended in
March was 76,000 tons with a per capita consumption of only 1.6
kilograms, according to official statistics.
