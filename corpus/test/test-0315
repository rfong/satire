Jails Sentences for Four Israelis over Jewish Olympics Deaths 
An Israeli court on Monday sentenced four Israelis up to 21 months in
jail, who were convicted of manslaughter for the death of four
Australians in a bridge collapse during the opening ceremony of the
1997 Maccabiah Games in Israel.
A group of 60 athletes also injured when the footbridge collapsed into
a polluted river during the ceremony of the Jewish Olymics in July
1997.
Miha Bar Ilan, the engineer who designed the footbridge, was sentenced
21 months in jail, plus 21 months suspended.
Two businessmen with the bridge construction company were each given
sentences of 15 months and two years suspended while the director of
public works, Adam Mishori, who assigned the project, was sentenced to
nine months in jail and 15 months suspended.
The former head of the games' organizing committee, Yoram Eyal, who was
convicted of manslaughter along with the other four defendants in
April, was ordered to do six months community service and serve an
18-month suspended jail sentence.
The five had faced possible prison sentences of up to three years for
causing death or injury through neglicence. Although they all had
expressed regret for the tragedy, they denied any responsiblity.
The bridge, built for 21,000 dollars, was described by the prosecution
as having flouted the most basic safety rules. It had been designed to
carry just 100 people when several hundred were expected.
But the five argued they had followed statutory requirements when they
built the footbridge.
The Jewish community in Australia has threatened to boycott the next
Maccabiah games and to stage protests at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
