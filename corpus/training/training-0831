Nigerian Vice President Calls for Adherence to Laws 
Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar Tuesday urged the country's
northern states to revert or adhere to the existing penal code.
The northern states should restore their situation to that before last
October when the Zamfara State announced it would adopt the Islamic
Sharia Law, said Abubakar while addressing an emergency meeting of the
Council of States in the capital city of Abuja.
"As far as Sharia is concerned, the nation will return to the status
quo ante," he told reporters after the meeting.
The Council of States is made up of the West African country's 36 state
governors, service chiefs in the federal government, former heads of
state and the federal attorney-general.
The participants of the meeting have made a decision "to restore
normalcy. ..and confidence among all communities" in the multi-ethnic
populous nation, which is secular by constitution, the vice president
said.
He said the existing penal code, which has already included provisions
for the Sharia Law, would continue to apply in the affected northern
states, but without the additions introduced by the Zamfara State.
According to Abubakar, Sharia had been part of Nigeria's penal code,
especially in the Moslem-dominated north, since the country won
independence from Britain in October, 1960.
The meeting was called up to study the situation after last week's
bloody clash over the introduction of Sharia in the northern city of
Kaduna, where some 300 people had been killed.
The incident was echoed nationwide and reportedly provoked a reprisal
in the eastern Abia State, where Christian population dominates, on
Monday, killing dozens of people.
