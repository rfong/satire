Translation snag halts hijacker remand hearing 
Translation trouble brought a halt to Thursday's remand hearing of an
Iranian who hijacked a plane carrying more than 170 people to Israel.
The Farsi interpreter failed to translate the key word "hijacking" from
Hebrew.
As a result the hearing was adjourned until someone with a better
command of the language could be found to help 30-year-old Jabari Rizah
understand the charges he faces.
Rizah, an air steward, fired a bullet into the cockpit of a domestic
Iranian flight heading to the Gulf holiday island of Kish on Tuesday
and ordered it to head west, Israeli officials said.
The plane was running out of fuel after being turned away by Saudi
Arabia and Jordan when Israel let it land at the Ovda air force base in
the Negev desert, 60 kilometres (36 miles) north of Eilat.
Rizah first requested political asylum in the United States but later
changed his mind in favour of Israel.
A foreign ministry official said the request would most likely be
rejected and Rizah would be handed over to the International Committee
of the Red Cross.
Five other passengers who reportedly asked for asylum were put back on
the lane.
The government allowed the Iranian Boeing 707 to return to Tehran on
Wednesday night after checking that none of the Iranians had
information on the fate of missing Israeli aviator Ron Arad.
He was shot down over Lebanon in 1986 and taken hostage. Israel
believes he could still be alive and says Iran holds the key to his
whereabouts.
