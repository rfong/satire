Iran Able to Produce Essential Military 
Iran's Defense Minister Admiral Ali Shamkhani declared on Wednesday
that Iran is "capable of designing and producing all essential hardware
for the defense sector."
Inaugurating eight projects of the defense industry under his ministry,
Shamkhani said the new defense hardware produced in Iran is a clear
indication of the vital role of defense industry in the country's
development.
Iran has been under a U.S.-imposed economic and military embargo since
the early 1980s. Short of spare parts to maintain U.S.-made weaponry
procured during the late shah's regime, Tehran's new rulers set up
their own defense industry to meet the needs in the eight-year war with
the Iraqis.
Shamkhani said his ministry is making use of all domestic industrial
capacities to realize self-sufficiency. During an air force drilling
last week, Iran took pride in its capability to produce spare parts for
maintenance and upgrading of U.S.-made F-14s.
Four days ago, the Defense Ministry issued a statement, denying that
Iran intends to conduct nuclear tests. Accused by the U.S. of seeking
unconventional capabilities, Iran said it is committed to preserving
the Persian Gulf and the Middle East a region free of nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons.
In July last year, Iran successfully tested "Shahab-3" (Meteor-3) with
a range of 1,300 kilometers, which meant it can hit targets in Israel,
Saudi Arabia and U.S. military bases in the region.
