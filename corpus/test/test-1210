Japanese Train Passengers Hospitalized After Bad Odor 
At least 29 people were taken to hospitals Wednesday after complaining
of stinging eyes and bad odors in train and subway stations in
Yokohama, a crowded commercial port city adjacent to Tokyo.
Japan has been jittery since a poison gas attack on Tokyo's subways
last month killed 12 people and sickened 5,500.
Police and firefighters said other people also were complaining of
dizziness and nausea.
Defense Agency officials said a military poison gas warfare unit was
being sent to the area.
NHK, Japan's public television network, showed police in gas masks
searching sections of the station.
It said there were no reports of people losing consciousness, and those
hospitalized appeared lucid.
A passenger, Kisuke Anamo, told NHK that he suddenly felt a stinging
feeling in his throat and then started coughing when he was walking in
an underground passageway in the station.
Other people also began coughing at about the same time, he said.
``I still feel dizzy and sick,'' he said.
The scene at the station was pandemonium. Thousands of people were
crowded onto sidewalks and streets outside the station. Sirens wailed.
Officials said 45 emergency vehicles were at the station, and at least
10 helicopters circled overhead.
A train where some passengers complained of illness was being
inspected, but otherwise train service had resumed, train officials
said.
Kyodo News Service said a white liquid was found in a corridor inside
the station.
National Public Safety Commission chief Hiromu Nonaka told reporters
that the air smelled like sulfuric acid.
On March 20, unknown assailants released a nerve gas, sarin, on five
subway trains in Tokyo during morning rush hour.
No one has been directly charged in that attack. A religious cult, Aum
Shinri Kyo, has become the chief suspect after police found tons of
dangerous chemicals at its facilities. Police said they also found
signs that the cult was involved in research on biological and other
weapons.
The cult has denied any involvement. Its leader, Shoko Asahara, had
predicted that something terrible would happen in Tokyo last Saturday.
Police mobilized more than 10,000 officers to guard downtown areas on
that day and nothing occurred.
On March 5, shortly before the Tokyo subway attack, more than 10
passengers were taken to a hospital in Yokohama after they inhaled
mysterious fumes in a train car and complained of eye and respiratory
pain. The source of the fumes was never found.
