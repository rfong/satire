Sharp rise in Japanese auto exports to US only 'temporary': Sato 
A recent sharp rise in Japanese auto exports to the United States was
"temporary" and unlikely to lead to renewed bilateral trade friction,
Trade Minister Shinji Sato reportedly said Wednesday.
Officials at the international trade and industry ministry quoted
Sato's remarks after talks with auto industry leaders, including Toyota
Motor Corp. president Hiroshi Okuda and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. chairman
Yoshifumi Tsuji.
Ministry officials also cited Sato as saying strong earnings by auto
makers were leading the economic recovery.
Auto exports to the United States, Japan's biggest trade partner, are
rising on the back of the yen's depreciation against the dollar,
causing fears bilateral trade friction may be revived.
Auto exports to the United States surged 75.3 percent from a year
earlier to 124,834 units in January.
Okuda was cited by the officials as saying strong exports to the United
States largely reflect declines seen last year.
