Factional fighting continues in Liberian capital
Monrovia awoke to the now familiar sound of heavy gunfire Saturday as
factional fighters continued to battle in several areas of the city.
Automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and shelling could be heard
from before 6:00 a.m. (0600 GMT) from the Mamba Point district, an area
housing several embassies and aid agencies, now largely deserted after
almost a month of factional clashes.
Local radio reported that the fighting was taking place in the city
centre and that gunfire could be heard from the direction of a bridge
leading to Bushrod Island, where Monrovia's freeport is located.
The fighting was continuing around 10:00 a.m. (1000 GMT).
Saturday's fighting comes the day after Roosevelt Johnson, the leader
of an ethnic Krahn faction, left Liberia for Accra, Ghana, where he is
due to attend peace talks called by the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) to resolve the current crisis.
Earlier this week, one of Johnson's main opponents in the fighting,
Charles Taylor, a co-president in Liberia's interim government, said
his forces would not abide by a ceasefire unless Johnson, who is wanted
for murder, gave himself up either to the government or to an authority
such as ECOWAS or the United Nations.
Taylor has chosen to interpret Johnson's departure, which he called "a
welcome development," as such a surrender, even though one of Johsnon's
spokesmen on Friday evening said this was not the case.
"Now that he's gone, we can get closer to a cessation of hostilities,"
Taylor said of Johnson in a radio broadcast Friday night.
The continued assault on the Krahns in Monrovia is therefore seen as an
attempt by Taylor to weaken Johnson's position before the Accra talks
open next Tuesday.
The Krahn factions, which include a branch of the United Liberation
Movement (ULIMO-J), the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and the Liberia
Peace Council (LPC), have their stronghold in the Barclay Training
Center (BTC), a downtown barracks housing AFL members and their
families.
The Krahns control the area surrounding the BTC, which forces loyal to
Taylor, who regards the Krahns as "terrorists," have been trying to
conquer, as yet with little success.
Most of Friday's skirmishes took place around this area, with the
frontline shifting constantly as both sides lost and gained ground
throughout the day.
Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation for tens of thousands of
non-combattant civilians in several displaced centres around the city
is deteriorating.
