Ghana's ruling party one seat from controlling majority 
Ghana's ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) has won its 133rd
seat in parliament and needs one more for an overall controlling
majority, the electoral commission announced Wednesday.
The last of the 200 seats will be contested later this month. If the
NDC wins that too, it will have the required two-thirds majority to
pass laws or amend the constitution.
Ghana's other seats are shared by the New Patriotic Party with 60, the
People Convention Party with five and the Peoples National Convention
with one.
The ruling party's latest victory was in Mfantsiman West on Tuesday.
Voting there was repeated because of problems with ballot papers when
the legislative elections were held on December 7.
NDC candidate Jerry Rawlings was re-elected as president as the same
time.
A court injunction relating to a candidacy dispute prevented voting
taking place December 7 in the last of the 200 constituenties still to
be decided.
