Peace activists fail in attempt to deliver food to Church of the Nativity 
Twenty-two peace activists who tried to deliver food on Sunday to
Palestinians trapped by the Israel army inside Bethlehem's Church of
the Nativity were stopped by soldiers, they said.
The foreign activists jumped barbed wire at Manger Square and reached
the doors of the church, which Christians believe marks Jesus Christ's
birthplace, Georgina Reeves, a British pacifist who led the action,
told AFP.
The demonstrators carried food and medical supplies but the Israeli
soldiers seized the supplies and stopped them from entering the
building, she said. The army pushed them back and hurled smoke bombs.
No one was arrested, said Reeves, a member of the pacifist
International Solidarity Movement.
Two-hundred gunmen, along with a number of clerics and civilians, have
been trapped inside the Church of Nativity by Israeli troops since the
Israeli army poured into Bethlehem on April 2.
Israeli-Palestinian talks have failed to find a way to end the
27-day-old Israeli siege but another round of negotiations was set for
Sunday evening.
