France-Mitterrand-DeGaulle,1 After battling De Gaulle, Mitterrand espoused
his ideas by Pierre Favier and Michel Martin-Roland
Francois Mitterrand spent years fighting the imperious Charles de
Gaulle only to espouse his style and the latter's lofty vision of
France's international role, when he came to power.
The relationship between Mitterrand and the war-time French leader was
never a smooth one and was marked for 30 years by misunderstanding,
animosity and political battles. The two men were alike in their
ambition for power and their tenacity in getting their way.
Mitterrand used to critise the "dictatorial" ways of De Gaulle but in
the latter years of his own mandate he too drew fire for being
authoritarian. He was dubbed "Dieu" - God - by the caricaturists for
his aloof and magisterial style.
Mitterrand, though of the next generation and of a different political
persuasion, came to adopt De Gaulle's vision for a France which could
stand on its own feet in defence and foreign policy and which did not
take its orders from anyone, notably Washington.
When General De Gaulle, then aged 50 made his historic appeal to the
French on June 18 1940 from London to join him in the fight against
Nazi Germany, Sergeant Francois Mitterrand, 24 was a prisoner of war in
Thuringia.
After escaping and returning to France, Mitterrand worked as a junior
official in charge of ex-servicement for the collaborationist Vichy
regime headed by Marshal Petain. Mitterrand once said that at the time,
he "had the stupid notion that Petain and De Gaulle were in agreement".
Mitterrand later joined the Resistance under the alias of Captain
Morland and a year later was dispatched to Algiers at the end of 1943
to meet De Gaulle.
The two did not hit it off. De Gaulle wanted Mitterrand to join his own
network under the command of his nephew Michel Cailliaud. Mitterrand
refused saying the "internal Resistance" had to remain independent.
In the summer of 1944, the quarrel appeared to have blown over and
thanks to the intervention of a friend, Mitterrand was included in the
government formed after the liberation of Paris.
De Gaulle stepped down in 1946 while Mitterrand went into parliament to
begin a long ministerial career in the Fourth Republic - a
parliamentary regime which De Gaulle contempuously dubbed the "regime
of the parties".
After the outbreak of the war in Algeria, De Gaulle returned to power
on May 13 1958 and Mitterrand was among the 224 deputies out of 329 who
voted against making De Gaulle prime minister.
Mitterrand lost his parliamentary seat in the autumn of 1958 in
elections won overwhelmingly by the gaullists and which opened the way
for the establishment of the Fifth Republic - a presidential regime
tailor-made for De Gaulle.
