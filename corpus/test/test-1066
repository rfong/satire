Iran, France Express Concern over Algerian Massacres 
Iran and France have expressed their concern over massacres of
defenseless people in Algeria, calling for cooperation between the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the European Union
(EU) to end the tragedy.
Tehran Radio Saturday reported that Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and his French counterpart Hubert Verdine discussed the
Algerian massacres Friday night in a telephone conversation, calling on
influential countries to help end massacre of innocent people in the
country.
Kharrazi stressed that Algiers should not interpret interest of other
countries in halting the killing of defenseless people in the country
as intervention in Algerian domestic affairs.
Following the massacre of over more than 1,000 Algerian people in
recent weeks, Kharrazi have contacted with foreign ministers of Italy,
Syria, Morocco and Greece during the past several days, expressing
Iran's deep concern over the issue.
He also sent letters to heads of the U.N. and the OIC, calling for
immediate measures to end the bloody killings of Algerian people.
Kharrazi and Verdine also reviewed further expansion of Tehran-Paris
relations, regional and international cooperation as well as
cooperation between the OIC and the EU.
