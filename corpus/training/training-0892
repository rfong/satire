Japanese business confidence improves in November 
Japanese business confidence improved in November with the diffusion
index for large manufacturers rising from minus seven to minus three,
the Bank of Japan said in a quarterly report Wednesday.
The central bank had forecast the diffusion index at zero in its last
short-term survey of economic enterprises released in August.
The index measures the difference between the number of responses with
a positive outlook towards the economy and those with negative
projections.
