It's Almost A Wrap As Final Panels Go Down
Climbers suspended by ropes rolled the last of 70 silvery panels down
the Reichstag's southeast tower on Friday, nearly completing Christo's
wrap of Germany's once and future parliament.
``Of course all the ropes and everything, the final fastenings, will
take a bit longer but everything should be down today,'' said project
spokeswoman Monika Dunhof.
High winds delayed the wrap on Thursday. The 210 workers, including 90
professional climbers, have lost time to rain and blustery winds, but
the weather has lent the project character.
The shiny aluminum-laced fabric draped over the 101-year-old symbol of
Germany's troubled 20th century has billowed and settled, constantly in
motion by Christo's design.
The wrapping began last Saturday and could have been finished Tuesday
with the best possible weather. Work stops when winds are stronger than
30 kilometers per hour (19 miles per hour).
The Bulgarian-born Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, who shares
equal credit on their projects, are covering the building with 100,000
square meters (120,000 square yards) of polypropylene and tying it with
nearly 16,000 meters (10 miles) of blue rope.
It is supported by a steel truss and anchored on the ground by 1,000
tons of steel weights.
The streets and lawns surrounding the sandstone structure have been
festive throughout, with mimes and musicians entertaining the tens of
thousands of people who come daily to watch the work. (fb-aa)
