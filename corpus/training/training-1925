Two US retailers to set up shop at Daiei's Hawaii mall: report 
Japan's largest supermarket chain operator Daiei Inc. has signed
contracts with two major US department store operators to set up
outlets at its Aramoana shopping center in Hawaii, the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun said Saturday.
Texas-based Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and Washington State-based
Nordstrom Inc. will open stores at the Aramoana mall within three
years, the major business daily said.
The shopping centre, the largest retail complex on the island, is
operated by the Daiei group, which will spend 26 billion yen (248
million dollars) on the expansion, it said.
Neiman Marcus aims to open for business in 1998 and Nordstrom in 1999,
the first outlets for both in Hawaii, it said.
The move is seen as a possible stepping stone into the Japanese market
for the retailers, the daily said.
The shopping center attracts large numbers of Japanese tourists.
