AIDS Patient Jailed for Unprotected Sex in Cyprus 
A Cypriot woman AIDS patient was sentenced to seven month imprisonment
on Monday for placing her sexual mates at the risk of contracting the
lethal HIV.
The 26-year-old defendant Chryssavghi Zarzour pleaded guilty before the
Nicosia District Court of having unprotected sexual intercourse with
two men and not informing them of her disease.
After passing the ruling, Judge Haris Solomonides said that strict and
deterrent sentences should be imposed to protect people's health from
the increased danger of spreading AIDS in Cyprus.
Zarzour is a British-born Cypriot hairdresser and came to Nicosia from
London in 1987. She is the second person charged with knowingly passing
AIDS virus.
Last July, Famagusta District Court sentenced fisherman Pavlos Georgiou
Kremastos to 15 months in jail for negligently passing HIV to his
British lover.
