Kenya's Economy Expected to Grow Next Year 
Kenya's economy will grow between 2 and 2.5 percent next year, the
country's Central Bank Governor Micah Cheserem said on Wednesday.
Kenya's economy will grow by 1.4 percent this year, against 1.8 percent
in 1998 and 2.3 percent in 1997, Cheserem said, adding this projection
is based on how fast the government moves to reform the civil service
and the judiciary, and improve the country's poor infrastructure.
He noted that if the government takes prompt actions to carry out
economic, judiciary and civil service reforms, especially if the road
network, telecommunication and services at the Mombasa Port are
improved quickly, the growth rate might be even higher than 2.5
percent.
He said the country's economy would also be boosted next year by the
resumption of aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The IMF suspended its 2.05 million U.S. dollar loans to Kenya in July,
1997 accusing the country of poor governance and official corruption.
In September, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi appointed a team of
technocrats to key civil service positions, cut the number of
ministries in nearly half and introduced new rules on the government's
procurement of goods and services in a bid to tackle corruption.
Cheserem also disclosed that an IMF team will visit Kenya for talks on
a new loan sometime after mid-January, next year.
The country's interest rates will fall in the middle of next year as
the government cuts expenditure, privatizes Telkom Kenya and sells its
remaining stake in Kenya Commercial Bank, he said.
