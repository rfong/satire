It's the bomb!
Yes! We finally did it. We created the father of all bombs. Let it be
known that I slapped many high fives when the bomb was successfully
exploded. The best part is, it's environmentally friendly!
It causes absolutely no harm to the environment, unless you count
humans as part of the environment. It kills them. But Russia will not
stop there with our bomb making. Oh no!
