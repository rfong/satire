Fire Destroys 9,000 Hectares of Forest in Chile 
A gigantic forest fire has destroyed 9,000 hectares of native trees in
the San Fernando zone of the Sixth Region, south of the capital.
The fire, which started last weekend, has continued despite the joint
action of 600 firefighters and seven helicopters, producing concern in
the neighboring population centers.
Aquiles Cornejo, mayor of San Fernando, said that up to midday Friday
33 persons have been lodged in a school. "In the school, there are six
families who lost their houses. There are five more who were also left
without a home, but are living with relatives," he said.
The Agriculture Ministry has ordered the National Forestry Corporation
"to work without budget restrictions to combat the fire," Cristian
Palma, executive director of the corporation, said Friday.
It was reported that the firefighting operations were hampered by
strong winds fanning the fire, making its control more difficult.
The cause of the fire, which has not been known so far, is beli eved to
be human activity, either intentional or otherwise.
