Manila bourse asks USAID to fund market surveillance project 
The Philippine Stock Exchange is to ask the US Agency for International
Development (USAID) for a 400,000-dollar grant to develop a market
surveillance system, a senior official said Tuesday.
Exchange president Eduardo de los Angeles told reporters it had engaged
the services of the team which helped design the New York Stock
Exchange surveillance system to design a model that would prevent
illegal activities such as insider trading and price manipulation by
brokerage houses.
The bourse is already the beneficiary of a 12.5 million-dollar USAID
capital market development project being implemented by the official
Securities and Exchange Commission and the private sector.
