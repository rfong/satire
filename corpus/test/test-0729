Riyadh ignores Amnesty protest over beheadings 
Saudi Arabia vowed Thursday to press on with beheading drug traffickers
and other criminals despite a protest by the human rights group Amnesty
International.
"We apply divine law and attach no importance to those who criticize"
the country's Islamic legal process, interior minister Prince Nayef Ben
Abdel Aziz told the official Saudi Press Agency.
London-based Amnesty last week urged its members to send protest
letters to King Fahd and Saudi embassies abroad after charging that the
"alarming" rise in executions resulted from trials that violated
international law.
Ninety-five people have been beheaded in Saudi Arabia in 1995, compared
to 58 for all of last year, according to a toll based on official Saudi
sources.
Riyadh has since 1987 applied the death penalty for convicted drug
traffickers, dealers and a repeat abusers. In 1989 a record 120 people
were executed in Saudi Arabia where Islamic law is strictly enforced.
