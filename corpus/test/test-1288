Mahathir says ASEAN membership would change Burma 
Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday that Burma's
early entry into ASEAN would be a more constructive way of speeding up
economic and political changes there.
"If we bring Myanmar (Burma) into the ASEAN fold, there will be things
that will rub off on them and they will be more willing to change their
economic and political system," he told a gathering organised by the
Harvard Clubs of Asia.
He was responding to a question on why Malaysia had been so supportive
of the Burmese authoritarian regime, which has been widely accused of
gross violations of human rights.
"We in ASEAN approach things in a different way, we persuade and do not
resort to arm-twisting people," Mahathir said, taking a swipe at the
United States for calling on countries in the region to impose
sanctions on Burma.
Mahathir, who is still hosting Burmese junta leader Than Shwe, on
Wednesday said that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
had nothing to fear from the United States if it accepted Burma as a
member.
Mahathir even wanted to see Burma become an ASEAN member by next year
to quicken the pace of change.
He told members of the Harvard Clubs that he believed ASEAN's policy of
"constructive engagement" towards Burma, which he admitted had been
viewed cynically by the West, had paid off handsomely.
"Myanmar (Burma) has changed now. There was a time it was isolationists
and there was total anarchy and people could not walk in the streets,"
Mahathir said.
Mahathir said the situation in Burma had improved although he agreed
that the Burmese government was not "totally benign."
"Myanmar (Burma) is more open and more prosperous now and there is
evidence that their people are now much more free to move around,
although not free in the sense of (democratic standards) from the
viewpoint of the West, but free to have a better life," Mahathir said.
"So we can see this constructive engagement policy has paid off," he
asserted.
He said it was more effective to use another developing country that
had experienced progress, like Malaysia, to influence improvements, "as
(Burma) can use Malaysia as a model for change."
ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, has been at odds with the United
States over how to handle Burma.
