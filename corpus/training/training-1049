German 1993 trade surplus is revised up to 60.966 billion marks 
The federal statistical office revised upwards the figure for the
German trade surplus last year by 1.8 billion marks to 60.966 billion
marks (38.6 billion dollars) on Monday.
Revising provisional figures which had been published in February, the
office said that exports had amounted to 628.5 billion marks which was
24.6 billion marks more than had been calculated, and imports had risen
by 22.7 billion marks more than had been initially reported.
The offices said that the revision was significant because of
difficulties encountered in calculating trade within the European Union
since the establishment of the single European market on January 1
1993.
The office also said that work on revision of figures for the first
quarter also suggested that the final figures would be higher than
those published provisionally.
