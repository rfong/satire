Romania Wants to be Vital Part of Asia-Europe Channel 
Romania Senate Chairman Petre Roman proposed that Romania must begin
its infrastructure preparations to make sure that it can be part of the
transportation and energy channel connecting Asia and Europe.
Roman made the remarks on Saturday night when he was just back from
Turkey after attending the Parliamentary forum of the organization of
economic cooperation in the Black Sea region.
Romania must keep a long-range foresight on the construction of the
channel to make sure that Romania can play a vital role in it, The
Romania News Agency on Sunday quoted Roman as saying.
The construction of the modernized passageway for transportation and
energy is a project connecting the mid-Asian countries and the Black
Sea area.
Although the project is still in planning stage, all related nations
have already begun competing each other trying to be a part of the
future passageway.
