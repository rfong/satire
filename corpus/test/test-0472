Actor Gene Kelly hospitalized with minor stroke 
Hollywood dancer and screen star Gene Kelly has been hospitalized after
suffering a minor stroke, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Hospital said
Monday.
The star of "Singin' in the Rain" suffered a serious stroke in July and
was hospitalized for seven weeks. He was re-admitted with a second
stroke on February 7, said spokesman Ron Wise.
"This stroke was not nearly the problem that the last one caused. This
was much smaller," Wise said.
Kelly, 82, appeared in about 50 movies during the 1940s and 1950s. "An
American in Paris," starring Kelly, won the Oscar for Best Film in
1951.
