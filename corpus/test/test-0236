Venezuelan colonel calls Chavez "undemocratic," says he must go 
Venezuelan Air Force Colonel Pedro Soto on Thursday publicly slammed
President Hugo Chavez, charging he leads a "non-democratic" government
and demanding that Chavez step down.
Soto's harsh criticism of the populist Chavez came on the heels of an
unusually blunt week of US criticism of the Venezuelan president.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell on Tuesday questioned Chavez'
commitment to democracy and the war on terrorism and criticized his
visits to countries like Iraq and Libya. Powell said Chavez was aware
of the complaints.
And on Wednesday, Central Intelligence Agency director George Tenet
told a Senate panel that he was worried about growing unrest in
Venezuela, which is the United States' third largest supplier of crude
oil.
"Domestic unhappiness with Chavez' "Bolivarian revolution" is growing,
economic conditions have deteriorated with the fall in oil prices and
the crisis atmosphere is likely to worsen," Tenet said.
Chavez charged late Wednesday "it's very clear (local groups of
opponents) are trying to upset that relationship (with the United
States) and convince Washington that the Hugo Chavez government
protects terrorists and needs to be targeted by the anti-terrorist
campaign."
"Washington must know that there is no terrorist plot in Venezuela,
only a democratic government that defends human rights," Chavez
insisted.
