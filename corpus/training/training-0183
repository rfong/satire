Japan's Obuchi Cabinet Resigns En Masse 
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's cabinet resigned en masse
Tuesday evening to pave the way for Obuchi's successor to form a new
cabinet.
Yoshiro Mori, secretary general and the No.2 figure of Obuchi's Liberal
Democratic Party, is most likely to succeed Obuchi as party leader and
hence Japanese prime minister, political sources said.
At 7 p.m. (1000 GMT), the cabinet convened an emergency session at
which all ministers resigned.
The cabinet's resignation is based on Article 70 of the Japanese
Constitution, which states that all cabinet ministers must resign when
there is a vacancy in the post of the prime minister.
The cabinet resigned as Obuchi is unlikely to recover in the near
future from the massive stroke he suffered on Sunday.
