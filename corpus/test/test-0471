UNHCR urges action to reach refugees in Zaire 
The UN refugee agency expressed frustration Friday over the
international community's lack of action in eastern Zaire and urged it
again to help humanitarian agencies reach almost 600,000 refugees still
marooned in the region.
"Sadly, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to locate
substantial numbers of refugees and distressed people out in the
forests and hills of Zaire," UN High Commissioner for Refugees chief
Sadako Ogata said in a statement.
"We cannot simply stand idly by, frustrated at every turn as we try to
carry out humanitarian missions. We need access to these people."
Since fighting forced hundreds of thousands of refugees out of camps
starting mid-October, Ogata has called on the international community
to provide security and logistical support to help access the refugees
and make it possible for them to return to Rwanda.
Ogata has stopped short of calling for military intervention but she
has gone on record several times in press interviews for favouring a
formed of multinational force to help channel aid to those stranded in
the heart of Africa.
The UNHCR counted 1.2 million refugees in eastern Zaire before fighting
erupted between Zairean Tutsi rebels and Zairean government forces.
Since November 15 some 562,000 Rwandan refugees have returned home from
Goma leaving 578,000 unaccounted for, in addition to thousands of
displaced Zaireans, the UNHCR said.
The United States and Rwanda have disputed these numbers and Canadian
officials believe a proposed multinational force is no longer justified
given the repatriations.
France still continues to back intervention and a Franco-African summit
in Ouagadougou Friday asked the UN and Organization of African Unity to
do what they could for the cause.
The UNHCR said aerial photos had revealed the presence of about 250,000
refugees and displaced people in three large groups between 75 and 100
kilometres west of Lake Kivu, which it had not been able to reach.
Ogata said she was "encouraged by reports that the returnees have been
generally well received, despite summering tensions that local
authorities are attempting to control."
