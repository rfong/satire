"Realizing that California voters are not buying their risky 550 billion
dollar tax scheme, the Dole campaign has switched gears in a desperate
attempt to win over voters at any price," said a statement from the Clinton
campaign.
The president has enjoyed a wide lead throughout the political season
and has generally avoided such controversial issues, preferring to
focus on the good economic news -- the top concern cited by most
voters.
The White House said half of the improvement in fiscal 1996 was due to
the good performance of the US economy and half to the Clinton
administration's cost-cutting policy.
But Dole has argued that Clinton is taking credit for the fruits of the
Republican majority in Congress which succeeded after a long battle in
getting him to accept a plan to balance the budget by 2002.
And Monday Dole defended his tax cuts from detractors who say the
economic plan is the result of an election-year conversion following
decades of championing budget balancing over revenue relief.
"We can eliminate a lot of programs," he said on a CNN interview,
arguing that the budget can be balanced along with tax cuts "if the
government will pinch pennies instead of the American people."
Dole has tried to divert the public's attention from the economy to
ethics, charging that Clinton has sullied the institution of the
presidency with everything from his Whitewater financial scandal to
joking about marijuana use.
But polls show that while many voters believe Clinton has a "character"
problem, most agree with the president that they are better off than
they were four years ago.
