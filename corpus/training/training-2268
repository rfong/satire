B2 bombers succeed in high-altitude precision test bombing 
For the first time US stealth bombers have succeeded in striking a
series of targets using munitions aided by both radar and a satellite
global positioning system, the Pentagon said Thursday.
Three B2 bombers destroyed 16 targets using 16 bombs dropped from an
altitude of 12,300 meters (40,590 feet) over the Nevada desert October
8, Brigadier-General Tom Goslin told reporters.
The new weapons, designed for use night or day in any weather, are
900-kilo (1,980-pound) bombs equipped with a satellite positioning
system.
The B2 bombers dropped their bombs about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles)
above their targets after taking two radar "photographs" to refine the
satellite readings and make the firing more accurate.
The margin of error of the new weapons systems -- which cost more othan
192,000 dollars each -- is less than six meters (20 feet), Goslin said.
The new system "significantly increases America's ability to strike
targets anytime, anywhere and through any weather," he said.
The B2 bomber, which can be sent anywhere in the world within 24 hours,
has been in service since 1993.
