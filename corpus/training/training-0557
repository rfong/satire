Chinese bank provided 50 million US to bail out HK's Tung: report 
A state-owned Chinese bank contributed nearly half of a
120-million-US-dollar package that saved the troubled shipping empire
of Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's future leader, the Far Eastern Economic
Review said Wednesday.
In a press statement trailing a story in Thursday's edition, the Hong
Kong-based news weekly said it had resolved part of the mystery
surrounding the funds that saved Tung's firm, Orient Overseas, from
bankruptcy in the mid-1980s.
The mainland-controlled Bank of China provided 50 million out of the
120 million dollars put together by Henry Fok, a local pro-China
tycoon, the statement said.
Apart from Fok and the Bank of China, another big contributor was China
Merchants, a Hong Kong arm of China's transport ministry.
Last year Tung, campaigning for office confirmed for the first time the
amount of the bailout and said the money came from "Chinese friends."
He has said that he did not know the sources of the money.
Neither Tung nor the Bank of China would comment on the issue, the
statement said.
Tung, who was chosen by a group of Chinese appointees to replace
Governor Chris Patten as Hong Kong's next leader, will take power in
July when China assumes sovereignty here.
He has been a fierce champion of all China's plans for Hong Kong's
future, including the scrapping and replacing of the legislature and
the amendment or abolition of key human rights legislation.
The Bank of China, was mandated in 1952 to manage the mainland's
financial relations with other countries. It is one of five state-owned
banks that specialise in various sectors of the economy.
China's central bank is the People's Bank of China.
