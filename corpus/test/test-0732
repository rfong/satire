Giant Project Offers Central China Province New Opportunity 
Central China's Hubei province had come across a rare opportunity for
growth as it plays host to the site of the Three Gorges Project,
China's largest ever water conservation project.
Provincial Governor Jiang Zhuping voiced the common wishes of the 57
million people in his province when he said Hubei will go all out to
ensure that the project will be carried out successfully.
Jiang acknowledged that market demand created by the huge investment of
the project will produce a tremendous positive impact on Hubei's
economic growth, and that the huge amount of labor force, building
materials, electronic and machinery products, construction equipment,
and farming and sideline produce required by the project are precisely
the competitive trades of Hubei's economy.
"In the meantime, the Three Gorges Project is also helping the province
open wider to the outside world," he added.
The Three Gorges area was a relatively underdeveloped area owing to
poor communications and fund shortage, Jiang said, adding that the
project will help the area get rid of poverty as the local environment
for investment and communications facilities have improved greatly
since the project started in 1993.
A 350-km expressway from Yichang, the nearest city to the project site
at Sandouping, to the city of Huangshi has been open to traffic, and a
60,000-end program controlled exchange and the Three Gorges Airport
have gone into service.
Yichang is now a city which has been designated by the state to open to
outside investment, while the Three Gorges area has been cited as an
open and development area.
When the project is in full swing after the damming of the Yangtze on
November 8, Jiang noted, even more funds will be injected into the
project, and Hubei province will prompt more local businesses to bid
for the project and promote the restructure of product mix in the Three
Gorges area.
Moreover, Hubei has worked out some 230 investment projects for the
area, which are expected to draw a total investment of 28 billion yuan,
and plans to build Yichang into China's largest hydropower center, a
major base for chemical industry, and a world-class tourism city with a
population of one million to 1.2 million, according to Jiang.
The governor expected the city of Yichang to help advance economic
development in the entire southwestern part of Hubei province.
