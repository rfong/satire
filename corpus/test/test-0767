Attempted jailbreak leaves one dead, several injured 
At least one person was killed and several others injured in an
attempted jailbreak from the overcrowded prison at Gitamara in central
Rwanda, UN and government officials said here Tuesday.
Soldiers guarding the prison fired about 100 shots during Monday's
incident, a spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda (UNAMIR)
said, adding that he did not have full details.
A justice ministry official said the troops opened fire when some
prisoners tried to escape following a scuffle, adding that violence
among detainees was frequent in the jail, the most packed in the small
central African country.
The prison director is a civilian, but for lack of staff, soldiers of
the Tutsi-dominated army serve as wardens. The prisoners are mainly
Hutus accused of taking part in genocide during a three-month civil war
last year.
According to the justice ministry, about 7,000 prisoners are held in
the Gitarama jail. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC),
which last week raised the alarm about appalling prison conditions,
estimates that the Gitarama jail is one was the most overcrowded in
Rwanda.
The ministry stated that some prisoners at Gitarama were due this week
to be transferred to detention centres elsewhere.
The violence came the day detainees in Kigali said eight prisoners
accused of taking part in the massacre of Rwandan Tutsis and opposition
Hutus will be brought to trial in the capital on Thursday.
Justice Minister Alphonse-Marie Nkubito had already said Sunday that
the trials would begin on April 6, the anniversary of the incident that
sparked the slaughter of at least 500,000 people by extremists from the
Hutu majority.
The charge sheet, written in Kinyarwanda and translated for AFP, said
the eight defendants were accused of having "participated in the
operation of genocide against Tutsis and all those who did not share
the views of the MNRD and the CDR".
The Republican National Movement for Development and Democracy (MNRD)
was the party of president Juvenal Habyarimana, whose death in a
suspicious plane crash on April 6 last year triggered three months of
organised bloodletting. The Campaign for the Defence of Democracy (CDR)
was an extremist Hutu party.
The Kigali jail alone, built to house 2,000 prisoners, was Monday
packed with 8,501, including 7,523 men, 258 women and 206 minors.
Sixty-four small children were also jailed with their mothers. Most of
them sleep outside on plastic sheeting, into which they roll themselves
when it rains.
