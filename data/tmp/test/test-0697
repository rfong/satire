Australian/NNP Zoologist/NNP Reveals/VBZ Coral/NNP Reef/NNP Mystery/NNP An/DT Australian/JJ zoologist/NN has/VBZ discovered/VBN a/DT new/JJ way/NN to/TO understand/VB the/DT formation/NN and/CC destruction/NN of/IN coral/JJ reefs/NNS around/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

Alan/NNP Marshall/NNP of/IN the/DT School/NNP of/IN Zoology/NNP of/IN La/NNP Trobe/NNP University/NNP in/IN Melbourne/NNP said/VBD that/IN there/EX might/MD be/VB an/DT unknown/JJ force/NN behind/IN the/DT formation/NN of/IN coral/JJ reefs/NNS ,/, other/JJ than/IN the/DT widely/RB believed/JJ effect/NN of/IN coral-algae/JJ interactions/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ traditionally/RB believed/VBN that/IN algae/JJ living/NN in/IN coral/JJ cells/NNS help/VBP to/TO accelerate/VB the/DT calcification/NN process/NN of/IN polyps/NNS in/IN the/DT formation/NN of/IN coral/JJ reefs/NNS ./.

But/CC experiments/NNS carried/VBN out/RP by/IN Marshall/NNP showed/VBD that/DT coral/JJ polyps/NNS without/IN algae/NN in/IN their/PRP$ cells/NNS calcify/RB at/IN the/DT same/JJ rate/NN as/IN those/DT with/IN algae/NN ./.

This/DT proved/VBD that/IN coral/NN is/VBZ not/RB relying/VBG on/IN the/DT algae/NN to/TO carry/VB out/RP its/PRP$ calcification/NN ,/, instead/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ helping/VBG the/DT algae/NN by/IN producing/VBG the/DT carbon/NN dioxide/NN it/PRP needs/VBZ ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ./.

His/PRP$ discovery/NN has/VBZ turned/VBN the/DT traditional/JJ explanation/NN of/IN the/DT formation/NN of/IN coral/JJ reefs/NNS upside/RB down/RB ./.

He/PRP said/VBD that/IN there/EX are/VBP two/CD types/NNS of/IN coral/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

One/PRP has/VBZ algae/VBN in/IN it/PRP and/CC the/DT other/JJ does/VBZ not/RB ./.

The/DT traditional/JJ theory/NN was/VBD only/RB based/VBN on/IN the/DT observation/NN that/IN calcification/NN rate/NN of/IN the/DT first/JJ type/NN of/IN coral/NN was/VBD faster/RBR during/IN day/NN time/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT algae/NN carried/VBD out/RP photosynthesis/NN ./.

The/DT process/NN was/VBD much/RB slower/JJR at/IN night/NN when/WRB the/DT algae/NN 's/POS photosynthesis/NN was/VBD not/RB active/JJ ./.

The/DT algae/NN might/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO switch/VB off/RP the/DT calcification/NN process/NN of/IN coral/JJ polyps/NNS at/IN night/NN ,/, because/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB need/VB much/JJ carbon/NN dioxide/NN when/WRB its/PRP$ photosynthesis/NN stops/VBZ ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ./.

But/CC the/DT traditional/JJ theory/NN ignore/VBP what/WP was/VBD going/VBG on/RP in/IN coral/JJ cells/NNS without/IN algae/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` My/PRP$ speculation/NN is/VBZ that/IN there/EX must/MD be/VB other/JJ unknown/JJ factors/NNS that/WDT controls/VBZ the/DT formation/NN of/IN coral/JJ reefs/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

Scientists/NNS have/VBP yet/RB to/TO explain/VB why/WRB polyps/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP only/RB four/CD cell/NN layers/NNS thick/JJ ,/, spend/VBP hundred/CD of/IN years/NNS to/TO develop/VB such/PDT a/DT large/JJ lime-stone/JJ skeleton/NN ./.

Coral/JJ reefs/NNS cover/VBP two/CD million/CD sq/NN km/NN of/IN the/DT global/JJ surface/NN ./.

The/DT biggest/JJS one/NN ,/, the/DT Great/NNP Barrier/NNP Reef/NNP in/IN Australia/NNP ,/, extends/VBZ 2,000/CD km/NN ./.

Another/DT mystery/NN is/VBZ ``/`` coral/JJ bleaching/NN ,/, ''/'' which/WDT is/VBZ widespread/JJ in/IN equatorial/JJ tropics/NNS ./.

Coral/JJ bleaching/NN happens/VBZ when/WRB sea/NN temperature/NN rises/VBZ ,/, with/IN coral/NN expelling/VBG the/DT algae/NN from/IN its/PRP$ body/NN ./.

After/IN the/DT algae/NN is/VBZ driven/VBN off/RP ,/, the/DT coral/NN dies/VBZ ./.

There/EX are/VBP speculations/VBG that/IN global/JJ warming/NN may/MD be/VB responsible/JJ for/IN coral/JJ bleaching/NN ./.

Marshall/NNP 's/POS discovery/NN will/MD help/VB to/TO explain/VB these/DT mysteries/NNS by/IN looking/VBG the/DT process/NN of/IN coral/JJ reef/NN development/NN in/IN a/DT different/JJ way/NN ./.
