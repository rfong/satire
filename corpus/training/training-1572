Malaysia Condemns Israeli Bombardment Of Lebanon 
Malaysia today condemned Israel's bombardment of southern Lebanon and
asked the United Nations to urge Israel to stop the air strike.
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told a press gathering
here today that Israel should immediately stop the attacks and withdraw
from Lebanon. Israel's acts could jeopardize the peace process in the
region.
Abdullah said, "The continuous attacks on Lebanon towns and villages
constitute a violation of the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon
and are in direct defiance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425
which calls on Israel to unconditionally withdraw from the Lebanese
territory."
He said that the "excessive and indiscriminate" acts by Israel have
caused wanton destruction of property and loss of innocent lives among
Lebanese citizens.
He urged the Security Council to press Israel to stop the attacks and
withdraw from Lebanon.
A total of 35 Lebanese civilians were killed and more than 140 others
wounded in air raids and bombardments at various areas of Lebanon,
including Beirut's southern suburbs in the past seven days since Israel
started the aggressions last Thursday.
