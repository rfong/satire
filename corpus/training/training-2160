Syria, Israel To Reopen Talks Soon: Christopher
Israel and Syria will reopen negotiations soon in Washington with their
military chiefs of staff joining in, U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher announced here today.
He did not announce a specific date, only said it would be "in the next
couple of days."
He added that Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for Middle East peace
process, will return to the Middle East in about two weeks for further
discussions with Israeli and Syrian officials.
Ross will participate in the discussions. Israel, Syria and the United
States will form a committee to oversee the negotiations, said reliable
sources.
The Israeli-Syrian talks, with the participation of their military
chiefs of staff, broke down in December in Washington.
Ambassadors Itamar Rabinovich of Israel and Walid al-Moualem of Syria
will handle the negotiations. The talks are expected to focus on the
security arrangements to be installed after Israel's likely pullback on
the Golan Heights the Jewish state captured in 1967.
The U.S. top diplomat described his current Middle East shuttle
diplomacy as "one of the most satisfying trips I have made to the
Middle East."
On Sunday, Christopher and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad discussed
the creation of demilitarized zones, depletion of Israeli and Syrian
troops in other zones and installation of early-warning systems to
guard against surprise attack.
Earlier today, Hafez al-Assad met here Christopher as soon as the
latter arrived here from Israel.
This is their second meeting during Christopher's current Middle East
tour which is aimed at activating the regional peace process.
Diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital believe that Christopher's
second visit to Damascus during his current Mideast tour is an
important and encouraging sign to indicate the progress made by
Christopher toward resuming the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations.
Atmospheres of optimism are currently prevailing the Syrian capital.
