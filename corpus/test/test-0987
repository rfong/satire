"Germany paying too much for Europe" becomes election theme
Leading political figures, both on the right and left, have made an
electoral theme of Germany's big financial contribution to the European
Union (EU), suggesting that the level should be reduced.
With the European elections less than two weeks away, both Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and opposition Social Democrat party (SPD) leader Rudolf
Scharping at the weekend took up the theme, which has become a
favourite of the anti-Maastricht campaigners.
Economic authorities have added their weight to the argument.
According to the central bank, Germany pays the highest contribution to
the EU budget, both in absolute terms and per head of population,
although the average German's standard of living has fallen to sixth
place in the EU since west Germany and the poorer eastern part of the
country were rejoined.
The vice-president of the European Investment Bank, Wolfgang Roth, also
said at the weekend that the German contribution was "objectively" too
high, as it had not been reviewed since the 1990 reunification.
He said it should take into account the fact that "a quarter or a fifth
of Germany now has the social and economic conditions of production as
those in Portugal or Greece, for example, or even a bit worse."
For Roth it was clear, on the other hand, that France and above all
Britain did not pay enough.
Speaking in a parliamentary debate on Europe, the Christian Democrat
Kohl said that in future national contributions to EU coffers should
take greater account of revenue per head.
The German aim was to get those countries which had a comparable per
capita income to "accept more financial responsibilities than in the
past", the chancellor said, stressing that Germany's capacity to pay
had reached its "extreme limit".
However Kohl rejected calls for an immediate reduction of Germany's
share, and said it was normal that Germany pay the most as it was
Europe's leading economic power.
The premier of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber, said it was unfair that Germany
bore 30 percent of the EU budget but received only 14.6 percent of
agricultural subsidies and, despite reunification, only some 12 percent
of restructuring funds.
Coming from Stoiber, who caused a stir at the end of last year with
"Euro-sceptic" pronouncements, the theme was of no great surprise.
But even the "pro-Europe" SPD says the contributions cuts that Britain
has won in order to calm down its own Euro-sceptics, and which
Germany's contributions are seen as making up for, should be cancelled.
Scharping, who hopes to replace Kohl as chancellor after legislative
elections in October, attacked the German government for "talking big
and then doing the opposite".
He accused it of saying the German EU contribution had to be reduced,
and then at the 1992 Edinburgh summit agreeing they continue at their
present level until 1999.
Replying to Stoiber, the head of the small Free Democrat Party, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel, acknowledged that Germany paid the biggest
contribution, but maintained that it was also "by far the greatest
beneficiary".
