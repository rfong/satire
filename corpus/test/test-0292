Sierra Leone Victims to Brief Senior U.N. Official
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here that the
U.N. special representative of children and armed conflict, Olara
Otunnu, has made the invitation to the briefing at the U.N.
headquarters in New York.
The victims -- a group of amputees, which includes children -- are
currently in the United States for medical treatment, the spokesman
said.
They will be the first group of victims from the West African country,
which has been plagued by the nine-year civil war, to brief U.N.
officials and NGOs.
The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which violated a peace
accord in May by reigniting the conflict in Sierra Leone, is accused of
cutting off limbs, looting and raping in the conflict.
Foday Sankoh, the RUF leader, who was arrested in June, is now in the
government custody. He is likely to be tried for the violation of the
international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law.
