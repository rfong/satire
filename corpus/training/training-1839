Spokesman on Nationalities, Right of Abode of HK Residents (7)
Referring to the settlement in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, mentioned in
the transitional arrangements, the spokesman said people are
responsible for convincing the Immigration Department that they have
settled in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, but they do not have to be in
Hong Kong on that day.
The spokesman also pledged that the right of entry into Hong Kong will
be granted to those non-Chinese nationals who lose the status of
permanent Hong Kong residents due to the above stipulations and
transitional arrangements, in order not to influence their life and
work in Hong Kong. They will be free to enter and leave Hong Kong, and
live and work in the region without restrictions, he explained.
He said the issues of nationalities and the right of abode of the Hong
Kong residents concern the practical interests of everyone in Hong
Kong.
Since there are basic laws and policies in this regard, he said he
hopes that the Hong Kong SAR government will work out the specific
stipulations as soon as possible.
The spokesman also said the Chinese government has always solicited
opinions from the British side while drawing up the policy on the right
of abode of the Hong Kong residents, and still welcomes the British
side to offer its opinions.
