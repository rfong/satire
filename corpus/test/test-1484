China to Start International Mail-Order Service 
China's Posts and Telecommunications departments are working with their
U.S. counterparts to establish a Global Package Link Service for the
Chinese market, including Hong Kong.
The service will enable Chinese consumers to order and purchase
commodities listed in the international market without the need to
travel abroad, according to recent edition of International Trade News.
The service will initially be offered in Shanghai, China's largest
metropolitan area, and later in various other major cities, including
Beijing and Guangzhou.
The newspaper called the service a result from the strategic
cooperation between the postal services of China and the United States.
In addition, similar services between China and Japan and Russia are
currently under negotiation.
