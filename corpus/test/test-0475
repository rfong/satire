US says military situation "normal and stable" 
The United States believes the military situation in the hours
following the death of President Kim Il-Sung "is normal and stable", a
senior US official said here Saturday.
Speaking to reporters at the US mission in the Swiss city, an official
said: "As far as we know the military situation is normal and stable in
North Korea."
"There is no indication of any abnormal development in this regard," he
added.
"The only thing I can tell you is that South Korean armed forces' leave
has been cancelled, this is not necessarily an alert," he said.
The US comment came after foreign embassy officials were quoted as
saying that the North Korean capital was quiet Saturday despite
individual shows of mourning by Pyongyang residents.
"The people were clearly very shocked by the news and many were openly
weeping in the streets," Indian Ambassador to North Korea S. Kipgen
said by telephone, contacted from Beijing.
"The children coming home from school at noon were all in tears," he
added.
Kipgen stressed, however, that the general situation in the capital was
quiet and normal following the announcement around 11:00 a.m. that Kim
had died from a heart attack.
"The shops are all open and no communications have been interrupted and
I think they want to show that everything is relatively calm."
"The situation outside really looks the same as any working day,
although people are clearly shocked," said a Russian diplomat,
confirming that there had been no demonstrations of mass mourning.
The official here spoke as the United States and North Korea announced
a temporary suspension of crucial high-level talks over Pyongyang's
nuclear programme.
Talks that began on Friday and were due to have resumed on Saturday
morning were temporarily called off after the paramount leader's death.
The talks are seen as part of a crucial two-track approach to end the
Korean crisis, wooing the isolated Communist state back into the
international fold and wresting an agreement from Pyongyang to abide by
international rules on nuclear transparency and non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons.
The other track is an unprecedented all-Korean summit set before Kim's
death for July 25-27, the first since the Korean ended in 1953.
Should talks fail, the US will press for sanctions against the country,
a threat North Korea has described as tanatmount to a declaration of
war.
