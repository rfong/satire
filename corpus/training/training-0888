Christmas Storm Arrives in Central Italy 
The Atlantic weather front which battered much of Europe over the
Christmas weekend leaving a trail of death and destruction was Monday
bringing winds of up to 135 km per hour to central Italy.
In the north-central Marche cities of Urbino and Macerata, winds
averaging 60 km per hour, with gusting of up to 135 km per hour,
toppled trees to down high-tension lines, lifted roof-tiles and blew
down billboards and scaffolding.
Power outages were reported in various areas around the region and in
the neighboring Abruzzo region where express highways to and from
L'Aquila, in the Apennines, and Pescara, on the Adriatic coast, were
closed to some types of truck trailers and caravans.
Also in the southern Calabria region, high winds, driving torrential
rains, were causing havoc and forcing the closure of highways blocked
by fallen trees.
In many towns and cities in the region, firefighters were kept busy
coping with wind-borne roof-tiles and gutters and fallen chimneys.
