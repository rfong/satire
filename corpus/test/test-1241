Defense Minister Accepts Resignation of Top General 
Russia's defense minister on Thursday accepted the resignation of a
popular, tough-talking general, apparently clearing the way for a
possible presidential bid in 1996.
President Boris Yeltsin also is likely to endorse the resignation of
Lt. Gen. Alexander Lebed, who last year called him a ``minus.''
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev could not resist a parting shot at
Lebed, with whom he has had a longstanding feud.
``General (Alexander) Lebed is an ordinary general who has served 23
years but has now decided to become some kind of a politician,''
Grachev said while inspecting troops in southern Russia.
As for Lebed's resignation, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Grachev as
saying in the city of Nalchik: ``We don't make a tragedy out of it.''
The outspoken Lebed, 44, resigned earlier this week rather than obey
Grachev's orders to sharply reduce the 14th Army, based in the
breakaway Trans-Dniester region of Moldova.
Grachev's efforts to cut the 14th Army were widely seen as an attempt
to get rid of Lebed, who enjoys broad popularity in the army for his
blunt criticism of incompetence and corruption among the top brass.
Lebed also has accused the army's leadership of bungling the
6-month-old military campaign in Chechnya.
He has sent a letter to Yeltsin warning that cutting his army might
create chaos that could place its arsenal of 50,000 firearms, 805
artillery guns and more than 600 armored vehicles in the wrong hands
and lead to a renewal of hostilities in the region.
Last month, Grachev told him to obey orders or resign and ripped him
for his politically oriented statements. Many expect Lebed to run for
president in 1996.
Lebed returned from Moscow to his troops in Trans-Dniester on Thursday
and told reporters his resignation was a last attempt to call attention
to the danger of ``looting'' the army's weaponry.
