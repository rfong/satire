Ellemann-Jensen "strong" candidate for top NATO job
Denmark's Uffe Ellemann-Jensen is a "very strong" candidate for the
post of NATO secretary general, US Defense Secretary William Perry said
Thursday while acknowledging there were other candidates for the job.
"There are several candidates for the NATO secretary general job,"
Perry told reporters, pointing to Spanish Foreign Minister Javier
Solana. "But Ellemann-Jensen is a very strong candidate for this job."
(In Madrid a spokesman for the foreign ministry said in reaction to
Perry's statement that the Spanish government had not officially
proposed Solana for NATO's top civilian job.
(Questioned by AFP the spokesman would not elaborate.)
Perry said that he hoped the issue would be settled at the next meeting
of NATO foreign ministers on December 4 in Brussels.
Perry met privately with Ellemann-Jensen on Wednesday but both men
refused to comment on the meeting.
Ellemann-Jensen is the only declared candidate but France and Greece
are both opposed to his candidacy.
Spain earlier indicated it would be willing to put Solana's name
forward if there was a clear consensus among the other allies but not
before.
