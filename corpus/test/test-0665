Briton's fate in Cambodia unclear five days after reported rescue 
The fate of a kidnapped British mine clearance expert remained unclear
Monday, five days after his reported rescue.
Christopher Howes, who turned 37 while in Khmer Rouge captivity, was
reported last Thursday to have been rescued by a band of guerrillas
seeking to defect to the government.
A senior army commander told reporters then that Howes was to be turned
over to Cambodian military and British embassy officials Friday and
return to Phnom Penh the same day.
However, neither Howes, of Bristol, nor the defecting guerrillas he is
said to be with have yet appeared at the rendezvous point in the
central province of Kampong Thom, officials said.
Cambodian military and British embassy officials have been unable to
offer any explanation as to why or confirm a variety of reports as to
what has caused the delay.
The absence of solid information about Howes' whereabouts has led to an
increase in speculative press reports on the matter, according to
British officials in Phnom Penh, who say they are worried about the
effect unconfirmed items might have on Howes' family and on efforts to
free him.
Representatives of at least five different national British news
organizations are in Cambodia to cover the story and, to deal with the
interest, the Foreign Office Sunday sent in an information officer to
assist its embassy.
The official, who has experience working with the media in previous
hostage incidents, began work liaising with the press on the Howes case
Monday. He declined to be named, citing Foreign Office procedure.
Howes and his Cambodian assistant, Huon Hourth, were abducted eight
months ago Tuesday while clearing landmines from a roadside pagoda in
Siem Reap, near the 12th-century Angkor Wat temple complex, with about
30 other deminers.
Shortly afterwards, the ex-British serviceman rejected a request to act
as a ransom courier for the other men. The kidnappers then released the
others and moved Howes and Huon Huorth north into Khmer Rouge
territory.
The pair been held near the Khmer Rouge's far-northern base of Anlong
Veng, about nine kilometers (six miles) from the Thai border, but had
recently been sent south to the rebel village Anlong Kranh in Kampong
Thom, where they had been forced to make land mines, according to
military sources.
In Anlong Kranh, Howes and his assistant were reportedly rescued by Dul
Sareuon, a deputy commander of division 519 who wanted to join
colleagues from his unit that had already defected to the government,
one source said.
