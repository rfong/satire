S. Africa, EU Strike Compromise on Trade Deal
The impasse on the labelling of spirits which is holding up the
implementation of the trade agreement between South Africa and the European
Union has been resolved.
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said at a cabinet
meeting in Cape Town on Wednesday that the cabinet had agreed to accept
a compromise with the EU to phase out the use of certain names in
spirit brands.
South Africa would phase out the terms of "grappa" and "ouzo", as well
as "korn", "jagertee" and "pacharan" over five years, he said.
"Our hope is that we can now get down to the real business of the trade
agreement, and that we have now ended this bizarre dispute," Erwin was
quoted by South African Press Association as saying.
Greece and Italy claim that "grappa" and "ouzo" are two popular spirit
brands solely used by Greek and Italian producers. Their objection to
South Africa using the two brands had put on hold the South African-EU
agreement which was originally scheduled to be implemented in January
this year.
Germany and other European countries followed suit, objecting South
Africa using "korn", "jagertee" and "pacharan" to label its spirits.
