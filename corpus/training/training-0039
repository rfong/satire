Sri Lankan Schools Close Indefinitely 
The Sri Lankan government ordered all schools on the island to be
closed today for an indefinite period because of tension between the
government and rebel troops.
Education Ministry sources said that the order was made at the requests
of the parents worried about the security of their children.
The northern Tamil rebels who blew up two oil installations in Colombo
on October 21 have threatened to blow up schools in the south in
retaliation to the government thrust into their stronghold in the
Jaffna peninsula.
With the closure of schools, public examinations scheduled for the year
end are postponed.
