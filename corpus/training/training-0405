Philippine Peso Stays Weak in Early Trade 
The Philippine peso stayed weak against the U.S. dollar early Tuesday
on concerns over the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting and the unresolved
hostage saga in Mindanao.
The peso averaged 44.935 against the previous close of 44.960.
"It's just trading sideways because everybody is still cautious ahead
of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting tonight. There
might be surprises although most people are saying that there will be
no rate increase," said a senior dealer from a local major bank.
Dealers said banks were also waiting for the release of the remaining
25 hostages detained in Jolo, Sulu by bandit group Abu Sayyaf. The
kidnappers reneged on a deal to free them over the weekend.
The peso/dollar pair is seen trading within the 44.90 to 45.00 range
for the rest of Tuesday's session.
