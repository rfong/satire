Bombay Co. Reports Drop In First-quarter Net Income
The Bombay Co. experienced a drop in first-quarter net income, to
$55,000 from $2.2 million for the same period last year, the firm
reported Thursday.
During the three months that ended Oct. 2, the Fort Worth-based
retailer reported sales of $72.3 million, up 23 percent from $58.6
million.
Sales increased 6 percent for stores opened at least one year. The
company said those locations included 62 conversions to large-store
formats during the previous 12 months. Without those stores, Bombay's
sales decreased 3 percent for locations open at least one year.
Analysts had expected Bombay's first quarter to be sluggish, as the
company continues to absorb new retail space from its ongoing store
expansion program.
Robert Nourse, Bombay's president and CEO, attributed the sluggish
performance to lower gross profit and costs associated with the
expansion.
But Nourse said business should improve in the second quarter, when
Bombay's large stores will total almost 200 -- an increase of 95 large
stores over the preceding year. He added that a strong store base and
merchandise assortment should position the company well for the holiday
selling season.
Bombay Co. is a speciality retailer marketing traditionally style
furniture, prints and accessories. It operates 476 Bombay and Alex
&AMP; Ivy stores in the United States and Canada.
