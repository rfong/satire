Reportedly born in 1944 in the Texas town of La Paloma in Cameron County,
Garcia Abrego is said to have gained control of the cartel following the
detention of his uncle Juan Nepomuceco Guerra Cardenas, who founded the
drug organization in the 1970s.
Police say the influence of the Gulf Cartel extends through 23 of
Mexico's 31 states and includes bases in the United States, Colombia
and Central America.
Mexican press accounts have pegged his fortune between three billion
and 15 billion dollars.
Mexican media also linked -- but without proof -- Garcia Abrego to the
March 1994 killing in Tijuana of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential
candidate of the ruling party.
There had been talk since 1995 of a possible deal under which the
cartel chief would surrender to authorities in exchange for guarantees
he would not be deported to the United States and that his family would
not be harmed.
Before Garcia Abrego's arrest, Mexican authorities had arrested several
of his lieutenants, including Carlos Resendez, Raul Valladares del
Angel, the alleged financial head of the group, and his brother
Humberto Garcia Abrego.
