Malaysia's New Government to Table 2000 Budget 
The 2000 budget would be presented in Parliament on December 20, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday.
The is the same budget which was presented on October 29 but not
approved due to Parliament dissolution for new general election,
Mahathir told reporters after announcing his new Cabinet line-up.
Among the proposals of the 2000 budget presented earlier were the one
percentage point reduction in individual income tax and extension of
the exemption period of import duty and sales tax on spares and
consumables on a selective basis to the manufacturing sector to
December 31, 2000.
The personal relief will be increased to 8,000 ringgit (2,105 U. S.
dollars) from 5,000 ringgit (1,315 U.S. dollars) previously. With this,
about 213,000 persons or about 15 percent of taxpayers would not have
to pay income tax.
Under the 2000 budget, a one month's bonus and a 10 percent pay
increase for government employees are granted.
The government also relaxed several conditions relating to the Treasury
Housing Loan Scheme for government employees.
