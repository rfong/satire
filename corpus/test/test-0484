Nigerian President Describes Military Rule In New Book
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo depicts the tragedy of military
rule and gives his reflection upon the country's modern history in a
book published Saturday titled This Animal Called Man.
A bad military administration such as that experienced by the nation
"is worse than a raging, uncontrollable mob and an armed robber", said
the president in the book, written when he was in prison of former
military regime several years ago, reported the Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper Sunday.
Obasanjo particularly lamented the destructive character of the
military in governance and its ethics. The soldier in politics, he
emphasized, " destroys and kills and guards himself with his arms."
Although Obasanjo himself was not present at Saturday's book launch at
the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), he was ably
represented by his daughter, Busola Obasanjo. The book was an
aggregation of the President's thinking while serving a 15-year jail
sentence for trumped-up treason charges initiated by the Late Gen. Sani
Abacha.
If initially on the Nigeria political scene, the military had good and
patriotic intentions, they were quickly supplanted and over-ridden by
sectional loyalties and tendencies and later replaced by diversions of
national resources to their families, relatives, hatchet men and women
and accomplices in crimes and sins, said the president in his new book.
"Whatever good that has been achieved in the political, economic or
social sphere by all past post-independence governments - civilian and
military - have almost been wiped out in the past fifteen years of the
20th century by the two destructive military administrations who, no
matter how much they try to cover up, will have posterity record and
present objective accounts of their misrule and I hope they, their
families and accomplices will be in a position to read such accounts
and records," he continued.
Many dignitaries present on the occasion praised Obasanjo for his
courage and inspiration to put the book together even as a prisoner.
Alhaji Ahmed Joda, former chairman of Peugeot Nigeria Limited who
presided over the public presentation of the book, described Obasanjo
as the best person that can lead Nigeria today.
