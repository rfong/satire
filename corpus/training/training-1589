Isringhausen, 21, is quiet in public and comes across as somewhat shy.
He grew up in southern Illinois, in a town of 2,300 people, and on his
only trip to New York -- to have calcium deposits removed from his arm
by a Mets team physician in 1992 -- he was a bit overwhelmed by a
simple walk through Central Park.
``I'm not going to do that again,'' he said. ``St. Lucie and Binghamton
are plenty big for me. New York would be a change. But Bill would fit
in, probably.''
Like Pulsipher, though, Isringhausen already is allowing himself to
dream of an opportunity in the big leagues. And he is flattered,
clearly, when he is told that the organization considers him a part of
its future nucleus.
``I think a year and a half from now, these guys will all be ready to
pitch at a major league level,'' said Tamargo, echoing the sentiments
of the Mets' executives.
Unless, of course, something untoward happens before then. Pulsipher,
for one, has been known to get into some scrapes. Before his first
spring training, he flipped his truck twice and ended up in the
hospital. A year later, he broke his pitching hand while punching
something he should not have. He swears, though, that he is more mature
now.
``I think right now I'd have to do something kind of outrageous for
them to give up on me,'' Pulsipher said.
And outrageous, with all that is at stake, is most definitely out of
the question. But crazy? Now, that is another matter.
