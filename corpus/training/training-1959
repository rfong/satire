Bookstores Regain Popularity in Coastal Areas (1) 
Liu Yi, working in the Department of Finance of southeast China's
Fujian Province, visits the "Luzhou (Oasis) Bookstore" every week.
"I prefer bookstores to dance halls," said Liu, who graduated from the
People's University of China in Beijing.
Luzhou, together with several other bookstores, is located in an area
near many departments of the provincial government. With fresh flowers
outside the door and a floor space of only 20 sq m, the store houses
books on the social sciences, best-sellers and reference works.
The rapid economic growth and the much-improved living standards of the
people in the coastal areas of the country have become a focus of
public attention during the past decade. As color TV sets, audio-visual
equipment and microwave ovens have been introduced to ordinary
households in these areas, less people visit bookstores and spend less
on books.
Bookstores were then moved out of the downtown area, and dance halls
and restaurants sprang up.
However, the sharp contrast has been seemingly changing recently. The
Xiamen Special Economic Zone, an eastern city in the province which has
experienced rapid economic growth, spent nine million yuan (over one
million US dollars) to make the Xinhua Bookstore's Xiamen branch reopen
in the city's commercial district. Xinhua Bookstore is the largest
chain store selling books in the country.
