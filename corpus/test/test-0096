Indian regional party decides to join government 
An Indian regional party Tuesday joined the country's minority
government, which would pave way for former finance minister
Palaniappan Chidamabram to be back in his finance post.
The Tamil Manila Congress' (TMC) decision was taken by the party chief,
G.K. Moopanar, in the southern city of Madras after the party's
think-tank met late Tuesday.
"The decision was taken in the national interest and in view of the
expectations of the people," Moopanar told reporters.
"The earlier decision to stay away from the coalition was also reversed
by me after considering the part TMC played in the preparation of the
federal budget. The budget needs to be implemented," Moopanar said.
Chidambaram, one of the architects of India's free-market reforms, was
forced to quit his post after TMC leader G.K. Moopanar lost a bitter
leadership battle in the ruling United Front coalition to Gujral and
pulled the party out of the Front.
Gujral, who decided not to hand out the finance portfolio when he named
his cabinet, had urged Moopanar to reverse his decision.
Chidambaram drew up the previous United Front government's Indian
budget for 1997-98 which is to be approved by parliament this week.
Gujral has adopted the same budget.
Business leaders have also pleaded for Chidambaram, regarded as a key
architect of the country's free-market economic reforms, to return to
the helm.
