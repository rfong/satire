Union leader opposed to peace deal arrested in Jordan 
Police arrested a Moslem fundamentalist union leader here on Saturday
who is opposed to Jordan's peace treaty with Israel, officials said.
The arrest of Leith Shubeilat, head of the engineers' union, came after
he attacked King Hussein in a speech at a conference in the northern
town of Irbid last month.
The engineers' union is the largest in Jordan, with 30,000 members.
Most of the unions are opposed to the peace deal with Israel signed in
October 1994.
