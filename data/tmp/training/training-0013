They/PRP Have/VBP n't/RB Won/VBN A/DT Game/NN With/IN Him/PRP Yet/RB ,/, But/CC Bullets/NNP Are/NNP Wild/NNP About/IN Webber/NNP In/IN less/JJR than/IN two/CD weeks/NNS ,/, Chris/NNP Webber/NNP has/VBZ gone/VBN from/IN being/VBG unhappy/JJ and/CC uncertain/JJ about/IN his/PRP$ future/NN to/TO being/VBG perhaps/RB the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ athlete/NN in/IN the/DT nation/NN 's/POS capital/NN ./.

Tuesday/NNP night/NN 's/POS Bullets-Knicks/NNP game/NN marked/VBD the/DT fourth/JJ consecutive/JJ sellout/NN at/IN USAir/NNP Arena/NNP since/IN Webber/NNP was/VBD traded/VBN to/TO the/DT Bullets/NNPS from/IN the/DT Golden/NNP State/NNP Warriors/NNP ./.

It/PRP hardly/RB mattered/VBN that/IN the/DT Bullets/NNPS lost/VBD their/PRP$ first/JJ three/CD games/NNS with/IN Webber/NNP ./.

He/PRP has/VBZ brought/VBN hope/NN ,/, excitement/NN and/CC charisma/NN to/TO a/DT young/JJ ,/, rebuilding/JJ team/NN ./.

According/VBG to/TO Webber/NNP ,/, the/DT good/JJ times/NNS have/VBP just/RB begun/VBN ./.

``/`` We/PRP 're/VBP a/DT better/JJR team/NN now/RB than/IN before/IN we/PRP made/VBD the/DT trade/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Webber/NNP ,/, discussing/VBG the/DT blockbuster/JJ deal/NN that/WDT sent/VBD him/PRP to/TO the/DT Bullets/NNPS in/IN exchange/NN for/IN Tom/NNP Gugliotta/NNP and/CC three/CD first-round/JJ draft/NN picks/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PRP 'm/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO think/VB like/IN that/DT ./.

That/DT 's/VBZ not/RB cocky/JJ or/CC meant/VBD as/IN any/DT disrespect/NN to/TO Tom/NNP Gugliotta/NNP ./.

I/PRP respect/VB him/PRP as/IN a/DT player/NN and/CC as/IN a/DT person/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP have/VBP confidence/NN in/IN myself/PRP ./. ''/''

Why/WRB not/RB ?/.

Webber/NNP ,/, a/DT 6-foot-10-inch/JJ power/NN forward/RB ,/, was/VBD the/DT NBA/NNP 's/POS Rookie/NNP of/IN the/DT Year/NN last/JJ season/NN ./.

And/CC no/DT one/NN questions/VBZ the/DT 21-year-old/NN 's/POS multidimensional/JJ skills/NNS as/IN a/DT rebounder/NN ,/, shot-blocker/NN ,/, intimidator/NN and/CC scorer/NN ./.

Jim/NNP Lynam/NNP ,/, the/DT Bullets/NNPS '/POS coach/NN ,/, had/VBD the/DT pleasure/NN of/IN coaching/NNP Charles/NNP Barkley/NNP with/IN the/DT Philadelphia/NNP 76ers/NN ,/, and/CC Lynam/NNP sees/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN Barkley/NNP in/IN Webber/NNP ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT fair/JJ comparison/NN --/: I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mean/VB skill/NN for/IN skill/NN ,/, but/CC as/RB an/DT extraordinary/JJ athlete/NN at/IN the/DT position/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Lynam/NNP ./.

And/CC by/IN joining/VBG the/DT Bullets/NNPS ,/, Webber/NNP left/VBD behind/IN his/PRP$ strained/JJ relationship/NN with/IN Don/NNP Nelson/NNP ,/, the/DT Warriors/NNPS '/POS coach/NN and/CC general/JJ manager/NN ./.

Webber/NNP no/RB longer/RB wanted/VBD to/TO play/VB for/IN Nelson/NNP ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ differences/NNS forced/VBD the/DT Warriors/NNPS to/TO make/VB the/DT deal/NN ./.

Webber/NNP was/VBD portrayed/VBN by/IN many/JJ as/IN being/VBG spoiled/VBD and/CC selfish/VBG for/IN challenging/VBG one/CD of/IN the/DT league/NN 's/POS most-respected/JJS coaches/NNS and/CC for/IN leaving/VBG a/DT contending/JJ team/NN ./.

But/CC Webber/NNP said/VBD today/NN that/IN the/DT criticism/NN was/VBD worth/IN the/DT gain/NN ./.

And/CC he/PRP continued/VBD to/TO avoid/VB discussing/VBG the/DT specifics/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ rift/NN with/IN Nelson/NNP ./.

``/`` It/PRP would/MD n't/RB do/VB anything/NN but/CC just/RB raise/VB discussions/NNS and/CC have/VB people/NNS write/VB articles/NNS ,/, ''/'' Webber/NNP said/VBD of/IN his/PRP$ refusal/NN to/TO reveal/VB why/WRB he/PRP and/CC Nelson/NNP could/MD not/RB resolve/VB their/PRP$ differences/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB trying/VBG to/TO blast/VB that/DT man/NN ./.

He/PRP does/VBZ what/WP he/PRP does/VBZ ,/, he/PRP did/VBD what/WP he/PRP did/VBD ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ over/IN with/IN ./.

I/PRP can/MD sleep/VB good/JJ at/IN night/NN ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP happy/JJ now/RB ./.

I/PRP could/MD n't/RB sleep/VB during/IN the/DT summer/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT has/VBZ never/RB happened/VBN before/RB ./.

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB need/VB to/TO bash/VB him/PRP ./.

The/DT truth/NN comes/VBZ out/RP ./.

I/PRP know/VBP I/PRP still/RB have/VBP the/DT support/NN of/IN people/NNS in/IN that/DT organization/NN ./.

A/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT teammates/NNS call/VBP me/PRP every/DT day/NN ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB trying/VBG to/TO judge/VB anybody/NN ./.

I/PRP just/RB had/VBD a/DT problem/NN with/IN him/PRP ./.

He/PRP would/MD n't/RB talk/VB to/TO me/PRP ,/, I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO leave/VB ./. ''/''

Webber/NNP ,/, a/DT Detroit/NNP native/NN who/WP can/MD be/VB a/DT restricted/JJ free/JJ agent/NN after/IN the/DT season/NN ,/, said/VBD that/IN he/PRP hopes/VBZ to/TO remain/VB with/IN the/DT Bullets/NNPS instead/RB of/IN pursuing/VBG a/DT contract/NN with/IN the/DT Pistons/NNPS ./.

Joining/VBG the/DT Bullets/NNPS has/VBZ reunited/VBN Webber/NNP with/IN Juwan/NNP Howard/NNP ,/, the/DT rookie/NN forward/RB who/WP played/VBD with/IN Webber/NNP at/IN Michigan/NNP ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, Lynam/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN happy/JJ with/IN Webber/NNP ,/, even/RB though/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN Webber/NNP and/CC Howard/NNP has/VBZ altered/VBN the/DT Bullets/NNPS '/POS chemistry/NN ./.

Washington/NNP was/VBD 4-1/CD before/IN the/DT trade/NN was/VBD made/VBN ./.

``/`` The/DT people/NNS here/RB are/VBP very/RB excited/JJ ,/, and/CC rightfully/RB so/RB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Lynam/NNP while/IN discussing/VBG the/DT team/NN 's/POS outlook/NN ./.

``/`` You/PRP do/VBP the/DT best/JJS you/PRP can/MD ./.

I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB put/VB a/DT timetable/NN on/IN it/PRP ./.

Literally/RB ,/, your/PRP$ guess/NN would/MD be/VB as/RB good/JJ as/IN mine/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT guy/NN that/WDT buys/VBZ the/DT tickets/NNS could/MD guess/VB as/RB to/TO when/WRB we/PRP 'll/MD gel/VB ./.

But/CC we/PRP have/VBP more/JJR talent/NN now/RB than/IN when/WRB we/PRP started/VBD the/DT season/NN ./. ''/''

Now/RB Webber/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO repay/VB the/DT new/JJ fan/NN support/NN with/IN a/DT few/JJ victories/NNS ./.

s./NN ``/`` A/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS are/VBP saying/VBG ,/, `/`` I/PRP told/VBD you/PRP so/RB '/'' ,/, because/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP here/RB and/CC we/PRP 're/VBP losing/VBG ,/, ''/'' Webber/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` That/DT 's/VBZ fine/JJ ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT loser/NN ./.

I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB lost/VBN with/IN any/DT team/NN ./.

We/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG to/TO win/VB in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB happy/JJ that/IN we/PRP 're/VBP losing/VBG ,/, but/CC I/PRP know/VBP we/PRP 're/VBP paying/VBG our/PRP$ dues/NNS and/CC I/PRP know/VBP our/PRP$ day/NN is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO come/VB ./.

And/CC that/DT 's/VBZ going/VBG t/NN make/VB it/PRP much/RB sweeter/JJ ./. ''/''
