North Korean Premier Kang still holds position 
North Korean Premier Kang Song-San appeared in public this weekend,
belying an earlier speculation that he might have been ousted following
the reported defection of his son-in-law, a radio report said Sunday.
Kang was among those at a Pyongyang meeting Saturday to commemorate the
20th anniversary of the publication of a "historical work" by Kim
Jong-Il, heir-apparent to late North Korean president Kim Il-Sung, the
Pyongyang radio report, monitored here, said.
It was the first time in 20 days that Kang had appeared in public,
North Korean watchers said.
South Korea's Weekly Chosun newspaper said Wednesday that Kang lost his
position in mid-August because of his son-in-law Kang Myong-Do's
defection to South Korea in May.
Kang Myong-Do told reporters in Seoul in late July that he was the
North Korean premier's son-in-law, but North Korea denied his claim.
