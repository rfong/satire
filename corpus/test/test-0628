Coatal Province Gets 15 Million Yuan In Back Taxes 
An increasing effort to fight tax evasion by overseas-funded
enterprises in Fuzhou, the capital of east China's Fujian province, has
helped the taxation bureau get more than 15 million yuan in overdue
taxes.
Tax collectors audited more than 300 overseas-funded ventures to
examine tax payments, local taxation officials say. This was first done
in 1991, because of increased deficits in local overseas-funded
ventures and an increase in overseas investment, meaning that some
enterprises were evading taxes by fabricating false corporate reports.
There are more than 3,600 overseas-funded enterprises in the city,
whose taxes amount to 870 million yuan. The local taxation
administration has computerized the whole process to deal with the
problem using software it developed.
