Massive coral rescue project fails in Singapore 
A mammoth programme to relocate hundreds of coral colonies in Singapore
to facilitate a reclamation project has ended in failure due to strong
waves caused by ships, a report said Tuesday.
About two-thirds of the corals moved to a site off Sentosa tourist
resort in what is possibly the world's largest coral rescue project are
dying or have already died, the Straits Times reported.
The corals had been moved about two years ago from Pulau Air Chawan,
among seven islets off the main island of Singapore being merged for a
giant petrochemical complex.
The corals' survival rate was as low as 15 percent in a three
square-metre (32.3-square feet) plot monitored closely for more than a
year by a team of marine biologists from the National University of
Singapore, the report said.
Waves created by passing ferries were the main cause for the failure.
The waves toppled or swept away the corals, many of which were not
anchored to the sea floor.
The waves also churned up sediment which settled on the corals, killing
them over time.
The massive two-year coral rescue project, which involved collecting
corals by hand from Pulau Ayer Chawan reef and moving them to the new
site off Sentosa, was coordinated by the marine conservation group of
the Nature Society (Singapore).
In the course of each trip, divers, together with several snorkellers
and other helpers -- all volunteers -- went out in boats to collect and
transfer the corals between 1993 and 1995.
In all, about 450 volunteers spent some 10,000 hours underwater moving
the corals.
Chou Loke Ming, who led the National University of Singapore monitoring
team, said that coral translocation was still a suitable strategy when
there was no management option left to save reefs, as in this case.
