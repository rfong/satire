Indonesian Assembly Ready for Snap Special Session
"The convening of the special session is only a matter of hours, no
longer days, away," MPR Chairman Amien Rais said after attending a
meeting of Assembly leaders and faction leaders of the Assembly and the
House of Representatives (DPR).
"So I warn Assembly members to be alert during the coming days . ..
please don't fall asleep," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as
saying.
All Assembly members were instructed to make immediate preparations to
come to the capital. Those who were already here were barred from
leaving town.
Assembly Faction chiefs were also instructed to contact their members
as part of these preparations.
The sudden acceleration of activity was spurred on Thursday afternoon
by news that President Abdurrahman Wahid had instructed the arrest of
National Police chief Gen. Surojo Bimantoro, whom the president had
dismissed.
The Assembly is set to convene a special session on August 1 to seek
the president's accountability, if the accountability is rejected,
Wahid could be removed from office.
Wahid has thus far been defiant and warned that he would impose a state
of emergency and dissolve the legislature if they seek his
accountability.
Rais has also warned that if the president imposes a state of emergency
the Assembly could convene a special session within a matter of days.
