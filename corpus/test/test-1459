Nepal to Develop Economy Through Industry Promotion 
Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said Wednesday that his
government had decided to develop the country's economy through the
promotion of industry and business.
Speaking at a meeting with local industrialists and businessmen at his
residence here Wednesday evening, Deuba said industry and business had
a important role to play in sustainable economic development in Nepal.
He reiterated his government's commitment to sustainable economic
development in the country.
With a view to facilitating indigenous and foreign investment in the
trade and industry sectors, the government had made timely amendment to
some relevant laws, Deuba said, adding that new bills would be
introduced in the next parliament session for creating a better
investment climate.
Stating that the treaty signed between Nepal and India earlier this
week would facilitate the entry of Nepalese products into the Indian
market, Deuba said during his forthcoming visit to India he would hold
further talks with the Indian government on the promotion of Nepal's
exports to India.
The Nepali Prime Minister was scheduled to visit India later this
month. It would be his first official foreign visit after he became
prime minister of the present coalition government last September.
