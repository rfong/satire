Hopes fade for imminent reconciliation in divided Madagascar
Hopes for imminent reconciliation in politically riven Madagascar
diminished Friday, when a newly installed prime minister announced he would
initially exclude opponents from his government and as reports of more
violence reached the capital.
Jacques Sylla, who was Thursday named prime minister by the newly and
controversially sworn-in president, Marc Ravalomanana, announced Friday
that his government would not, for the time being, include supporters
of former president Didier Ratsiraka.
The government will be opened up only at a later stage, said Sylla,
without giving a time frame.
Ratsiraka does not recognise Ravalomanana as president and maintains he
is still head of state, while some of his supporters in the provinces
have gone to the extreme of declaring independence.
On Thursday afternoon, five of Ravalomanana's supporters were wounded
in Mahajanga, in the northwest, by "militants" recruited and paid by
Ratsiraka's supporters.
"I am going to form a government which will still be a constrained
government during an initial stage, but in a subsequent stage, we will
have a much bigger government," Sylla said.
Sylla said he would name members of the government over the weekend or
early next week.
He said the second phase would get under way when events and the
"political context" were appropriate.
Shortly before he was officially sworn in on Monday, Ravalomanana had
promised a government "that would reconcile the people of Madagascar"
who have been in the throes of a crisis ever since Ravalomanana
unilaterally declared himself the winner of the December 16 election.
Sylla, who had already served as the head of an earlier, unofficial
government Ravalomanana set up in February, was reappointed after a
fierce internal battle.
The struggle seems to have ended with the defeat of moderates in
Ravalomanana's camp, those in favour of bringing in opposition
heavyweights into the government.
"Reconciliation would have been easier with a neutral or moderate
person from Ravalomanana's camp," commented one diplomat.
Sylla said he would not exclude any approaches from officials in
Ratsiraka's camp wanting to join the government, with the exception of
hardliners.
Meanwhile, Ratsiraka's supporters maintained a stringent blockade on
the capital and highlands through the use of roadbocks and by blowing
up bridges.
And there was no sign of pro-Ratsiraka governors going back on their
declarations of the independence of their provinces.
In Mahajanga, Ratsiraka supporters looted and torched shops and houses
in a district populated by Merinas, the ethnic group that predominates
in the highlands, from where Ravalomanana himself originates.
Five young Ravalomanana supporters were wounded, two of them seriously.
"In Mahajanga we will see the start of a wider confrontation if no
political solution is found, especially now that the political clashes
are taking on a clear ethnic dimension," warned one Western observer.
