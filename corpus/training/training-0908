Suspects Involved In Taiwanese Woman's Death Arrested 
Four men suspected of being involved in the death of Lin Ti-chuan, a
Taiwanese woman who was killed during a recent business trip to the
mainland, have been arrested, China's Public Security Ministry said
here today.
One of the four, Huang Shidong, was apprehended in Mulan County in
northernmost Heilongjiang Province at 3 p.m. on Tuesday. A second,
Zhang Shifeng, was apprehended at about 11 a.m. yesterday morning on a
train going from Yantai in east China's Shandong Province to Shanghai.
Yang Rongxi, the third, was caught at about 4 p.m. yesterday in the
port city of Dalian in northeastern Liaoning Province. The fourth, Zhao
Chuang turned himself in to the public security department in the city
of Haicheng in Liaoning at about 5 p.m. yesterday.
According to a preliminary investigation and interrogation, Lin's
kidnapping was plotted by Li Guangzhi, a businessman from Dalian, who
was attempting to force his Taiwanese business partner Wei Tien-kang to
pay some money Wei owed him. Li invited both Wei and Lin, who was
accompanying Wei, to Dalian and, upon their arrival on the evening of
July 27 they were abducted by the four men and taken to an empty room
in the Haicheng Development Zone.
Yang Rongxi gave Wei and Lin several injections to knock them out, but
Lin began to suffer respiratory difficulties and turned pale around 11
a.m. on July 29. Huang then sent her to the Haicheng Central Hospital.
When he discovered that Lin had died, he fled. His accomplices also
fled.
At present, the police have started a dragnet to find Li Guangzhi and
are continuing their thorough investigation.
