Japanese pitcher finds second start tougher 
Japanese pitcher Hideo Nomo, the first US major league baseball player
from his homeland in 30 years, struck out seven but struggled to no
decision here Sunday in his second start.
Nomo surrendered seven runs on nine hits, three of them home runs, in
four and two-thirds innings of work, but the Los Angeles Dodgers
rallied for a 12-10 National League victory over the Colorado Rockies.
Nomo pitched five scoreless innings and allowed only one hit in his US
opener last Tuesday against San Francisco.
"Nomo's control was not good," Dodgers' manager Tommy Lasorda said. "He
just didn't throw as well as he did in San Francisco. Maybe it was the
altitude."
Denver is 1.6 kilometers above sea level.
Bill Swift, Dante Bichette and Larry Walker all homered off Nomo for
the Rockies. Walker and Bischette each smacked solo homers in the fifth
inning, prompting Lasorda to replace Nomo.
"Those were just missed pitches," Nomo said.
Omar Daal wound up taking the victory for Los Angeles, which had a
career-high six runs from catcher Mike Piazza to rally the Dodgers.
Piazza had a grand slam in the third inning and a solo homer in the
eighth to give the Dodgers the lead for good.
The results left both clubs 7-4 in the NL West division.
