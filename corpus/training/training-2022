China Builds World Biggest Transfer Factor Production Base
A transnational enterprise group based in Xi'an has established what is
thought to be the world's largest production base for transfer factor,
a drug used for the prevention and treatment of Hepatitis B.
The high-tech biological pharmaceutical can adjust and strengthen
immunologic functions and can be used to treat other diseases caused by
viruses.
The Xi'an Jinhua Group, which has engaged in the research into and
development of transfer factors for many years, invested over 200
million yuan (24 million U.S. dollars) in establishing the production
base.
The base is located in a high-tech development zone in Xi'an, capital
of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
Transfer factor is a biological compound normally extracted from the
spleens of animals.
The production base will have an annual production capacity of 100
million units of oral liquid and 100 million capsules of transfer
factor, as well as 100 million tablets of interferon.
