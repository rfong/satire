Putin Travels: Annexing the North Pole
By Vladimir Putin
My six day arctic flag-planting journey was an odyssey for the ages.
Read my diary.
Day 1:
I handpick a crew from the Russian military and assign a few of my
former KGB comrades to join me on a trip to claim Arctic land as
Russian territory. Chief among the men is Boris Akelskov, who will be
my trusted sidekick on this perilous journey. He promises me his
undying allegiance and pledges that he will never leave my side during
this trip. This proves true on the first day as he follows me into the
bathroom on several occasions.
Day 2:
We encounter blocks of ice, and I am informed that our ship cannot pass
through. I go out and begin punching the ice with KGB hammer fists.
Sure enough, Boris is right beside me. I grow tired, as this enormous
task proves too difficult. I tell the men to incite my anger. They
refuse at first, but I tell them that they should not fear me. Inciting
my anger is the only way!
