Chase Manhattan gets approval to open Shanghai branch 
Chase Manhattan Bank has received approval to upgrade its
representative office in Shanghai to a full branch, the US bank said in
a statement Monday.
The branch would open for business early next year in Shanghai, Peter
Shay, the chief representative who will become branch manager, said.
The office would move over to the new Shanghai financial centre of
Pudong, east of Huangpu river in 1998, he added.
Chase Manhattan Bank has another branch in the northern port city of
Tianjin.
