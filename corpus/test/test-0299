China says British "Dying Rooms" documentary a fake 
China alleged Thursday that a recent British television documentary
which said millions of baby girls are abandoned, often to die, in state
orphanages was a "mean-spirited" fake.
Xinhua news agency quoted an official as saying footage of the
orphanages' "Dying Rooms," where a Channel Four documentary said many
girls were left to die, was in fact shot in a storeroom of a welfare
house in Huangshi city in central Hubei province.
"It was a distortion of facts to portray the storeroom as a 'dying
room' and to claim that the beds that were vacant after their previous
occupants had been adopted were the empty beds of children who had
died," Xinhua said, accusing a "foreign gentleman" of setting up the
scene with certain "materials."
The programme, said by its makers to have been filmed with hidden
cameras at orphanages in five provinces, depicted babies and toddlers
tied in rows to bamboo seats, legs splayed over makeshift potties, left
rocking to and fro with no human care or stimulation.
Diseases were left untreated, the narrator said, adding that children
that became too ill were placed in the "dying rooms" to wither away.
The footage and the allegations that some one million baby girls,
abandoned annually as a result of China's "one child" family planning
policy, ended up in such orphanages caused an outcry in western
countries after its mid-June broadcast.
The Chinese official appeared to accuse the documentary-makers,
identified as Kate Blewett and "companions," of causing the death of
one child, who was said in the programme to have succumbed to lack of
basic daily care and medical treatment.
He said that scene was shot in the Duanzhou district welfare house in
Zhaoqing city in southern Guangdong province, adding that the
documentary incorrectly identified the seriously sick boy as a girl.
Xinhua quoted a nurse, Yang Jinying, as saying the boy received
emergency treatment in the welfare home's hospital on February 20,
after Blewett "removed the cotton-padded quilt and opened the boy's
clothes" in spite of her efforts to dissuade them.
The crew left the child lying in the cold winter weather without
clothing for 15 or 20 minutes while the scene was arranged for the
cameramen, the report said, adding that he had later died after efforts
to save him failed.
It questioned how Blewett could substantiate allegations that 80
children died in the Huangshi centre last year given that records
indicated that, in 1994, 128 of its 161 occupants had been adopted.
