`Dream Team' Deal: 
The entertainment dream team of Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg
and David Geffen is forming a TV studio in a deal with ABC.
It is the first solid venture announced by the high-powered trio, which
joined money and minds last month to make movies and other
entertainment. The new studio will create shows for all four networks,
cable channels and syndicated programming.
Monday's ABC deal hit the same day as rumors that Spielberg, former
Disney honcho Katzenberg and record billionaire Geffen were trying to
woo Matt Williams and Wind Dancer -- home of TV's No. 1 show ``Home
Improvement'' -- to join the trio. According to The Hollywood Reporter,
Disney chief Michael Eisner went ``apoplectic'' at the news. Williams'
deal with Disney is up in a year.
Hollywood's newest team has no lock on success in TV. Spielberg's
record is middling. His Amblin Entertainment produces two lukewarm NBC
series: ``seaQuest DSV'' and ``Earth 2.'' His recent animated comedy
``Family Dog'' bombed. But he has ratings winners with kids: ``Tiny
Toons'' and ``Animaniacs.''
