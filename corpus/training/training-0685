China Reinforces Typhoon Preparedness (1) 
China has intensified efforts to prepare for the approaching typhoon
season, according to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters.
The extensive effort has centered on reinforcing embankments and dikes
and establishing dense windbreaks in coastal areas.
China is highly vulnerable to typhoons due to unique geographic
conditions and extensive coastline stretching over 19,000 kilometers,
according to officials with the China Meteorological Administration.
They noted that the country is especially vulnerable to tropical
cyclones spawned in the northwest Pacific Ocean and the South China
Sea.
An average seven to eight typhoons hit 11 coastal provinces annually,
with tropical cyclones affecting as many as 25 provinces.
Official statistics show that typhoons destroyed 4.67 million ha. of
crops and heavily damaged more than 400,000 houses between 1990-1997,
with direct losses averaging some 20 billion yuan annually. The fact
that only three typhoons hit the country in 1998 led to a sharp drop in
losses.
China has placed great emphasis on strengthening typhoon preparedness
in coastal areas, with related efforts including the construction of
sea walls and embankments stretching 13,500 kilometers. Related
fortifications stretching some 5,965 km, or 1. 23-fold more than in
1993, fulfill the highest state standards.
Jiangsu Province plans to invest 1.8 billion yuan (217 million US
dollars) this year to standardize local river and sea walls. All sea
walls in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region fulfill state
standards.
