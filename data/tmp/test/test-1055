Roundup/NN :/: Africa/NNP to/TO Strengthen/NNP Capacity/NNP Building/NNP for/IN Sustainable/NNP Development/NNP African/NNP countries/NNS have/VBP determined/VBN to/TO further/RBR strengthen/VB capacity/NN building/NN for/IN sustainable/JJ development/NN in/IN the/DT continent/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT just-ended/JJ ``/`` Regional/NNP Workshop/NNP for/IN National/NNP Focal/NNP Points/NNP on/IN Capacity-Building/NNP Coordination/NNP in/IN Africa/NNP ''/'' held/VBN in/IN Lusaka/NNP ,/, participants/NNS from/IN 14/CD African/JJ countries/NNS noted/VBD that/IN a/DT country/NN can/MD not/RB hope/VB to/TO make/VB much/JJ progress/NN toward/IN sustainable/JJ development/NN and/CC poverty/NN reduction/NN unless/IN it/PRP has/VBZ the/DT requisite/JJ human/JJ and/CC institutional/JJ capacity/NN to/TO effectively/RB design/VB ,/, implement/VB and/CC manage/VB its/PRP$ development/NN policies/NNS and/CC programs/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ consensus/NN among/IN African/JJ leaders/NNS ,/, leading/JJ scholars/NNS ,/, academics/NNS and/CC donors/NNS that/IN capacity/NN building/NN is/VBZ Africa/NNP 's/POS most/JJS urgent/JJ challenge/NN and/CC the/DT cornerstone/NN of/IN its/PRP$ development/NN strategy/NN ./.

Capacity/JJ building/NN entails/VBZ both/DT human/JJ skills/NNS enhancement/NN and/CC institution/NN strengthening/NN ./.

According/VBG to/TO a/DT report/NN presented/VBN to/TO the/DT workshop/NN ,/, the/DT linkage/JJ between/IN capacity/NN building/NN and/CC sustainable/JJ development/NN has/VBZ been/VBN amply/RB illustrated/VBN by/IN the/DT outstanding/JJ records/NNS of/IN the/DT fast/JJ growing/VBG Southeast/NNP Asian/NNP countries/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT early/JJ 1960s/NNS ,/, several/JJ of/IN these/DT countries/NNS had/VBD the/DT same/JJ per/IN capita/NN incomes/NNS as/IN some/DT Africa/NNP countries/NNS but/CC these/DT countries/NNS are/VBP now/RB much/RB more/JJR developed/VBD with/IN per/IN capita/NN incomes/NNS 25/CD times/NNS those/DT of/IN African/JJ countries/NNS ./.

These/DT countries/NNS lack/VBP natural/JJ resources/NNS and/CC also/RB faced/VBD discrimination/NN against/IN their/PRP$ exports/NNS to/TO the/DT West/NNP ./.

These/DT countries/NNS invested/VBD heavily/RB in/IN all/DT levels/NNS of/IN education/NN and/CC other/JJ social/JJ services/NNS ./.

They/PRP also/RB determinedly/RB shared/VBD the/DT fruits/NNS of/IN growth/NN ,/, thus/RB reducing/VBG inequality/NN ./.

Also/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT 1960s/NNS to/TO 1970s/CD ,/, most/RBS African/JJ countries/NNS invested/VBD heavily/RB in/IN all/DT levels/NNS of/IN education/NN ,/, health/NN and/CC physical/JJ infrastructure/NN ./.

Some/DT African/JJ universities/NNS were/VBD renowned/VBN the/DT world/NN over/RB ,/, as/IN centers/NNS of/IN excellence/NN in/IN both/DT teaching/NN and/CC research/NN ./.

As/IN the/DT 21st/JJ century/NN begins/VBZ ,/, Africa/NNP is/VBZ lagging/VBG behind/RP of/IN other/JJ regions/NNS in/IN socio-economic/JJ development/NN ./.

Africa/NNP has/VBZ many/JJ of/IN the/DT world/NN 's/POS poorest/JJS countries/NNS ,/, with/IN per/IN capita/NN income/NN lower/JJR than/IN before/IN independence/NN ./.

About/RB 50/CD percent/NN of/IN Africa/NNP 's/POS people/NNS are/VBP classified/VBN as/IN poor/JJ and/CC 30/CD percent/NN as/IN extremely/RB poor/JJ ,/, the/DT report/NN said/VBD ./.

Both/CC the/DT universities/NNS and/CC the/DT civil/JJ service/NN continue/VBP to/TO suffer/VB from/IN massive/JJ brain/NN drain/NN ,/, estimated/VBN at/IN 23,000/CD per/IN year/NN ./.

The/DT situation/NN is/VBZ a/DT result/NN of/IN both/DT internal/JJ and/CC external/JJ factors/NNS ./.

These/DT factors/NNS have/VBP reduced/VBN the/DT capacity/NN of/IN African/JJ countries/NNS to/TO invest/VB sufficiently/JJ and/CC sustainable/JJ in/IN human/JJ and/CC institutional/JJ capacity/NN building/NN ./.

The/DT capacity/NN of/IN many/JJ countries/NNS is/VBZ being/VBG further/RBR eroded/VBN by/IN armed/JJ conflicts/NNS which/WDT according/VBG to/TO the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS High/NNP Commissioner/NNP for/IN Refugees/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- UNHCR/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, claimed/VBD two/CD million/CD lives/NNS in/IN the/DT last/JJ five/CD years/NNS ./.
