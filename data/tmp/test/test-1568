Croatia/NNP Indicts/NNP Suspected/NNP Prison/NNP Camp/NNP Commander/NNP A/NNP Serb/NNP accused/VBN of/IN being/VBG a/DT commander/NN of/IN a/DT brutal/JJ prison/NN camp/NN has/VBZ been/VBN arrested/VBN and/CC indicted/VBN on/IN charges/NNS of/IN murder/NN ,/, torture/NNS and/CC crimes/NNS against/IN humanity/NN ./.

Mirko/NNP Grahorac/NNP was/VBD arrested/VBN in/IN Croatia/NNP 's/POS Adriatic/JJ port/NN of/IN Split/NNP in/IN in/IN early/RB March/NNP after/IN he/PRP was/VBD recognized/VBN on/IN the/DT street/NN by/IN at/IN least/JJS three/CD former/JJ inmates/NNS of/IN the/DT Manjaca/NNP prison/NN camp/NN in/IN northern/JJ Bosnia/NNP ,/, the/DT Zagreb/NNP daily/JJ Vecernji/NN List/NN reported/VBD Wednesday/NNP ./.

The/DT arrest/NN had/VBD not/RB been/VBN previously/RB announced/VBN ./.

The/DT public/JJ prosecutor/NN 's/POS office/NN in/IN Split/NNP told/VBD The/DT Associated/NNP Press/NNP that/IN Grahorac/NNP ,/, 53/CD ,/, was/VBD indicted/VBN Tuesday/NNP ./.

He/PRP is/VBZ awaiting/VBG trial/NN at/IN Split/NNP criminal/JJ court/NN ,/, said/VBD Slavko/NNP Mrsic/NNP ,/, a/DT deputy/JJ public/JJ prosecutor/NN ./.

If/IN convicted/VBN ,/, Grahorac/NNP faces/VBZ a/DT maximum/JJ sentence/NN of/IN life/NN in/IN prison/NN ./.

Grahorac/NNP is/VBZ accused/VBN of/IN beating/VBG ,/, torturing/VBG and/CC killing/VBG Muslim/NNP and/CC Croat/NNP prisoners/NNS in/IN the/DT Manjaca/NNP prison/NN camp/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN three/CD camps/NNS in/IN northern/JJ Bosnia/NNP where/WRB Serbs/NNP allegedly/RB carried/VBD out/RP atrocities/NNS against/IN non-Serbs/NNS in/IN the/DT summer/NN of/IN 1992/CD ./.

Grahorac/NNP has/VBZ denied/VBN the/DT charges/NNS ,/, Mrsic/NNP said/VBD ./.

The/DT newspaper/NN paper/NN said/VBD Grahorac/NNP had/VBD returned/VBN to/TO Split/NNP ,/, where/WRB he/PRP had/VBD worked/VBN as/IN a/DT police/NN officer/NN before/IN war/NN broke/VBD out/RP ,/, after/IN the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNP closed/VBD the/DT Manjaca/NNP camp/NN in/IN late/RB 1992/CD following/VBG an/DT international/JJ outcry/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD unclear/JJ why/WRB Grahorac/NNP ,/, a/DT Serb/NN born/VBN near/IN Manjaca/NNP ,/, would/MD return/VB to/TO Split/NNP ,/, where/WRB ex-Croat/NN or/CC Muslim/NN prisoners/NNS from/IN Manjaca/NNP were/VBD likely/JJ to/TO recognize/VB him/PRP ./.

The/DT newspaper/NN ,/, quoting/VBG prosecutors/NNS ,/, said/VBD Grahorac/NNP had/VBD been/VBN in/IN charge/NN of/IN security/NN in/IN Manjaca/NNP ./.

The/DT three/CD witnesses/NNS who/WP claimed/VBD they/PRP recognized/VBD Grahorac/NNP said/VBD the/DT suspect/NN would/MD beat/VB them/PRP with/IN rifle/JJ butts/NNS and/CC electric/JJ cables/NNS ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT witnesses/NNS claimed/VBD he/PRP was/VBD tortured/JJ by/IN Grahorac/NNP ,/, the/DT prosecutor/NN Mrsic/NNP said/VBD ./.

Another/DT witness/NN said/VBD two/CD of/IN his/PRP$ fellow/JJ inmates/NNS ,/, both/DT Muslims/NNPS ,/, had/VBD died/VBN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN Grahorac/NNP 's/POS repeated/VBN and/CC violent/JJ beatings/NNS ./.

The/DT indictment/NN said/VBD Grahorac/NNP and/CC Serb/NNP guards/NNS used/VBD knives/NNS to/TO kill/VB seven/CD prisoners/NNS who/WP had/VBD just/RB been/VBN transferred/VBN to/TO Majaca/NNP in/IN September/NNP 1992/CD ,/, Mrsic/NNP said/VBD ./.

Although/IN Bosnians/NNP ,/, Croatians/NNP and/CC Serbs/NNP are/VBP all/RB said/VBN to/TO have/VB committed/VBN atrocities/NNS in/IN Bosnia/NNP ,/, international/JJ organizations/NNS and/CC monitoring/NN groups/NNS hold/VBP the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNP responsible/JJ for/IN the/DT bulk/NN of/IN them/PRP ./.

The/DT Yugoslav/NNP War/NNP Crimes/NNP Tribunal/NNP in/IN The/DT Hague/NNP has/VBZ already/RB named/VBN the/DT Bosnian/NNP Serb/NNP leader/NN Radovan/NNP Karadzic/NNP and/CC other/JJ senior/JJ Bosnian/NNP Serbs/NNS as/IN possible/JJ war/NN crimes/NNS suspects/VBZ ./.

So/IN far/RB the/DT tribunal/NN has/VBZ indicted/VBN 22/CD Serbs/NNS on/IN charges/NNS including/VBG genocide/NN ,/, murder/NN ,/, torture/NN and/CC rape/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ not/RB indicted/VBN Grahorac/NNP ./.

The/DT only/JJ war/NN crimes/NNS suspect/VBP in/IN custody/NN of/IN the/DT tribunal/NN ,/, Dusan/NNP Tadic/NNP ,/, was/VBD arrested/VBN in/IN Germany/NNP also/RB after/IN being/VBG spotted/VBN by/IN Bosnian/NNP refugees/NNS ,/, former/JJ camp/NN detainees/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ yet/RB unclear/JJ if/IN Croatian/NNP authorities/NNS will/MD hand/VB over/RP Grahorac/NNP 's/POS case/NN to/TO the/DT tribunal/NN ./.

The/DT tribunal/NN would/MD be/VB unable/JJ to/TO prosecute/VB Grahorac/NNP if/IN Croatia/NNP tries/VBZ him/PRP ,/, because/IN suspects/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB tried/VBN twice/RB for/IN the/DT same/JJ offenses/NNS ./.

Croatia/NNP 's/POS criminal/JJ code/NN entitles/VBZ it/PRP to/TO try/VB anyone/NN who/WP has/VBZ committed/VBN offenses/NNS against/IN Croatian/JJ citizens/NNS abroad/RB ./.

Croats/NNS in/IN Bosnia/NNP automatically/RB have/VBP Croatian/JJ citizenship/NN ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, Croatia/NNP has/VBZ charged/VBN more/JJR than/IN 250/CD Serbs/NNS with/IN crimes/NNS against/IN humanity/NN and/CC genocide/NN allegedly/RB committed/VBN during/IN a/DT six-month/JJ war/NN in/IN Croatia/NNP in/IN 1991/CD after/IN the/DT republic/NN proclaimed/VBD independence/NN from/IN Serb-dominated/NNP Yugoslavia/NNP ./.

Fewer/JJR than/IN 10/CD of/IN the/DT Serbs/NNPS are/VBP in/IN custody/NN ./.

The/DT exact/JJ number/NN is/VBZ unknown/JJ ./.
