Japan Wins Men's 10,000m Speedskating Gold
The triumph also boosted Japan to a joint-leadership with China in the
Games' speedskating competition, with three golds each under their
belt.
Ttokawa, fourth place finisher in the 5,000m on Tuesday, clocked 15
minutes 5.15 seconds for the victory, followed by China' s Liu Guangbin
at 15:07.39 and South Korean Moon Jun at 15:08.91.
Earlier in the morning, veteran skater Xue Ruihong won her second gold
in the sport when she led a Chinese sweep in the women' s 1000m race to
award her country the thirteenth gold in the whole gold medal count and
the third in the speedskating.
China's another speedskating gold came from the exciting young star
Song Li, who was Thursday inspired by Xue's victorious 500m race on
Wednedsay to claim the women's 1,500m.
Hosts South Korea came second in the speedskating gold tally, thanks to
Choi Jae-bong's back-to-back wins in the men's 1,000m and 1,500m.
Kazakhstan, who notched up two golds in Harbin four years ago, made
only one gold this time through the men's 5,000m.
