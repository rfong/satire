Haut de la Garenne: army probes IRA links to Jersey's Hohlgangsanlage 8 Nazi
Underground Hospital
The Ministry of Defence has sent in a crack team of excavation specialists
to the Haut de la Garenne children's home.
This follows the discovery that the grim house of horror cellars are
linked to a subterranean network of tunnels connected to the World War
II Hohlgangsanlage 8 German Underground Hospital.
Dubbed Jersey's War Tunnels the underground complex was built by Hitler
in 1941 using some indigenous forced labour as well as POW slaves.
The site was never fully utilised and was opened to the public in July
1946 by the States of Jersey following the liberation of the Channel
Islands. It eventually became a wartime museum.
However between the mid-1960s to 1970s the disused site is believed to
have shielded a renegade ragbag of disaffected ex-British army
squaddies who squatted there, planning revenge for their court martials
after a hushed-up massacre fiasco at a British base on Cyprus.
A number of these disgraced former soldiers had close links to UK
mobster cartels whose flag of convenience for many years was the
Provisional IRA.
Some among them also had close connections to dubious employees in the
children's home now being probed in a huge paedophile investigation.
"In a matter of days we should be able to announce a breakthrough in
the subterranean probe," Insp Jim Bergerac of the Jersey police service
said today.
