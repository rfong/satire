Thai central bank lowers forecast for 1997 current account deficit 
Bank of Thailand governor Rerngchai Marakanond said Friday the current
account deficit was expected to be less than five percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) in 1997, much lower than earlier forecast.
The deficit had improved due to lower imports and stood at a monthly
average 19 billion baht (731 million dollars) in January and February,
resulting in likely changes to yearly projections, he said.
"The latest average figure was below the 30 billion baht previously
expected on a monthly basis and a forecast of 6.9 pct of GDP for the
year," said the central bank chief.
"It means the deficit this year should be lower (than) five percent of
GDP," Rerngchai said, adding that the improved figure reflected
economic stability.
The current account deficit fell to 14.7 billion baht in February from
22.5 billion baht in January as the trade deficit fell to 21.7 billion
baht from 39 billion baht, the bank said Thursday.
BOT spokeswoman Kleothong Hetrakul said the improvement in the trade
data reflected a fall in imports, not higher exports, and said the
economy had not "yet shown signs of bottoming out."
