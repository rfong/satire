Afghan leader meets Hoon in Kabul 
Interim Afghan leader Hamid Karzai met British Defence Secretary Geoff
Hoon here Tuesday for talks expected to focus on security and
international troop levels, officials said.
Colonel Richard Eaton, spokesman for the International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF), told reporters Hoon had arrived in Kabul
earlier Tuesday and would leave in the afternoon for Pakistan.
Karzai last week appealed to British Prime Minister Tony Blair in
London for a more robust foreign troop presence amid persistent
outbreaks of factional infighting and banditry.
Britain currently leads the UN-mandated force, which began deploying
here in December and is due to number some 4,500 soldiers at its peak
in mid-February.
Britain's leadership, under the command of Major General John McColl,
will last for three months, after which another country, most probably
Turkey, will take over for a further 12 weeks.
Hoon said last month there would be a "significant reduction" in the
number of British troops deployed to the region after London's
leadership role expired.
His meeting with Karzai took place at the presidential palace
immediately after the Afghan leader hoisted the country's new flag for
the first time since the UN-backed interim cabinet took office in
December.
