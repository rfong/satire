China's Output of Timber Continues to Decline 
China's output of timber in the first two months of 2000 plummeted 11.5
percent on an annual basis to 6.11 million cubic meters, according to
the National Bureau of Statistics.
The Chinese government has imposed ban on irrational lumbering in many
forest areas, particularly those on the upper reaches of major rivers
in a bid to curb soil erosion.
Many experts have blamed the excessive logging of trees in the past as
one of the major reasons for the devastating flooding in southern and
northeastern China in the summer of 1998.
