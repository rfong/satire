No Christmas joy for England tour party 
Christmas has been cancelled for England's cricketers after they were
told on Friday there will be no traditional holiday celebrations on
tour this year.
Mike Atherton's men were informed they are not being allowed to share
Christmas and New Year festivities with wives, girl friends and
children.
Officials at Lord's are backing the England management's controversial
decision to ban family members from the tour because they fear a repeat
of last winter's "circus" in South Africa.
England's team bosses made their decision ago after considering the
events of Cape Town in late December, when England lost a test match
and a series during a period when the official tour party swelled from
20 to 65.
A letter, outlining the England management's stance, has been sent out
to the 15 members of the winter squad, which leaves for Zimbabwe on
November 25 and then flies to New Zealand for a tour from January
4-March 5.
The decision seems certain to upset some players, with the issue sure
to be discussed further when England's squad gather at Headingley next
week for initial fitness assessments in the build up to what is a
crucial tour with next summer's Ashes series in mind.
A number of England players have already expressed their unhappiness
about having to leave close family at home over the holiday period
during what is a three-and-a-half month trip.
But Tim Lamb, the Test and County Cricket Board's chief executive
elect, said: "We have supported the management's recommendation,
although we understand that this decision will cause disappointment,
especially with those players with young families.
"But the decision was made in the interests of the tour. If, however,
there is widespread concern expressed to the England management next
week then they might come back to us on this."
