News Analysis: Iran Drops Khomeini's Fatwa to Promote EU Trade
Iran has almost come to a decision to drop the late leader Ayatollah
Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, hoping for normal relations,
trade in particular, with the European countries.
Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi today said in a local
report that the European Union proposed plan for increased trade with
the Islamic Republic is still under consideration and a response will
be announced soon.
At the same time, he stated, "Iran had repeatedly said it will not send
out any commando to kill Rushdie, and it does not interfere with the
domestic affairs of other countries."
Moreover, the senior Iranian diplomat reaffirmed the official stance
that "Iran has also denounced terrorism in any shape or form."
Observers here noted that the above statement by the Iranian deputy
foreign minister serves as an official response by the Iranian
government to the governments of EU member states.
This has been affirmed openly by top officials such as President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, Secretary of
the High Council of National Security Hassen Rouhani.
They said that the official statement also serves as an eager and
urgent gesture by Iran to improve relations with the EU countries and
expand trade with them in the present crucial moment as the United
States announced overall trade and investment embargo on Iran.
Iran worries very much about the coming G-7 meeting next month because
U.S. President Bill Clinton will try his best to press its allies to
follow U.S. embargo on Iran.
Observers said that the latest statement by the senior Iranian official
has met the requirement put forward by the EU member states, which
asked the Iranian government for a guarantee containing three important
principles:
-- Iran will never take any action for the assassination of Salman
Rushdie.
-- Iran's relations with other countries will be based on international
laws, including non-interference in the internal affairs of these
countries.
-- Iran will condemn terrorism in any form.
As European Union envoys, the ambassadors of France, Germany and Spain
-- representing the past, present and future presidents of the European
Union -- met here on April 19 with Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohammad Javad Zarif with a demand of not carrying out the fatwa or
religious edict, that condemns Rushdie to death.
They were seeking an official pledge from the Iranian government not to
harm British author Salman Rushdie as one of the conditions to
normalize their relations.
Relations between Iran and Britain strained over the Rushdie issue.
The Indian-born writer, Salman Rushdie, went into hiding after February
14, 1989, when the late Iranian leader Khomeini called on Moslems to
kill Rushdie because his novel, "The Satanic Verses," allegedly
blasphemed Islam.
Moslem fundamentalists reacted violently to the book after its
publication in 1988.
But the controversy snowballed after Khomeini issued the death decree
and several Iranian leaders put some 6 million U.S. dollar bounty on
Rushdie's head.
Khomeini's edict led to a sharp deterioration in relations between Iran
and Britain and other Western countries, with Britain and Iran
withdrawing their diplomatic representatives and personnel.
Following the debacle over the issue, Tehran and London resumed their
diplomatic ties in late 1990, but only on the charge d'affaires level.
