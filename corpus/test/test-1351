Austrian President Calls For Better Economic Ties With China 
Austrian President Thomas Klestil said here Thursday that Austrian
entrepreneurs and their Chinese counterparts should cooperate more in
the new century.
The president made the speech at the "China-Austria Economic Day," a
gathering co-organized by the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade and the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber to marked
the 35th anniversary of China-Austria economic and trade relations.
China, as a major economic powerhouse, will play an even greater role
in the economic development of the Asian-Pacific region and the world
as well in the new century, Klestil said.
The president said Austria is glad to see the fast growing economic and
trade relations with China, and asked the 80-plus Austrian
entrepreneurs accompanying him on his visit to China to expand their
economic and trade links with China.
About 200 people, including Austrian Minister of Economics Martin
Bartenstein, Austrian and Chinese businessmen, and China's trade
officials, attended the gathering.
The bilateral trade volume between the two countries reached nearly 800
million U.S. dollars last year, up 14 percent from a year ago and the
most in history. By the end of 2000, the number of Austrian-invested
ventures in China was 422, involving a contractual investment of 510
million U.S. dollars.
On Wednesday, entrepreneurs from the two countries signed 28 contracts
of cooperation here, covering the areas of iron and steel, finance,
environmental protection, construction materials and machinery.
Klestil said he was deeply impressed by the huge developments taking
place in China through his several visits. He said he hopes China joins
the World Trade Organization as soon as possible.
