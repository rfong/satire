Pakistan Urges India to Be Serious towards Dialogue 
Pakistan said Saturday that it wants to push forward the process of
dialogue with India, and urged New Delhi to show "seriousness towards
critical issues and address the Kashmir dispute - the root cause of
tensions."
Speaking at a weekly press briefing, a Pakistani Foreign Ministry
spokesman said: "We very much want the process of dialogue commenced
and we hope that in Colombo when the two prime ministers (of Pakistan
and India) meet the dialogue process will push forward."
The spokesman regretted "the non-serious attitude" on the part of the
Indian side towards the dialogue.
"Let us hope that New Delhi comes up with a better attitude, a more
serious attitude and address the urgent issues including the peace and
security and the root-cause of the tensions."
In response to a question about the third-party mediation over Kashmir,
he said: "In no other dispute has there been a more categorical
rejection of a third party role as on Kashmir by India."
The spokesman also said Pakistan is keeping its options open with
regard to signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and is
carrying out a strategic review in this context.
"We have to remain conscious of the demand made on our capability, if
we feel that the strategic parity in the region is threatened we will
take appropriate measures to correct the strategic imbalance," he
added.
"Pakistan is following an integrated and a comprehensive approach on
the issue and will keep a watch on various elements," he said. "We
cannot allow the strategic imbalance in the region because Pakistan's
security is of paramount importance to us."
As long as India does not sign the test ban treaty, Pakistan will keep
its options open, the spokesman stressed.
"We will take the decision when we consider it in our interest and at
an appropriate time and till then we will continue to pursue a
comprehensive approach," he said.
