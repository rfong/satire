Nader and Jesus in '08
Last week, a sizable gathering of conservative religious leaders
retreated to Utah to eat salt-water taffy and discuss their collective
disappointment with the front runners in Republican presidential field.
Upset that pro-choice, anti-gun candidate Rudy Giuliani's political
halo is still gleaming, they've decreed:
If there is a pro-abortion nominee [elected in the primary] we will
consider working with a third party...
As soon as I read the news, I subleased my apartment on Craigslist,
bought a bio-diesel pick-up truck, and headed West to translate my
views into the political psalms of the heartland. Here are the
beginnings of a new message. I am still the same old Nader, just with a
much broader and, albeit, more pious base this go around.
...
Pro-life: I'm not afraid to say that the life of a sapling begins at
germination. I am totally opposed to the abhorrent and immoral
procedure of clear-cutting -- except, of course, in the rare cases
where the health of the forest ecosystem is at risk.
2nd Amendment: I'm 100 percent in favor of the right to bear arms. Let
it also be known, that I full-heartedly support bear legs, and for the
most part, the torso.
Creationism: Like Eve from the rib of Adam, we as a nation must create
more and better jobs; not ship them outside of this garden we call
America. The serpents in our midst are NAFTA and the WTO, and the only
thing that must "evolve" is the domestic consumer's demand for good ol'
American craftsmanship.
Family Values: Despite not having any actual children, I have written a
book on parenting. Not having offspring has other benefits. It means I
cannot possibly have gay children. Unless I adopt one, which, at my
age, I most certainly will not.
