Three Die in Bus Crash near Barcelona, 22 Injured 
A double-decker bus carrying 43 Americans to religious shrines in
France and Portugal swerved off a slippery road and flipped over,
killing three passengers and injuring 22, police said Saturday.
The identities and hometowns of the victims were not immediately
available but they all were from parishes throughout central and
northern Arizona, said Marge Injasoulian, spokeswoman for the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Phoenix.
The diocesan spokeswoman said Bishop Thomas O'Brien had spoken to
families of some of the victims and would make a statement Sunday.
The Arizona Republic reported Sunday that all the passengers were taken
to hospitals.
The newspaper also quoted Clyde Howard, an employee at the U.S.
Consulate in Barcelona, as identifying two of the dead as Elsie Saint,
63, of Phoenix, and Joan Ryan, 62. The other fatality was an
unidentified 81-year-old woman Howard said.
The accident occurred about 8:30 a.m. near Abrera, a town 25 miles (40
kilometers) north of Barcelona.
One of the uninjured Arizonans told a Phoenix television station
Saturday night that it appeared as though the bus could have been going
too fast or didn't negotiate the turn.
``I was sitting in the back of the bus,'' Thomas Rothery of Phoenix
told KSAZ-TV from Barcelona. ``We were headed for Lourdes, France. We
were going to spend New Year's Eve there. It was wet outside because it
had rained the night before. The bus driver was driving on the road and
we had to take a left and the road kind of swerved left. I don't know
if he was driving a little too fast or didn't make a sharp enough turn
but the bus skidded and turned sideways.''
The bus driver ``turned, and he went across the white line, and he
tried to correct, and that's when the bus turned over,'' Bertha Bower,
76, of Phoenix, told the Republic from Catalunya General Hospital in
Barcelona.
The trip was led by the Rev. Dan Irby, director of the Newman Center at
Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff.
Kathleen Ballou, administrator of the Flagstaff center, told the
Republic those on the trip consisted of children, NAU students and
senior citizens.
The tourists had planned to stop at Andorra, the tiny mountain state
between France and Spain, before heading to Lourdes in southwestern
France, said Antonio Jarillo, director of Viajes Casals, the tourist
agency that organized the trip.
They planned to then visit the shrine of Fatima in central Portugal
before returning to Madrid, the Spanish capital, Jarillo told the
independent news agency Europa Press. They were scheduled to return to
the United States next Saturday.
About 15 people remained hospitalized Saturday night, Howard said,
adding that most were expected to be released within a couple of days.
