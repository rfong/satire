Algerian Gov't to Offer Bonus for Catching Terrorists 
Algerian government will offer 100,000 to 450,000 francs (20,000 to
90,000 U.S. dollars) of bonus for providing information which will help
"the arrest or elimination of the chief terrorists," according to a
report by the Algerian daily, Liberty, today.
The report said that the government will publish the measure in the
coming days.
The Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said Tuesday in an interview
with French television that the Islamic extremist groups in the country
have now become "a killing machine without political, religious or
popular ideal."
He said that the terrorists have been defeated and their effort to
overthrow the state institutions foiled.
Meanwhile, the Algerian parliament, the Conseil National de Transition,
adopted on Tuesday a new law on the creation of political parties in
Algeria.
The law bans Algerians from founding political parties on the basis of
religions, languages or regionalism.
