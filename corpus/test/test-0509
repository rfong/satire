Netanyahu Says US-Israeli Gaps Narrowed 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that differences
between Israel and the United States over the Middle East peace process
have been narrowed following his meeting with President Bill Clinton
Tuesday.
According to an Israeli Cabinet statement, Netanyahu briefed his
ministers on his talks with Clinton and other American officials last
week in Washington.
Netanyahu said efforts will be made to carry out Clinton's proposal
that would have Israel hand over small parcels of land in the second
redeployment while the Palestinians take matching steps against
terrorists.
He said that any deal worked out with the U.S. will be brought to the
cabinet to formulate its own resolution. He also conceded that there
are still some gaps between the Israeli and American positions on the
peace talks.
Netanyahu reiterated in the cabinet that Israel will not hand over any
more territory to the Palestinians until a clear course is set by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to fulfill its security
commitments as stipulated in the Israeli-Palestinian accords.
He said he had made it clear in Washington that the Israeli list of its
national interests in the territories is not a tactic to restrict the
further redeployment but rather a substantive issue.
During his talks with Clinton, Netanyahu insisted that before Israel
implements the second redeployment in the West Bank, the Palestinian
National Council must be reconvened to cancel all the articles in the
Palestinian Covenant calling for Israel's destruction.
However, Clinton demanded that Israel commence its redeployment
immediately, while the Palestinians would also begin to comply with
their part in the agreement.
Referring to the letter handed by the PNA President Yasser Arafat to
Clinton, which specified that those anti-Israeli articles have been
repealed, Netanyahu declared that a letter is not enough but rather
authorized bodies must make such a decision.
Netanyahu also warned the Palestinians that Israel would react firmly
if Palestinians resort to, or threaten violence.
He said that Israel will not agree to conduct a peace process under
dictates of violence and the Palestinian side should understand the
only option to the peace is deliberation and achieving understanding
with Israel.
On Saturday, Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Islamic
fundamentalist Hamas movement, called on all the Palestinians to unite
in an armed struggle against Israel.
He said this is "the only way left to the Palestinians to gain their
rights and achieve their goals" and called on Arafat to join the
movement in waging a "holy war" against Israeli occupiers.
