Dollar steady in holiday trade 
The dollar was steady against other leading currencies on Monday, after
the yen recovered from a brief fall triggered by an apparent gaffe by
US President George W. Bush.
The single European currency was quoted at 0.8729 dollars against
0.8734 dollars late on Friday in New York.
The dollar changed hands for 132.65 yen from 132.61 on Friday.
With US markets shut for the Presidents' Day holiday, trading volumes
were expected to be light.
But there was some excitement in Tokyo trading as the Japanese currency
lurched lower after Bush said that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi had talked to him about "devaluation."
"He talked about non-performing loans, the devaluation issue and
regulatory reforms. He stressed all three with the same importance,"
Bush told a news conference after the pair held a summit in Tokyo.
But dealers later concluded that the gaffe-prone US president had
probably in fact meant to say "deflation," a key issue for the
recession-ridden Japanese economy.
"The dollar/yen immediately went higher when it came out that he had
said devaluation, it caused a bit of a panic and people sold the yen on
the headline," said a trader at Barclays Capital in Tokyo.
"But very soon after people realised that perhaps he meant to say
deflation but got confused," she said.
"So there was an initial spark reaction but as soon as people thought
about it (they realised Bush had made a mistake) and the dollar
reversed back to its former levels."
That left the dollar holding steady against both the yen and euro, with
little in the way of data expected to drive markets.
"Last week's price action in the currency markets was uninspiring
despite the importance of some of the US data releases, and the start
of this week is likely to be equally as unexciting," said Commerzbank
economist Kamal Sharma.
There will be some interest though in US consumer price data on
Wednesday, British retail sales figures on Thursday and French
fourth-quarter growth figures on Friday.
But although US data have so far this year mainly indicated that US
economic growth had bottomed out, the market remains hesitant in taking
overly aggressive dollar positions, Sharma said.
"This current trend is unlikely to change in this quarter, with
technical range trading likely to be the dominant driver of currency
movements," he wrote in a note to clients.
The euro was being traded at 0.8729 dollars from 0.8734 in New York
late on Friday, at 115.80 yen (115.83), 0.6090 pounds (0.6100) and
1.4818 Swiss francs (1.4823).
The dollar was at 132.65 yen (132.61) and 1.6985 Swiss francs (1.6972).
Sterling bought 1.4334 dollars from 1.4316 in New York, 190.14 yen
(189.84) and 2.4346 Swiss francs (2.4300).
The price of gold slipped to 298.10 dollars an ounce from 299.85
dollars late on Friday.
