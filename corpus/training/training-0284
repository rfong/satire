Tunisian Coach Says Battle not Over 
Tunisian coach Henri Kasperczak said after their 2-0 loss to England
here on Monday that the battle for a place in the second round was not
over.
He said, "For us the battle to enter the next round is not over yet. We
still have two games ahead. We will continue our campaign and we still
have chances."
He added, "This was a well-matched game. It was a true battle, but the
Englishmen were more effective. Conceding a goal near the end of the
first half was really difficult for us psychologically."
Kasperczak added, "We had played a good second half, but we had not
capitalized on several scoring chances."
The Tunisian coach was apparently impressed by the strength of the
English midfield which featured Paul Scholes, Paul Ince and Darren
Anderton.
"England had very fluent crossing in the midfield. They have very good
midfielders, which connected the ball well with the strikers."
