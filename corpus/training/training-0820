Two Egyptians Wounded by Gunfire Near Border with Palestine 
Two Egyptian farmers were wounded Sunday by gunfire in Rafah bordering
southern Gaza, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
Egyptian police were quoted as saying that the bullets came from
Israeli soldiers who were shooting at Palestinian demonstrators on the
other side of the border.
The two Egyptians were harvesting their olives near Salaheddin Street
in Rafah, about 400 meters from the borderline when they were hit by
stray bullets. The border line across the town separates Rafah into two
parts, one of which is under Egypt's North Sinai governorate.
The border town between Egypt and the Palestinian territories has been
closed by Israeli security forces for much of the last month since the
eruption of bloody clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli
soldiers on September 28.
This is the first time that Egyptian civilians were injured by bullet
splinters when Israeli troops were firing on Palestinians.
It was reported that last month when Israeli soldiers shot at
Palestinian youths who threw rocks and bottles at them, some stray
bullets had hit buildings in the town across the border on the Egyptian
side, where 40,000 people live.
But Egypt denied there was such an incident.
