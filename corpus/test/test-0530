Jakarta stocks close 0.6 percent lower 
The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index closed at 624.46 points on
Friday or 3.66 points lower from the previous week's close.
"Jakarta was in line with the drop of the Dow Jones, and had gone down
some just like the other bourses in the region," Vickers Ballas Tamara
head of research David Chang said.
Average daily volume on the exchange saw 319.3 million shares worth
373.2 million dollars traded, compared to last week's 211.8 million
shares worth 191.8 million dollars.
The government's secondary public offering of some 388 million shares
of state phone company PT Telkom on Wednesday was partially responsible
for the high transaction volume this week, Chang said.
He added that the bourse next week "would probably be quieter, with
many people getting ready to take their end-of-the-year leave."
