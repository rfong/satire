Proposed Luanda summit on DR Congo falls through 
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said Friday he had failed to
convince the leaders of nations embroiled in the war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) to meet in Luanda for a summit.
"We have worked to prepare a summit for heads of state" of Angola,
Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe, Dos Santos said. "But this summit has been
cancelled."
He told reporters after a brief visit by DRC President Joseph Kabila
that ministerial work "has not gone far enough" to meet the conditions
for the summit.
"We will continue to make efforts and consultations with all the
parties concerned to succeed in bringing peace and stability to the
Congo and the region," he said.
He said talks on the war would carry on in Malawi, where the 14 members
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), plus the
presidents of Rwanda and Uganda, are meeting Monday to discuss the DRC
and the crisis in Zimbabwe.
Angola and Zimbabwe have deployed troops to support the DRC government,
while Rwanda and Uganda back rebel groups.
Kabila's visit came two days after a visit by Rwandan President Paul
Kagame. Kabila was in Zimbabwe on Thursday to meet with President
Robert Mugabe.
