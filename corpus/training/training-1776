China Active in Cultural Exchange in 1998 (2)
In 1998, Sun jiazheng became China's first culture minister to visit
Africa. A Chinese acrobatics troupe went on a tour to perform in 12
Caribbean and Central American countries from June to September,
China's longest performance abroad in 20 years, and these countries
included Panama and Grenada, with which China has no diplomatic
relations.
Last March, a Chinese culture delegation attended an international
conference on cultural policies sponsored by United Nations Education,
Science and Culture Organization. Chinese artists also achieved a great
deal in international competitions. A Chinese dancer for the first time
won an award at the Bapha International Ballet Contest, one of the
world's toughest ballet competitions. Chinese acrobats won a gold medal
at one of the world's key acrobatics competitions, the Monte Carlo
International Acrobatics Competition.
After the '96 International Philharmonic Year and the '97 International
Year of Dance and Opera,came the International Painting Year in 1998,
with a series of art exhibitions of painters from Russia, Belgium,
Romania, and other countries.
Last October, China held the Asian Art Festival,attracting over ten
groups from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Republic of
Korea, Japan, and five other countries.
In looking forward to 1999, Sun said he believes that China's 50th
anniversary celebration and the return of Macao will mean both
opportunities and challenges for cultural exchanges, but that he is
confident that they can embrace the new century in a more colorful way
through more exchanges.
