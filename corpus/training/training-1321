Manila privatizes small cargo airline 
Pacific East Asia Cargo Airline, a small company facing extinction with
the planned entry of US giant Federal Express, is to be privatized, an
aide to President Fidel Ramos announced Wednesday.
Legal aide Antonio Carpio said in a memorandum to Ramos that Pacific
East, 80 percent owned by the government's Philippine Aerospace
Development Corp. (PADC), had a negative net worth of 105.4 million
pesos (3.9 million dollars) as of the end of 1993.
It said the airline needed additional funds to survive, especially in
the face of competition from firms like Federal Express, which has
announced plans to make the former US naval facility at Subic Bay its
regional hub.
He said PADC's partner in the firm, TNT Express Worldwide (Philippines)
Inc., has "expressed interest in purchasing the shares," but gave no
other details. TNT Express officials could not be reached for comment.
