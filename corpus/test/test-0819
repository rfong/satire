Hezbollah Vows Reprisals Against Israeli Shelling 
Lebanon's Muslim military group Hezbollah has vowed to conduct attacks
to avenge the Israeli shelling on Sunday which wounded 10 Lebanese
civilians.
The Voice of the People radio Monday quoted Hezbollah's south commander
Nabil Qaouq as saying the Israeli "enemy" has violated the cease-fire
understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel in 1996.
The agreement, which was brokered by the United States to end a 16-day
Israeli blitz on Lebanon, prohibits any attacks on civilian targets or
from civilian areas on both sides of the Lebanese-Israeli border.
Qaouq's comments came shortly after 10 Lebanese civilians, mostly
children, were wounded Sunday afternoon when Israeli artillery troops
blasted villages in south Lebanon in an apparent bid to find the
hideouts of guerrilllas of Hezbollah, or Party of God.
Qaouq said Hezbollah considers itself responsible for the security of
Lebanese civilians, vowing to launch retaliatory attacks at an
appreciated time.
In the past, Hezbollah always chose to fire Katyusha rockets into
northern Israel as responses to Israeli assaults on Lebanese civilians.
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon in 1985
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movements spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah have been fighting to oust Israeli occupation
forces out of the country.
