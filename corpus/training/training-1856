U.S. Attorney General Issues New Terrorism Alert
U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft warned on Monday that there may be
additional terrorist attacks within the United States and against U.S.
interests abroad within the next week.
The warning was issued on the basis of the information the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received about possible attacks, he said,
urging U.S. agencies, citizens and interests abroad to be on "high
alert."
The administration viewed the threat as credible, Ashcroft said at a
press conference at the Justice Department, but unfortunately it did
not contain specific information as to the type of attack or specific
targets.
"The warning should be taken seriously," he said.
Ashcroft told reporters that a terrorist threat advisory update has
been issued to 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the country.
The alert is the second of its kind this month. The FBI warned on
October 11 that additional terrorism attacks could occur within days.
President George W. Bush also said earlier Monday that "the country
must stay on alert" as "our enemies still hate us."
