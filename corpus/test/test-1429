Light winds prevail here, impairing every team's abilty to get true
readings on comparative boat speeds. Bertrand would rather see the
winds in the lighter range than unseasonably heavy.
"Since you generally have light winds in San Diego, this isn't as bad
as it may look," he said.
"Certainly we wouldn't want to be racing in just medium to fresher
winds. That would give you a false reading for what is to come.
"The conditions we've had are reasonably close to what we expect to
see. We've been in the correct range for 70 to 80 percent of the
races."
Since the racing began a month ago, oneAustralia's pre-trials disputes
with defending San Diego Yacht Club over tobacco advertising and the
alleged violation of the two-boat limit have been all but forgotten.
"Our team didn't see much of the dispute before they got here," said
Bertrand. "And there's not much to see now at all.
"The locals have been terrific. The culture of Southern California is
the closest match possible to Australia. It has been very easy for our
team to assimilate into the San Diego community."
The bottom line hasn't changed, though. Bertrand wants to take the
America's Cup to Australia for a second visit.
"It's a good time for our new boat. We've yet to see the new technology
out of Japan. And the French are starting to move forward," he said.
Japan plans to introduce the new Nippon hull in the fourth round-robin.
