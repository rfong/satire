Thais Asked Not to Panic Over Amoebic Attack
Suphamit Chunsuthiwat of the ministry's communicable diseases control
department was quoted as saying that the chance of infection was very
slim but, if infected, the survival rate was very low.
He said the disease can be contracted only by intake of contaminated
water through the nose or by exposing wounds in contaminated water.
One of the two victims is a 27-year-old man who was believed to have
been infected through drinking holy water from a temple. The other is a
15-year-old girl who was suspected to have been affected while swimming
in a reservoir.
The two victims died Monday and Tuesday respectively.
Experts warned people who wear contact lens or suffer from infected
wound, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and diabetes not to
swim in natural water resources because they are vulnerable to the
infection.
Local news reports on the amoebic brain attacks drew a lot of attention
from the public. Many people phoned hospitals to inquire about the
event all of the day.
