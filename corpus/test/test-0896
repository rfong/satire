New American U.N. Ambassador Presents Credentials 
The new U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, Richard
Holbrooke, Tuesday presented his credentials to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
Holbrooke was accompanied by acting U.S. Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott during the ceremonial activity.
The new U.N. ambassador, who just returned from his Balkan tour, told
reporters that Talbott's presence symbolized the U.S. "high and
continuing commitment to the United Nations, to the importance of the
work that it does and to engage in serious substantive discussion of
several major problems that are confronting the U.N."
However, he did not say any word on how his mission is going to deal
with the back dues the U.S. owes to the United Nations. The United
States has become the largest debtor by owing 1.6 billion U.S. dollars
in arrears.
The New York-born Holbrooke, 58, joined the U.S. foreign service in
1962 and has held a string of senior posts, including as ambassador to
Germany and as an assistant secretary of state.
His predecessor at the United Nations, Bill Richardson, left last year
to become the U.S. secretary of energy.
Also Tuesday, the permanent representatives of Austria, Barbados and
Kenya presented their credentials to Annan.
