Bangladesh Attracts More Foreign Direct Investments: World Bank 
Bangladesh attracts growing foreign direct investment (FDI), a top
official of the World Bank' s International Finance Corporation (IFC)
was quoted by the official BSS news agency as saying on Tuesday.
The IFC Executive Vice President and Managing Director of the World
Bank Peter Woicke said the IFC is investing in Bangladesh to spur the
growth of the private sector as means of reducing poverty.
Woicke said the IFC's investments in Bangladesh, which totaled 54.5
million U.S. dollars as of November 1999, focus on the basic needs for
thriving private sectors -- power, gas, cement, communications and a
developed financial sector as well.
Woicke will visit Bangladesh from February 10 to 14 to encourage
further investments.
