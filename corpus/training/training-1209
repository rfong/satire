Olympic Technicians' "Go-Slow" Cancels 19 Domestic Flights 
Domestic flights in Greece have been seriously disrupted today
following an overtime ban by technicians and mechanics of Greek airline
Olympic Aviation.
Some 19 scheduled flights were cancelled this morning as a result of
staff refusing to work overtime, Theodosis Arbatzoglou, president of
the technicians and mechanics' labor union said.
He complained that the company's flight schedule relied entirely on
overtime work, which often meant employees having to work an additional
six to ten hours after their regular eight-hour shift.
"We are working our normal eight-hour shifts to press for the hiring of
seasonal staff who are necessary for maintaining the normal flights
schedule," he stressed.
Olympic Aviation said today it would announce within the next few hours
a new flight schedule for the next fortnight, reducing the number of
flights to and from the Greek islands.
