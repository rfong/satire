Sensitive Index on BSE Rises 52.71 Points 
The sensitive index on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market Monday
closed at 3378.40 as against last Thursday's close of 3325.69, netting
a rise of 52.71 points or 1.58 per cent.
The national index rose by 28.81 points to 1478.45 from the previous
close of 1449.64.
The BSE-200 index and the U.S. dollar index were quoted remarkably up
at 337.29 and 131.26 compared with last weekend close of 331.29 and
128.81 respectively.
Equities failed to maintain initial higher levels, trimming the gains
by over 50 per cent on the opening day of the new account on the stock
market today due to late selling pressure from operators and slowdown
of purchases by foreign institutional investors.
