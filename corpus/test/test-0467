Digital to slash 7,000 jobs in restructuring 
The US computer firm Digital Equipment, faced with disappointing
quarterly results, said Tuesday it would abolish 7,000 jobs in the next
12 months under a 475 million dollar restructuring effort.
The conpany said results from its fourth qarter, which ended June 29,
will be released July 30.
But already the Massachusetts-based firm is describing the perfomance
as "well below ... expectations."
"Although we have made significant progress, particularly with respect
to establishing a long-term strategy, we obviously are not satisfied
with the current business financial results," said Digital chairman
Robert Palmer.
"The financial performance of our personal computer business is
unacceptable. In addition, we are experiencing a significant slowdown
in several European markets."
Vincent Mullarkey, vice president and chief financial officer, said the
company expected fourth quarter profits to be significantly below
current estimates, with revenue lower than the same period last year.
"We understand our business problems," Mullarkey said. "Our management
team is taking the steps necessary to address those problems.
A digital statement disclosed that the 475 million dollar restructuring
charge would cover the cost of eliminating around 7,000 positions
worldwide over the next 12 months and related facility consolidations.
"This additional restructuring enables the company to move to the next
level of efficiency and lower cost structure necessary to attain
competitive financial performance," said Palmer.
Palmer stressed that Digital's 64-bit Alpha-based systems and services
sector was showing growth.
He insisted that a 500 million dollar contract announced June 25 with
Citibank was proof of Digital's increasing strength in the service
area.
The company's strategic alliances with Microsoft, Oracle, MCI and
Computer Associates, together with the semiconductor alliances with
Samsung Electronics and Mitsubishi Electric, are further demonstrations
of the company's success, according to Palmer.
"Digital clearly is well-positioned for continued growth in our
strategic products and services portfolio," he added.
"We are confident that we will be back on track and showing significant
financial improvement by the end of the calendar year."
