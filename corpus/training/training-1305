Syrian-Egyptian Trade Expands Rapidly in 1996 
Trade volume between Syria and Egypt in 1996 rose to 252 million
Egyptian pounds (about 74 million U.S. dollars), according to the
Egyptian Embassy here today.
This was about 88 percent up from five years ago when the figure stood
at 134 million pounds (about 39 million dollars).
A breakdown of last year's trade volume showed that Syrian exports
register at 52 million pounds (about 15 million dollars) and Egyptian
exports to Syria 200 million pounds (about 59 million dollars).
An Egyptian commercial attache who was here attending the current
Damascus international exhibition said Syrian exports to Egypt include
tobacco, lintel, spices and certain plants.
Egypt is exporting to Syria rice, oil, lubricants, tourist buses,
medicine and chemicals, he added.
Under an agreement signed by the two countries in 1961, 19 Syrian and
20 Egyptian commodities are exempt from customs duties.
Egypt sent 57 companies to take part in the ongoing international fair
in the Syrian capital. The products on display include foodstuffs,
washing machines, refrigerators, stoves, chemicals, minerals and
pharmaceutical products.
