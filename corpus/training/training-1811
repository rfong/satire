Russian Nemov Wins Vault Gold 
Alexei Nemov of Russia chalked up a gold in the men's vault event of
the Olympic gymnastics competitions here on Monday.
The Russian collected 9.762 points in his first attempt and 9.812 in
his second for an average point of 9.787.
The 20-year-old Russian, who grabbed a gold in the men's team event,
added the second to his gold credit after a firm landing in his second
vault.
South Korea's Yeo Hong-Chul, 25, runner-up in the World Championships
in San Juan, Puerto Rico, last April, finished second with 9.757
points.
Defending champion Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo, fresh bronze-medalist in
the individual all-around here, was third at 9.724.
Scherbo took the limelight in the gymnastics competition at the
Barcelona Games four years ago by sweeping a total of six golds.
Li Xiaoshuang of China, winner in the individual all-around, made
errors in landing in the first attempt and gained the lowest point of
9.500, which cost him to reach to the poduim. He finished a modest
fourth, alongside with Ivan Ivanov of Bulgaria.
