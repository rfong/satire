Adams says IRA warning casts no doubts on peace process 
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) said Friday it would not surrender its
arms before the start of all-party peace talks on Northern Ireland,
drawing swift rebuke from London and pro-British parties in the
province.
In a statement early Friday, the IRA said there was "no question" that
it would meet the British government's "ludicrous demand for a
surrender of IRA weapons" before the start of all-party talks.
Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein, moved
quickly to dispel fears that the statement cast doubts on the peace
process, given a new lease on life last week by a peace formula put
forward by prime ministers John Major of Britain and John Bruton of
Ireland.
Major lashed out at the IRA position, saying it pointedly ignored the
Irish people's desire for peace.
"IRA intransigence is a slap in the face to the hundreds of thousands
of people in Northern Ireland and the (Irish) republic who last week
demonstrated their massive desire for peace," he said, referring to the
effusive reaction to a visit by US President Bill Clinton.
"It's now up to Gerry Adams to make this message penetrate all corners
of their movement," he said, adding that the IRA should heed the
message of the people to put down their guns.
The question of IRA disarmament has deadlocked the peace process for
months, with the paramilitary group refusing to hand over weapons, as
demanded by London, until all-party talks on Northern Ireland's future
begin.
Last Tuesday, Major and Bruton announced a "twin-track" approach, with
an international commission overseeing disarmament during preliminary
talks, in a move which appeared to breathe new life into the stalled
process.
The IRA's announcement was, however, read as a sign that the
organisation had ruled out cooperating with the commission.
Hours after the IRA statement, Adams said there were "no fresh doubts"
on the peace process.
"Doubts arise from the British government's refusal to engage
positively into the peace process ... its repeated bad faith," said
Adams.
"We have had and we will continue to have a positive contribution to
the twin-track process," he said. "The issue of disarmament is both
achievable and necessary but without dialogue nothing is possible."
The IRA statement said British "bad faith" and Unionist "intransigence"
had raised a question mark over the future of the twin-track approach,
and demand for a surrender of weapons was blocking dialogue which was
"essential if the causes of conflict are to be removed."
Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew, meeting with Irish Foreign
Secretary Dick Spring in London, called the statement "very unhelpful,
but a restatement of a position with which we are familiar."
The IRA statement came hours after it was confirmed that the
international commission, headed by former US senator George Mitchell,
was to hold its first meeting in New York at the weekend, with
subsequent sessions in Belfast and Dublin next week.
Meanwhile the White House dismissed concerns that the IRA refusal to
turn over its weapons indicated a breakdown in the peace process.
"We are hopeful, based on our conversations with Gerry Adams that Sinn
Fein sees the merits of the twin-track process," White House spokesman
Michael McCurry said.
Democratic Unionist deputy leader Peter Robinson scorned the IRA
warning and said it wrecked hopes of success for the commission and
proved the twin-track process was a non-starter.
"These weasel words show very clearly that the Provisional IRA want to
hold on to their weapons, either because they think they can get
concessions from the government and from others by holding a gun to
their heads," he said.
