International conference on Rwandan reconstruction opens 
A two-day international conference on rebuilding Rwanda after three
months of ethnic carnage opened at the Dutch foreign ministry on
Friday.
President Pasteur Bizimungu, a moderate Hutu leader, arrived for the
meeting on his first European trip since the Tutsi-led Rwandan
Patriotic Front (RPF) seized power in the capital Kigali in July.
He was accompanied by three other members of the RPF-installed
government, Justice Minister Alphonse-Marie Nkubito, Rehabilitation and
Social Reintegration Minister Jacques Bihozagara and Youth Minister
Patrick Mazimpaka.
The conference has been organised by an Amsterdam-based aid agency, the
National Committee for Development Organisation, and sponsored by the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Council of Europe.
The aim is to evalute Rwanda's problems and seek proposals on how best
to rebuild the central African nation and neighbouring countries which
have suffered from damage left in the wake of hundreds of thousands of
refugees.
The meeting, opened by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo, will be
attended by some 125 representatives of African and European
governments and parliaments as well as delegates from several European
aid agencies.
On Tuesday, Nkubito said he would not go to the International Court of
Justice, the United Nation's highest legal authority, based in the
Dutch capital.
"We are waiting for an international court to be set up which will be
decided on by the UN Security Council. It is too early for any other
moves," he said.
The RPF wants to try those responsible for the genocide which was
sparked on April when President Juvenal Habyarimana died in a suspect
aircrash, unleashing an ethnic war in which up to a million people
died.
Hutu former government soldiers and extremist militias are blamed for
turning on the Tutsi minority and moderate Hutus, who had last year cut
a power-sharing deal with the RPF after three years of insurrection.
Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans fled the small highland nation either
during the three-month civil war or in its immediate aftermath when
Hutus fled in fear of reprisals by the new Tutsi-dominated government.
In Kigali, meanwhile, the director-general of the UN World Health
Organisation (WHO) again warned that one of the major problems facing
Rwandas is a series of epidemics, likely to be worsened by the rainy
season.
At a press conference late Thursday, Hiroshi Nakajima listed cholera,
dysentery, meningitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis and other respiratory
diseases, measles and malaria as threats Rwandans had to be protected
from.
Nakajima, who was later due to meet government officials, also noted
that Rwanda is one of the countries most affected by AIDS, with between
20 and 40 percent of the population of some seven million carrying the
virus that causes the disease.
Programmes to combat the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) had
been under way before the war.
Nakajima added that only a quarter of the country's 3,500 health
workers had returned to work and hospitals and dispensaries have been
looted. Other medical personnel are displaced or have been killed.
Even the 200 health ministry vehicles have disappeared, the WHO chief
said.
Before the war, Rwanda's health budget was a "minimal" two dollars per
head per annum, Nakajima said, adding "We can't go on like that."
