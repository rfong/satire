Tearful Palmer bows out to a Masters roar by Erskine McCullough 
An emotional Arnold Palmer walked off the 18th green for the last time
in the Masters here on Saturday to roars of appreciation from a packed
crowd wanting to pay their respect to the player dubbed the King.
Some of the biggest names in golf, including Nick Faldo and Greg
Norman, came out to witness the end of an era.
Palmer struggled to hold back the tears as he made his way through the
20-deep crowd to the scorer's hut to sign his last score.
"I've never seen anything quite like this. I've seen big crowds and
I've seen people but this was unbelieveable," said the 72-year-old
four-time Masters champion.
It was only on Thursday that Palmer decided that his 48th consecutive
Masters was going to be his last.
His 17-over par 89 opening round, matching his worse ever score here,
had convinced him that he no longer had the game over the lengthened
Augusta National.
"I am not sad," said Palmer about his decision. "I'm just going to fade
away and this is the time. There is no question Augusta has meant an
awful lot to me over the years, perhaps the one tournament that kick
started my career. I love Augusta."
Palmer should have had his final farewell on Friday but as he came off
the 13th tee the heavens open and organisers were forced to suspend
play until Saturday.
"I was very excited," joked Palmer. "I had not played on Saturday for a
very long time."
Palmer admitted that he had thought about playing here for two more
years.
"At one point I thought about doing 50 and playing right through but it
just seemed like this is appropiate this year. As you know my game is
really not good," said Palmer.
In fact, it might have been his last professional appearance.
"If I continue to play as poorly as I have recently I will not be out
there. I promise you that," said Palmer.
Masters chairman Hootie Johnson said it would be impossible to list all
of Palmer's achievements over the Augusta National course.
"He has provided us with countless years of excitment and thrills and
has shown us how the game of golf is supposed to be played. We owe a
debt to Arnold and he will always have a very special place in Masters
history," said Johnson.
Greg Norman was equally full of praise.
"I think every player, from the modern player like Tiger Woods to the
old guys like me, should take their hats off to Arnold. He is what golf
is all about. He brought the corporate money, the charisma and the fans
to the game. He will be missed," said Norman.
