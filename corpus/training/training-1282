France welcomes Israeli-Syrian talks 
France welcomed Thursday reports of a positive mood at revived talks
between Israel and Syria, saying it hoped they would eventually produce
a definitive accord.
The foreign ministry said the talks, which began Wednesday at a remote
retreat in eastern Maryland, had Paris' full backing.
"France is ready to support every effort by all sides to reach an
accord," said spokesman Yves Doutriaux, adding that France would also
be willing to help implement an eventual agreement.
Israelis and Syrians held unscheduled late night dinner Wednesday at
the Wye Plantation, where US mediators reportedly proposed a compromise
solution to the key issue of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
The mood of the talks was reported to be good. "Our negotiators feel
that their Syrian counterparts have a broader negotiating mandate than
in the past," said Yossi Beilin, Israel's minister in charge of the
peace process.
