Arafat: Peace Process Needs a Real Push 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is presently frozen and a real push
should be given to restart it, Israel Radio reported.
During his meeting with Israeli Knesset (Parliament) Speaker Avraham
Burg in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Arafat said both Israelis and
Palestinians should work together with U.S., Egyptian and the European
Union envoys to advance the deadlocked talks.
Burg stressed that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is committed to
the peace process and will try his best to reach peace treaties with
both Syria and the Palestinians.
Earlier, Burg's spokesman said his meetings with Arafat and other
senior Palestinian officials were aiming at establishing direct
channels of communications between them.
Friday's meeting was the first between Arafat and a senior Israeli
political figure since his summit meeting with Barak last month failed
to resolve differences over Israeli troops withdrawal map from 6.1
percent of the West Bank land.
The two sides also missed a February 13 deadline for a framework
agreement on final peace as stipulated by the Sharm el Sheikh
memorandum signed last September.
Since then, Arafat reportedly had ordered a halt to official meetings
with the Israeli officials at senior levels.
