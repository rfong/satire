World AIDS Day Marked in Zambia 
A march and then a rally were held here Wednesday to mark the World
AIDS Day with calls for continued fight against the epidemic.
"We must continue to fight this disaster vigorously," said Zambian
Minister of Sport, Youth and Child Development Abel Chambeshi while
addressing the rally.
The theme of the world AIDS campaign this year is "listen, learn, live,
world AIDS campaign with children and young people."
The minister said: "We must listen to the children and the young
people, hear their views and concerns and understand what is vital to
their lives."
"Similarly, we should learn from one another about respect,
participation, support and ways to prevent HIV infection," he said.
"We should live in a community where rights of the children and young
people are protected and where those living with HIV/AIDS are cared
for. We must see that they do not suffer from discrimination," he
added.
He noted that the young people are in fact living in a world of
paradox: they are told to abstain, but at the same time they are
exposed to a barrage of advertisements using sex symbolism to sell
goods, so temptation grows in abundance.
"Our battle has to remain on and on until we eliminate this infection
from our midst," he stressed.
Among the participants were representatives from the United Nations
agencies, bilateral agencies, non-government and community-based
organizations.
Placards were held high inscribed with slogans: Be wise, learn about
AIDS and survive; Abstain, be faithful character.
According to Zambian Health Ministry, an estimated 19.7 percent of the
entire adult population of the country aged 15-49 is currently infected
with HIV/AIDS and the majority of the infections are transmitted
through heterosexual contact.
