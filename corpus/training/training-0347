Bayern want Klinsmann on loan 
German champions Bayern Munich want to sign Jurgen Klinsmann on loan
from Monaco because the four-million dollar transfer fee set by the
French club is too high.
Franz Beckenbauer, a Bayern vice-president after coaching them to the
Bundesliga title last season, confirmed their interest on Thursday when
he spoke to the striker at the German World Cup camp here.
"We can't afford the transfer fee but we are interested in a loan deal
for Jurgen," said Beckenbauer. "The four goals he has scored so far in
the finals prove his worth."
Spanish clubs are also showing an interest in Klinsmann who is leaving
Monaco with a year of his contract remaining.
Meanwhile, Scottish club Celtic are reported to be interested in the
Swiss World Cup defender Dominique Herr, who is out of contract at
Sion.
