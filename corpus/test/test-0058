Australia Tops Brazil, Portugal Beats Finland In 2nd Round 
Australia's Shane Heal cut loose for 36 points Saturday as the Aussies
topped Brazil, 96-88, for their second-straight victory in the VII RTP
Basketball Tournament.
After holding only a 52-49 lead at the half, the Aussies began working
the ball around the perimeter on offense to Heal, who found his range
from the three-point line and started pouring in uncontested jumpers.
Trailing 71-66, Brazil tried clamping down with a half-court press. But
Heal and backcourt partner Paul Rees had little trouble cutting through
to hit big man Tony Ronaldson (19 points) in the paint.
Tonico was top scorer for Brazil with 15 points, while Paulinho
followed with 15.
In the second game, Pedro Nuno sliced through the Finnish defense for
18 points Saturday as Portugal topped Finland, 85-80.
Guard Kari-Pekka Klinga notched 22 points for Finland on 6-for-10
shooting from the 3-point line, while power forward Riku Martinnen,
playing strong under the boards, added 21 more.
But sharp ball movement by the Portuguese opened up Nuno and Carlos
Seixal for unhurried three-pointers, and Nuno had little trouble
driving the lane to set up big men Mike Plowden (7 points) and Jose
Costa (12 points) underneath.
In Sunday's final round, Portugal meets Sao Paulo and Australia takes
on Finland.
