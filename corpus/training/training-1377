Delhi Plunges Into Darkness Due to Power Failure 
The Delhi area has been suffering a blackout since early Tuesday
morning following a major failure of the Northern Grid, which meets the
maximum power demand of the national capital.
"There is a total failure of the Northern Grid and the Delhi government
can hardly do anything about it," Delhi Power Minister Narendra Nath
said.
Delhi's total power requirement was placed at around 2,200 to 2, 300
megawatts and the Northern Grid met over 70 percent of the total.
The power failure badly hit movement of trains of Northern Railway and
had its impact on the Delhi airport.
