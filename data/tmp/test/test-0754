When/WRB ``/`` Tom/NNP Jones/NNP ''/'' was/VBD released/VBN in/IN 1963/CD ,/, the/DT critics/NNS raved/VBD ,/, the/DT box/NN office/NN boomed/VBD and/CC the/DT movie/NN went/VBD on/IN to/TO win/VB four/CD Academy/NNP Awards/NNPS ,/, including/VBG best/JJS director/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO became/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT biggest/JJS hits/NNS of/IN the/DT early/JJ 1960s/NNS ./.

In/IN retrospect/NN ,/, ``/`` Tom/NNP Jones/NNP ''/'' seemed/VBD to/TO distill/VB the/DT heady/JJ excitement/NN of/IN an/DT era/NN when/WRB ``/`` swinging/VBG England/NNP ''/'' was/VBD being/VBG born/VBN ./.

Very/RB briefly/RB ,/, the/DT critical/JJ spotlight/NN that/WDT had/VBD fastened/VBN on/IN Fellini/NNP ,/, Antonioni/NNP ,/, Bergman/NNP and/CC French/NNP New/NNP Wave/NNP directors/NNS swung/VBD back/RB to/TO the/DT British/JJ cinema/NN where/WRB Richardson/NNP ,/, along/IN with/IN Karel/NNP Reisz/NNP and/CC Lindsay/NNP Anderson/NNP ,/, had/VBD refined/VBN the/DT so-called/JJ kitchen/NN sink/NN school/NN of/IN social/JJ realism/NN ./.

What/WP eloquence/NN the/DT genre/NN achieved/VBD had/VBD less/JJR finally/RB to/TO do/VB with/IN slice-of-life/JJ veracity/NN than/IN with/IN the/DT emergence/NN of/IN a/DT young/JJ generation/NN of/IN British/JJ actors/NNS --/: among/IN them/PRP Albert/NNP Finney/NNP ,/, Richard/NNP Harris/NNP ,/, Alan/NNP Bates/NNP and/CC Tom/NNP Courtenay/NNP --/: who/WP brought/VBD an/DT oratorical/JJ fury/NN to/TO their/PRP$ embattled/JJ working-class/JJ characters/NNS ./.

Richardson/NNP had/VBD made/VBN his/PRP$ reputation/NN directing/VBG the/DT stage/NN dramas/NN and/CC later/RB the/DT screen/NN adaptations/NNS of/IN John/NNP Osborne/NNP 's/POS ``/`` Look/NNP Back/NNP in/IN Anger/NNP ''/'' and/CC ``/`` The/DT Entertainer/NNP ,/, ''/'' as/RB well/RB as/IN ``/`` A/DT Taste/NN of/IN Honey/NNP ''/'' and/CC ``/`` The/DT Loneliness/NNPS of/IN the/DT Long/NNP Distance/NNP Runner/NNP ./.

Although/IN ``/`` Tom/NNP Jones/NNP ''/'' dealt/VBD with/IN kitchen/NN sink/NN issues/NNS like/IN class/NN struggle/NN and/CC included/VBD pointedly/RB gory/JJ ,/, mud-caked/JJ scenes/NNS of/IN 18th-century/JJ rural/JJ life/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD also/RB a/DT triumphant/JJ break/NN from/IN the/DT genre/NN ./.

This/DT picaresque/JJ comic/JJ romp/NN ,/, adapted/VBN by/IN Richardson/NNP with/IN Osborne/NNP from/IN Henry/NNP Fielding/NNP 's/POS novel/NN ,/, revelled/VBD voraciously/RB in/IN the/DT physical/JJ world/NN ./.

Everybody/NN in/IN the/DT film/NN ,/, even/RB its/PRP$ villains/NNS ,/, seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB having/VBG a/DT fine/JJ old/JJ time/NN ./.

When/WRB ``/`` Tom/NNP Jones/NNP ''/'' appeared/VBD ,/, England/NNP was/VBD only/RB beginning/VBG to/TO emerge/VB from/IN a/DT grim/JJ postwar/JJ austerity/NN ./.

The/DT film/NN 's/POS flaunting/NN of/IN a/DT delirious/JJ full-blooded/JJ sensuality/NN ,/, a/DT quality/NN rarely/RB found/VBN in/IN British/JJ films/NNS ,/, contributed/VBD immeasurably/RB to/TO its/PRP$ success/NN ./.

With/IN its/PRP$ satirically/NN edged/VBD portrait/NN of/IN a/DT robust/JJ 18th-century/JJ society/NN in/IN which/WDT sexually/RB liberated/JJ youth/NN triumphed/VBD over/IN sour-faced/JJ prudes/NNS ,/, ``/`` Tom/NNP Jones/NNP ''/'' anticipated/VBD the/DT rampant/JJ hedonism/NN that/WDT was/VBD right/JJ around/IN the/DT corner/NN ./.

``/`` Tom/NNP Jones/NNP ''/'' reaches/VBZ a/DT peak/NN of/IN naughtiness/NNS in/IN the/DT notorious/JJ eating/NN scene/NN in/IN which/WDT Finney/NNP and/CC Joyce/NNP Redman/NNP leer/NN at/IN each/DT other/JJ while/NN making/NN lascivious/VBZ overtures/NNS to/TO morsels/NNS from/IN their/PRP$ dinner/NN plates/NNS ./.

Richardson/NNP 's/POS golden/JJ moment/NN was/VBD short-lived/JJ ./.

After/IN ``/`` Tom/NNP Jones/NNP ''/'' he/PRP never/RB directed/VBD another/DT major/JJ hit/NN ./.
