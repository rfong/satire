Bahrain informs UN Security Council of Iranian-backed plot 
Bahrain's foreign minister on Tuesday informed the five permanent
member countries of the UN Security Council of an alleged
Iranian-backed plot to overthrow the government, the official Gulf News
Agency reported.
Sheikh Mohammad ibn Mubarak al-Khalifa gave the ambassadors of the
United States, Britain, Russia, France and China, as well as those of
Arab states and allies, a message from the Bahraini emir about the
plot.
Bahrain said Tuesday it had arrested 44 people linked to an
Iranian-backed Islamic militant group called the military wing of
Hezbollah-Bahrain which plotted to overthrow the government in Manama.
Sheikh Mohammad informed the diplomats of the "results of the
interrogations of the suspects, their confessions on belonging to
Hezbollah-Bahrain and their links to Iran which supports, finances and
trains these elements in Revolutionary Guard camps in Iran," GNA said.
Interior Minister Mohammad ibn Khalifa al-Khalifa said earlier that
security services were still tracking down more members of the group in
hiding.
Bahrain first announced the plot on Monday, the first time that Manama
had openly accused Tehran of involvement in the unrest that has rocked
the Gulf island state since December 1994.
Iran has denied the accusations.
At least 22 people have died in the anti-government violence led by
Shiite Moslems demanding a restoration of the parliament that was
suspended in 1975 by the Sunni Moslem-led authorities.
