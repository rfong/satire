Prime Minister Rao Opposes Common Marriage Laws in India
The government will not meddle with the rules of any individual
community by making marriage laws apply to all religions and sects in
India, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao said Thursday.
``Muslim personal law or any other law for that matter would not be
interfered with,'' Rao told a group of Muslim scholars in Bareilly,
about 250 kilometers (155 miles) east of New Delhi.
Muslims, who comprise 12 percent of India's 900 million people, are
opposed to a common code. The Hindu law does not apply to Muslims,
Christians and Parsees, or Zoroastrians, who have their own personal
laws governing marriage and divorce.
The matter became a sensitive political issue after the Supreme Court
in May urged the federal government to take a ``fresh look'' at the
Indian constitution and enact a common civil code.
The court ruled that bigamy is illegal for a Hindu man even if he
converts to Islam, which permits up to four wives. The ruling came on
petitions from four Hindu women deserted by their husbands.
Under the Hindu Marriage Act, a Hindu cannot marry a second time
without divorcing his first wife.
The court's suggestion of a common civil code was welcomed by the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, the largest opposition party, which
demands that India revoke what it calls special privileges for Muslims
and other minorities.
Last week, the party said it would enforce a common code in four of 26
Indian states it rules _ Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and New Delhi.
Rao's statement, reported by Press Trust of India news agency, is seen
as an effort to win back Muslims' support as his splintered Congress
Party prepares for next year's general elections. Muslim support
appears to have fallen since Hindu radicals demolished an ancient
mosque in Ayodhya in December 1992.
