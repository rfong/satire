EU finance ministers welcome recovery, but remain cautious 
The prospects of European monetary union coming into force on schedule
have been boosted by economic recovery throughout Europe, a meeting of
European Union finance ministers here concluded Saturday.
"Many countries will be in a good position to comply with the (union)
criteria before the end of the century," said Germany's Finance
Minister Theo Waigel, who chaired the meeting.
The Maastricht Treaty, signed by the twelve in 1992, lays out the
framework for the setting up of a single EU currency for Europe by 1997
at the earliest, and 1999 at the latest.
The twelve's finance ministers welcomed their countries' return to
economic growth but said they were determined to combat bad European
economic structures and in particular, reduce their public deficits.
Despite the recovery, which experts predict will lead to a growth rate
of two percent across the European Union this year, problems remain.
"We must not conclude that all our structural problems are solved,"
said Luxembourg's Finance Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker.
He said economic development had vindicated the twelve's decision at
the time of the August 1993 crisis in the European Monetary System
(EMS), and that despite the enlargement at that time of the
exchange-rate mechanism bands from 2.25 percent to 15 percent,
currencies had remained very stable.
He was speaking on the fringes of the meeting, hosted by the Germans as
holders of the rotating EU presidency, in this town on the shores of
Lake Constance.
The European Commission has recently revised the provision for growth
in the Union's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) from 1.6 percent to two
percent for 1994, a figure reckoned to be realistic by Bundesbank
President Hans Tietmeyer.
But the rise in long-term interest rates in the financial markets
worries European officials, who said it could jeopardise the revival in
1995 by hindering investment.
The EU must send a "clear signal" to the financial markets, and try to
convince them that the revival will be used to consolidate budgetary
positions, said the European Economic and Finance Commissioner, Henning
Christophersen.
The rise in the long-term rate is generally considered a consequence of
the indebtedness of European countries, which have not experienced
current levels of debt since World War II. The markets indicate that
Europeans have slipped too far into debt during the recession,
according to Christophersen.
Meanwhile the President of the European Monetary Institute (EMI),
Alexandre Lamfalussy, informed ministers of the results of a study
carried out by his institution into the causes of rises in the
long-term rate.
The conclusions were comforting to politicians fighting inflation, and
highlight the necessity to accelerate the reduction in public debt,
Belgian Minister Philippe Maystadt said.
Running at less than three percent on average, inflation seems to be
under control in most European countries.
Finance ministers also discussed Saturday new means in which the
Maastricht Treaty can be used to stifle the deficits.
The Treaty puts in place from this year a procedure called "excessive
deficits", which allows the European Council of Ministers to send
letters of political and economic recommendation to countries whose
budgetary performance fail to correspond to the criteria laid down by
Maastricht.
These criteria for economic convergeance, which rest on deficits,
inflation, monetary stability, and interest rates, will determine the
selection of countries eligible to participate in the creation of
European monetary union by 1997 at the earliest, or 1999 at the latest.
