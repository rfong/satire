Ecologist Candidate Drops Out of Race 
Ecologist candidate Antoine Waechter formally bowed out of the
presidential race on Wednesday, unable to garner the 500 signatures of
elected officials needed to run.
His withdrawal leaves the ecologists with one candidate, Dominique
Voynet of the Greens party, who quickly appealed to Waechter's
followers to join her campaign.
Waechter was the second casualty of the 500-signature rule in less than
two weeks, narrowing the field of contenders to eight for the April 23
first-round vote. A runoff vote between the top two contenders will be
held May 7 to replace Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, ending
his second seven-year term.
Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, a conservative, is currently frontrunner,
followed by Premier Edouard Balladur, also a conservative, and
Socialist Lionel Jospin, contending for second place.
Jean-Francois Hory of the Radicals, a small leftist party, dropped out
of the race last week.
The ecologists have no real chance of making a mark in the contest.
Polls have shown each candidate with one percent or less of the vote.
Waechter has been the standard-bearer for ecologists since founding the
Greens party in 1984. But a split within the ranks in 1993 forced him
out. He then founded his own Movement of Independent Ecologists.
