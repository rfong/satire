Shanghai Strengthens Inspection on Imported Food, Animals And Plants
In 1999, the bureau inspected 2.57 million tons of imported food and
discovered 88,700 tons of sub-standard food, accounting for 3.45
percent of the total.
The bureau also stopped the imports of 23 shipments of food and 56
cases of French wine suspected of having been polluted.
Over the past 18 months, the bureau has also rooted out over 70 cases
involving nematodiasis, a plant disease endangering pine trees, from
wood packages imported from the United States, Japan and Canada.
As China's largest open port, Shanghai's annual import and export
volume accounts for one-fifth of the country's total.
