Deadline Set for Nations' Cup squads 
African Nations' Cup organisers said on Monday that the 16 qualifiers
for the finals in Ghana and Nigeria must name their squads by
Wednesday.
African Football Confederation (CAF) official Dr Viken Djizmedjian said
any team which fails to meet the deadline will be fined 3,000 dollars.
If the squad was not named by January 19, it would be cut by two
players to 20, added the official.
The Nations' Cup, which is being co-hosted for the first time in its
43-year history, kicks off in Accra on January 22 and ends on February
13 with the final at the National Stadium in Lagos.
