Netanyahu leaves for Washington 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left Wednesday for a five-day
trip to the United States, during which he will present US leaders with
his ideas for advancing peace efforts with the Palestinians and Syria,
officials said.
Netanyahu was accompanied by several advisors who were closely involved
in successful negotiations with the Palestinians over Israel's
withdrawal from Hebron and the release Tuesday of women Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails.
Officials said the Israelis would present President Bill Clinton and
his new foreign policy team built around Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen with the principles which
will guide Israel in upcoming negotiations on a final peace settlement
with the Palestinians.
Netanyahu will also bring new ideas for resuming peace negotiations
with Syria, which were suspended a year ago, the officials said.
During the visit, Netanyahu is also due to meet with Vice President Al
Gore, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, congressional leaders and
intelligence officials.
En route to Washington, the prime minster was scheduled to meet with
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok during a brief stopover in Amsterdam, his
office said.
Netanyahu cancelled a planned trip to the Netherlands, which currently
holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, last week after 73
Israeli soldiers were killed in an army helicopter collision.
