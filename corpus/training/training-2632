Balkan news agencies team up 
Representatives of seven Balkan news agencies agreed to pool their
resources in the region and form a central association, Bulgarian
agency BTA reported Saturday.
The new association "is born out of the necessity to unite our efforts
and corresponds to our wish to cooperate in the world of news," the
agency quoted the agreement as saying.
The new deal involves Bulgarian agencies BTA and the Balkan Information
Pool, Macedonian and Greek press agencies, Romania's Rompres agency,
Tanjung of Yugoslavia and the Turkish news agency Anatolia.
The association called on Balkan governments to facilitate their
journalists' passage in neighbouring countries, even to the extent of
dropping visa requirements.
The presidency of the association will rotate, and the venue for its
headquarters will be decided at a later meeting.
