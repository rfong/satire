Greece Reaffirms Commitment to "Hard Drachma" Policy 
Despite renewed speculative pressures on the Greek national currency
drachma in recent days, the Greek government reiterated today that it
would stick to the "hard drachma" policy.
Greek National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou said in
statements today that a stable drachma was "the cornerstone of our
economic policy." The government was determined to take all the
necessary measures to support it, he added.
The minister stressed that if necessary, he would increase interest
rates to support the exchange parity of drachma.
Greece's central bank, Bank of Greece, today intervened heavily in the
domestic interbank market to defend the drachma by reducing liquidity
and controlling a recent trend of capital outflows.
The Greek currency rebounded by 0.15 percent against the ecu and the
mark and recovered 0.10 percent against the U.S. dollar.
