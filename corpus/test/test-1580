Israelis hit Palestinians with F-16s after losing elite commander
The Israeli army, stung by the first-ever destruction of a crack battle
tank and the death of one of its elite commanders in the West Bank, hit
back hard killing a Palestinian policeman and wounding 30 people in F-16
strikes on the northern Gaza Strip.
Israeli tanks Saturday re-entered al-Maghazi refugee camp, in the
central Gaza Strip, for the third time this week and invaded the
village of Juhu al-Dik, to the north, Palestinian security sources told
AFP.
They later moved into the northern village of Hai al-Zeitun, destroying
the military intelligence headquarters there, Palestinian security
sources said.
Keeping pressure up from the other side, a Palestinian Qassam-2 rocket
struck near the Kfar Azza kibbutz in southern Israel Saturday morning,
causing no casualties but some property damage, an Israeli army
spokesman said.
Israeli military sources said Lieutenant Colonel Eyal Weiss, 34, head
of the elite Duvdevan undercover unit, died when a wall damaged by
Israeli forces collapsed on him in the village of Saida, near Tulkarem
in the northern West Bank.
But the radical Islamic Jihad group said its military arm, the Al-Qods
Brigades, killed Weiss during a dawn Israeli incursion Friday in Saida
to hunt for militants.
The group said one of its members, Anwar Abdel Ghani, was "liquidated"
by the army during the operation, adding that Weiss's killing will show
"the leaders of the criminal enemy that their invasion of our cities
and villages will not be a pleasant journey."
Israeli warplanes later raided the Jabaliya refugee camp in the
northern Gaza, firing three rockets on the public security
headquarters.
Palestinian security officer Abdel-Salam Yunis was found dead under the
rubble and 30 others, civilians and policemen, were wounded in the
strike.
The deaths brought to 1,208 the number of people killed in the
16-month-old intifada, or Palestinian uprising, including 924
Palestinians and 262 Israelis.
The air strikes came less than a day after three crewmen of an Israeli
Merkava tank were killed and a fourth was when it was blown up in the
Gaza Strip on its way to the scene of an earlier blast.
The Al-Nasser Saladin Group, linked to the Popular Resistance
Committees in Palestine, claimed the attack as a reprisal for Israel's
killing of five Palestinian policemen earlier in the week.
Israeli forces had kept up the pressure in the Gaza Strip throughout
the day, sending tanks and troops back into the town of Beit Hanoun,
which they had occupied on Wednesday.
Tanks, armoured bulldozers and jeeps also rolled into several other
towns, including a civilian area south of Gaza City where they
destroyed several houses and farmland.
In signs of growing tension among Palestinians, meanwhile, hundreds of
angry people hurled stones at the offices of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
The demonstrators, claiming to represent two radical Palestinian groups
and asking for the release of detained militants, were kept back by
riot police.
The violence has dealt another blow to the European Union's latest
peace efforts.
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and his German counterpart,
Joschka Fischer, both visited the region this week.
Fischer, speaking at a joint press conference with Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres Friday, said "the terror must be stopped, and we
must find ways back to the negotiating table."
He also backed a plan concocted by Peres and Palestinian parliamentary
head Ahmed Qorei.
For his part, Peres said the latest peace plan did not contradict the
earlier Mitchell or Tenet agreements but supplemented them, "because it
says that if the Palestinians will put their house in order, then in a
short while we can have mutual recognition.
"But then within a year, we can try to deal with outstanding issues
such as permanent borders. The value is that it has two sides, but you
cannot walk with one leg and you cannot make peace with one side. These
are issues for couples."
Meanwhile, countering US- and British-backed Israeli efforts to step up
the pressure on Arafat, France and Russia urged the Jewish state to
lift its blockade on the Palestinian leader, who has been confined by
the army to his West Bank headquarters since December 3.
Israel "should re-establish the chairman of the Palestinian Authority's
freedom of movement," said a statement issued in Paris and agreed by
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and his French counterpart, Hubert
Vedrine.
In Cairo, the official Egyptian press centre said US Central
Intelligence Agency chief George Tenet was expected in Egypt Saturday
for talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the situation in the
Palestinian territories.
Tenet brokered a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Palestinians in
June 2001 as a first step toward resuming peace talks under the
Mitchell plan, but it never took hold on the ground.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher is due to travel to the United
States in March ahead of Mubarak's visit the same month, foreign
ministry sources said.
