``/`` Agriculture/NNP must/MD be/VB given/VBN a/DT pride/NN of/IN place/NN and/CC we/PRP must/MD have/VB consistent/JJ policies/NNS to/TO boost/VB agricultural/JJ production/NN and/CC local/JJ manufacturing/NN ,/, ''/'' Obasanjo/NNP said/VBD ./.

He/PRP pointed/VBD out/RP that/IN some/DT countries/NNS that/WDT have/VBP no/DT natural/JJ resources/NNS have/VBP done/VBN better/RBR than/IN Nigeria/NNP because/IN they/PRP have/VBP good/JJ managers/NNS ,/, skills/NNS and/CC technology/NN ./.

``/`` This/DT is/VBZ a/DT country/NN that/WDT should/MD be/VB flowing/VBG with/IN milk/NN and/CC honey/NN but/CC we/PRP are/VBP poor/JJ today/NN because/IN we/PRP have/VBP mismanaged/VBN our/PRP$ resources/NNS ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT things/NNS we/PRP did/VBD in/IN the/DT past/NN was/VBD to/TO throw/VB money/NN at/IN our/PRP$ problems/NNS rather/RB than/IN working/VBG out/RP real/JJ solutions/NNS ,/, ''/'' the/DT president/NN said/VBD ./.

He/PRP called/VBD on/IN his/PRP$ countrymen/NNS to/TO join/VB hands/NNS to/TO make/VB the/DT country/NN a/DT better/JJR place/NN politically/NN ,/, economically/RB and/CC socially/RB ./.

The/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS Food/NNP and/CC Agricultural/NNP Organization/NNP estimated/VBD that/IN in/IN order/NN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT negative/JJ affection/NN imposed/VBN by/IN the/DT long/JJ -/: term/NN negligence/NN of/IN the/DT agricultural/JJ sector/NN ,/, the/DT Nigerian/NNP government/NN should/MD be/VB progressively/RB moved/VBN toward/IN 25/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT budget/NN by/IN 2010/CD ./.

Agriculture/NNP was/VBD widely/RB practiced/JJ in/IN Nigeria/NNP during/IN the/DT 1950s/NNS and/CC the/DT 1960s/NNS ,/, when/WRB about/RB 90/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT West/NNP African/NNP country/NN 's/POS population/NN was/VBD involved/VBN in/IN agriculture/NN ./.
