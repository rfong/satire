Rangers striker injury fears
Rangers striker Sebastian Rozental fears his first season in Scottish
football is over after just 58 minutes.
The Chilean, who cost Rangers four million pounds two months ago, may
need an operation on a damaged knee after breaking down in training.
"I feel very bad about this because I came to Scotland to help Rangers
win trophies now it seems as if I will have to wait a little while
longer," the 20-year-old said.
He played one half of a Scottish Cup victory over St Johnstone in
January and the last 13 minutes of a Premier League game at Motherwell.
The Chilean international underwent an exploratory operation on Tuesday
night.
Manager Walter Smith said: "We have to wait and see the results of the
scope operation performed on Sebastian, and depending on that we might
have to send him to the United States for surgery."
