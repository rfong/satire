Karzai in Tokyo to drum up funds, more al-Qaeda suspects held
Offers of cash for Afghanistan's fragile new interim regime were piling
up Sunday ahead of a major international donors' conference here while
suspected al-Qaeda militants were piling up in the world's jails.
Pakistani security officials said seven suspected followers of chief
terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden had been picked up near the Afghan
border were being interrogated by US intelligence officials.
Photographs of al-Qaeda suspects in chains, blindfolds, ear-muffs and
mittens sparked renewed controversy over the treatment of prisoners at
a US naval base in Cuba, causing US ally Britain to request information
on the circumstances in which the pictures were taken.
The US war against al-Qaeda gained pace in the Philippines, where more
troops arrived to help local forces crush Muslim rebels, but suffered a
minor setback in Afghanistan, where two US Marines were killed in a
helicopter crash.
Afghanistan's interim leader Hamid Karzai said on his arrival in Tokyo
one day ahead of a two-day donors' conference that he hoped to return
to his war-torn homeland with a good slice of the money he will need to
rebuild it.
He was buoyed by early announcements of cash donations, the first steps
towards the 1.7 billion dollars (1.9 billion euros) the World Bank
estimates he will need in his first year, and the 15 billion needed
over the coming decade.
Karzai arrived in Tokyo from Saudi Arabia, where he reportedly was
promised 20 million dollars.
More significantly, Japan is to send up to 500 million dollars over the
next two-and-a-half years, the Jiji news agency reported.
The German government said in Berlin it would release 283 million
dollars (320 million euros) over the next fours years, and a senior US
official said in Tokyo that the United States was ready with a
"substantial" commitment.
"I'm hoping very much that I'll go back to my country, to my people,
with full hands," Karzai said.
Some 54 countries and 18 non-governmental agencies will be represented
at the two-day conference starting Monday to discuss Afghanistan's
needs in the wake of the overthrow of the Taliban regime.
Meanwhile around the world, police, spy agencies and military forces
were in tracking down members of bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, which
has been blamed for the September 11 attacks on US cities last year.
Pakistani security officials said seven suspects -- a British Arab, a
Saudi, a Yemeni, two Afghans and two Pakistanis -- were being
interrogated by a joint team of Pakistani and US agencies at a secure
detention centre outside Lahore.
A police official told AFP the men had admitted being al-Qaeda members.
Afghan police working for Karzai's interim government arrested six
alleged al-Qaeda members late Friday, and on Saturday Spanish police
arrested two more suspects near the Catalan city of Barcelona.
The latest arrests in Spain came just days after British anti-terrorist
police arrested 17 people linked to what they said was an al-Qaeda cell
based in the central English city of Leicester.
Other arrests have taken place in the United States, Europe and
Southeast Asia after the US-led "war on terrorism" inspired an
unprecedented bout of co-operation between intelligence and law
enforcement agencies.
Some 110 suspected al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters captured in
Afghanistan have been transferred to the US naval base in Cuba's
Guantanamo Bay, where they are being held as "unlawful combattants" in
a high-security compound.
The treatment of these prisoners, who are being held in open air cells
and were transported in chains and whose legal status is in limbo after
Washington refused to recognize them as prisoners of war, has triggered
protests from international human rights groups.
Pictures taken at the jail by a US navy officer and released to the
media show a group of prisoners, suspected members of bin Laden's
al-Qaeda network, kneeling in orange jump suits and manacled at the
waist.
They are wearing dark goggles to blot out the light, ear muffs to keep
out sound and mittens.
Three of the prisoners are British, and Home Secretary Jack Straw said
Britain was seeking information from the United States about the
circumstances in which photographs of the detainees were taken.
"The British government's position is that prisoners, regardless of
their technical status, should be treated humanely and in accordance
with customary international law," Straw said in a statement.
"We have always made that clear and the Americans have said they share
this view."
US officials have insisted the prisoners are receiving humane
treatment.
The best known of the prisoners taken in Afghanistan, 20-year-old John
Walker US citizen who volunteered to fight for the Taliban and was
captured by opposition forces, will soon be brought to America to face
trial in a civilian court, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
Hundreds of US troops are still in Afghanistan trying to root out bin
Laden supporters amid conflicting reports of his fate.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has said the 44-year-old veteran
of the US-backed war against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan might
have died from kidney failure. Other reports suggest he has fled
Afghanistan.
Karzai said Sunday: "I don't know whether he is dead or not. Every
country is searching for him."
US Secretary of State Colin Powell dismissed Musharraf's idea as
"speculation" and both he and Rumsfeld said that the hunt for bin Laden
was continuing.
The latest arrests in Spain came just days after British anti-terrorist
police arrested 17 people linked to what they said was an al-Qaeda cell
based in the central English city of Leicester.
A US Marine CH-53E Super Stallion heavy-lift helicopter carrying seven
people crashed 30 minutes after leaving an airbase in Bagram, 50
kilometres (30 miles) north of Kabul on a mission to resupply troops.
"There were seven Marines on board, two were killed and five were
injured," Captain Tom Bryant told reporters at Bagram.
"All five are stable, but two are in a critical condition, two in a
serious condition and one has minimal injuries," he said.
Rumsfeld said the cause of the crash appeared to be mechanical failure.
More US military aircraft arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, where
three C-130 Hercules transport planes arrived from a base in Okinawa,
Japan, bringing supplies for 650 US soldiers taking part as "advisers"
in a six-month joint campaign with Filipino troops, military officials
said.
The cargo included military vehicles, a forklift, an earthmover,
communication equipment, and about two dozen US soldiers.
The two governments say the troops, the largest overseas deployment of
US soldiers since the start of the Afghan campaign, would advise their
Filipino counterparts in a campaign to crush the Abu Sayyaf guerrilla
group.
Abu Sayyaf is said to have links with al-Qaeda and the group is holding
two US hostages.
