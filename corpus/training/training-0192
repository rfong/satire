Pakistan Imposes 25-Percent Duty on Sugar Import 
The Pakistani government has imposed a 25-percent additional regulatory
duty on the import of sugar to protect the local industry and
discourage its import.
The imposition has boosted the rate of regulatory duty on import sugar
from 10 percent to 35 percent.
However, the total duty levied on the import of sugar will now be 45
percent, which includes a 10-percent customs duty, sources from the
Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet said Friday.
The decision to impose additional regulatory duty on the import of
sugar was made Thursday during an ECC meeting chaired by Finance
Minister Ishaq Dar.
The ECC believed that it was necessary to protect the local sugar
industry and discourage the import of sugar as its prices in the
international market had started declining.
