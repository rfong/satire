Four-Month Hostage Crisis Ends in Lima 
Peruvian armed forces stormed the residence of Japanese ambassador in
Lima this afternoon, ending a four-month-long hostage crisis.
Sound of gunfire and explosions were heard at 15:20 hours and smoke
could be seen inside the residence of Japanese Ambassador Morihisa
Aoki.
Local media reports said that one of the 72 hostages, Supreme Court
Judge Carlos Giusti, was killed.
But Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said all the hostages were
safe, reports said.
The assault killed all of the roughly 15 Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
(MRTA) guerrillas, who stormed the ambassador's residence during a
cocktail party on December 17 and held more than 500 guests there
hostage, reports said.
