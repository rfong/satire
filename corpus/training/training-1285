Russia Opposes Terrorist Pressure on Macedonia 
Moscow opposes imposing any resolution on Macedonia concerning its
internal affairs, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Thursday.
No decisions can be forced on the government of Macedonia " under the
pressure of terrorist forces" for the sake of the solution of internal
problems, Ivanov said at a press conference here.
"Russia is very concerned about" the developments in Macedonia, the
minister stressed. Moscow thinks that "all necessary assistance must be
given to the democratic and legitimate government of Macedonia to solve
the internal problems it faces."
Macedonia "has the constitution and the legitimate government to find a
lawful solution to its internal problems," and other countries have no
right to intervene in its internal affairs, he said.
