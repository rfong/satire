Chinese Workers Learn New Skills 
Providing educational opportunities for its workers has become a major
goal for one of China's leading automobile manufacturers.
More than 60,000 young employees in the No. 1 Automobile Group Company
in Changchun, the capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, are
enrolled in a variety of education and training programs to improve
their general knowledge and learn more skills.
Dong Qijun, a 20-year-old worker who has attended five different
training classes, is studying German and preparing for the entrance
examination of an amateur university.
Some 30,000 of the company's workers recently graduated from a
television education school after completing the final examination,
held in both Changchun and Jilin.
The 43-year-old company produces 360,000 automobiles annually. With an
investment of 10.7 billion yuan, the company has set up a hi-tech base
that will manufacture 150,000 buses or cars per year.
The young workers are eager to learn new skills and advanced
techniques, because the booming business involves 400 specialities and
260 work procedures in the course of production.
A survey showed that 90 percent of young workers in the company want
additional education.
The workers spend most of their spare time attending classes in the 21
training networks established by the company in recent years.
At the same time, the company's administrative staff are required to
pass examinations in computer science, a foreign language,
administration and automobile techniques.
Half of the young workers have received at least three kinds of
professional education training, and many of them play leading roles in
production.
