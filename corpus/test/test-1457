U.N. Oil-For-Food Deal Fails to Meet Basic Needs: Iraq 
The United Nations oil-for-food program has failed to meet the basic
humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad
Mehdi Salah said here on Wednesday.
Salah made the remark while meeting a visiting Egyptian delegation,
which arrived in Baghdad by plane on Tuesday afternoon.
Salah said that Iraq's oil exports have generated some 35 billion U.S.
dollars since the beginning of the U.N. humanitarian deal in December
1996, yet only 8.3 billion dollars worth of goods arrived in Iraq, or
an average of 2 billion dollars a year and seven dollars for every
Iraqi citizen.
In contrast, some 11.5 billion dollars have been spent to cover the
expenses of U.N. activities and reparations stemming from the 1991 Gulf
War, he said.
Meanwhile, Salah expressed Iraq's keenness to develop trade ties with
Egypt, Iraq's fourth largest trading partner. Iraq has imported goods
worth 1 billion dollars from Egypt since the oil- for-food deal was
implemented.
The U.N. humanitarian program, now in its eighth phase, allows Iraq to
sell unlimited amount of oil to buy humanitarian supplies to ease the
crippling impacts of sanctions imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The sanctions will not be lifted unless U.N. arms experts declare that
Iraq is free of all weapons of mass destruction.
Egypt has been one of the leading Arab countries calling for lifting
the decade-old sanctions.
The visiting Egyptian delegation came to Iraq by plane to show its
solidarity with Iraq as well as its defiance of the air embargo, which
Iraq claimed is unilaterally imposed by the United States and Britain.
The U.S. and Britain maintain that the U.N. sanctions cover air embargo
and flights to or from Iraq should be first approved by the U.N.
Sanctions Committee.
So far, two Egyptian planes have landed in Iraq since Iraq's Saddam
International Airport was reopened on August 17, joining a growing list
of foreign flights to Baghdad with only prior notifications to the U.N.
committee.
