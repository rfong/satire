On Friday's evidence, Graf, bidding for a fifth consecutive Grand Slam
title, will need to raise her game.
Her 6-0, 4-6, 6-2 victory over plucky 83rd-ranked Joanette Kruger of
South Africa, was by no means easy.
"I certainly wasn't happy with the way I played today -- but it was
good for me to have that kind of match," said Graf, adding: "There are
a lot of things I have to improve."
Twelfth-seeded Pierce, who is expected to face Graf in a potentially
explosive semi-final, didn't drop a game and needed just 58 minutes to
brush aside experienced Lori McNeil of the United States.
Pierce, whose game and temperament have blossomed under the wing of new
coach Nick Bollettieri, has so far conceded only two games since the
tournament began.
Other newcomers to reach the last sixteen were Croatian teenager Iva
Majoli, Spirlea's compatriot Ruxandra Dragomir, Petra Ritter of Austria
and Amanda Coetzer of South Africa.
Austria's eleventh-seeded Thomas Muster, who put twice-finalist Andre
Agassi out of the event in the previous round, tried every trick in the
book -- including spitting at his opponent and rubbing the balls on the
clay surface to slow them down -- to upset Rafter. But he nevertheless
went down 4-6, 7-5, 3-6, 3-6.
The sight of Muster rubbing the balls on the ground, left the
21-year-old Australian Davis Cup player bemused.
"I thought 'he's tampering with the balls. I had a good look at them
but I didn't bring it up with the umpire because I didn't want to get
distracted."
Muster said: "I did it to slow them down. We had a soft ball and it had
to be replaced. He used it five times in a row when all the other balls
were three games old. That's not very sporting either."
Despite some obscene outbursts on court, which were the equal of those
that cost Agassi a penalty point on Tuesday but went unpunished, Muster
was gracious about his opponent.
"He played his game very well and forced me to make good returns and I
didn't makes those today."
Tillstrom, a left-hander who has never featured in the world's top-100
and who is currently down at 226th on the ATP computer, continued his
remarkable run by beating the big-serving 6ft 5in (1m 96) Krajicek 7-6
(7/4) 6-2, 6-3.
The Gothenburg's highest-ever ranking was 117th -- achieved two years
ago.
Krajicek, who reached the semi-finals here twelve months ago, won his
fifth career title at Barcelona this season after several months
absence because of tendinitis of the knee.
