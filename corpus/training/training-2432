Shipwrecks leave at least 26 missing 
At least 26 people were reported missing Thursday after two cargo ships
capsized overnight off the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta, a
rescue official told AFP.
Teodor Voicu said the ships, one from Malta and the other from Hong
Kong, capsized Wednesday evening in high winds and seas after hitting a
wall protecting the entrance of the harbour.
He said the vessel from Hong Kong, the You Xiu, had "26 or 27 crew
members on board whose fate is unknown". It was not clear how many
people were on board the Maltese ship, the Paris, and what the
nationalities of both crews were.
Rescue boats and divers tried all night to approach the 20,000-tonne
boats which finally capsized. They had been on their way into the port
to take chemical products aboard.
"The rescuers could not approach the two boats because they ran the
risk of hitting the harbour wall themselves," Voicu said.
The Romanian ministry of transport said the harbour-master had issued
warnings for both ships not to approach the port but the message
apparently was ignored.
