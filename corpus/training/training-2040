Rebel ADF Commander Arrested in W. Uganda 
A senior commander of rebel Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) has been
seized in western Uganda, a report reaching here said today.
The commander, identified as Haruna Kasirye, is the chief of an ADF
mobile unit deployed on Rwenzori mountains in Kasese District in charge
of transporting drugs for the group, the "New Vision" quoted military
sources as saying.
Kasirye, who joined ADF in mid 1996, was arrested on Saturday with four
other ADF rebels together, said the press.
ADF's bases in the region were reportedly destroyed in a two-week
mopping-up operation by the army of the Ugandan government in late
December and early January.
Some ADF remnants fled westward into deeper mountains in the
Ugandan-Zairean border area, said the press.
