US-Russia talks on NATO
Moscow says differences persist
Russia on Monday said differences persist with NATO over Moscow's future
relations with an expanded alliance even if the tone remains upbeat after a
first round of talks Sunday.
A statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, quoted by Intefax news
agency, said there was "positive work" accomplished Sunday at a meeting
between NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
The talks, at a secret location here, are to resolve Moscow's concern
for its national security in view of an enlarged NATO. Russia has been
demanding a binding guarantee from NATO.
"We have discussed NATO's response to proposals that Russia has made,"
prior to Solana's visit. "Differences persist on a series of problems,"
the foreign ministry statement said.
