Israeli Christian convert appeals against military service 
An Israeli who converted to Christianity appealed to the supreme court
on Sunday to free him from military service as a conscientious
objector, legal officials said.
Guideon Davidov, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union, has been in
a military prison for a month after refusing to serve the statutory
three years of military service.
The Jewish state does not recognise the status of conscientious
objector.
Davidov, who became a Protestant Christian after settling in Israel, is
basing his appeal on the fact that Orthodox Jews who study in religious
colleges are exempt from military service on request, along with Arab
Moslems and Christians.
"He who lives by the sword dies by the sword," Davidov told the court,
quoting the Gospels.
