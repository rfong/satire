Zimbabwe Releases 4,000 Prisoners 
Nearly 4,000 prisoners in Zimbabwe have so far been released under an
amnesty to ease congestion in the country's jails, The Herald newspaper
reported Saturday.
Government and Prison Service officials Friday confirmed that about
4,000 prisoners had been released since last Saturday following
President Robert Mugabe's proclamation of the clemency order in a
government Gazette last Friday.
More will be freed in batches under an exercise to be staggered over
two years to reduce the prison population.
Until the release of the 4,000 convicts, there were 22,500 prisoners in
Zimbabwe whereas the country's prisons can accommodate only 16,000
inmates.
"Between 3,000 and 4,000 have already been released so far under the
exercise which is an on-going exercise," said Justice, Legal and
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Patrick Chinamasa.
Police Public Relations Officer Frank Meki confirmed that the exercise
to lessen the burden on resources in jails has begun since last
Saturday.
Four categories of prisoners are benefiting from the pardon- women
convicted of infanticide, abortion, baby dumping and concealment of
birth, breastfeeding women, prisoners sentenced to two years and below
for petty crimes and those serving determinate sentences.
The clemency followed a Cabinet recommendation to reduce the prison
population that is stretching limited resources.
