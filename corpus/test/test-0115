One civilian dead, six wounded in Turkish air raid, Kurds say 
Turkish warplanes killed a six-year-old Kurdish girl and wounded six
civilians when they bombed a mountain village during an offensive
against the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), villagers said Sunday.
Residents of Pilingan, 30 kilometres (19 miles) south of the
Turkey-Iraq border, said a dozen Turkish warplanes had bombed the
village at least 20 times since they began their offensive last Monday.
A child called Naranch died in one raid and six other people were
injured on the first day of the operation, they said.
"Naranch was playing at the river when the airplanes came and started
to bomb. We called her to come into the house but she had already been
hit by a bomb," said her 11-year-old sister Hemin.
Some homes were damaged by bombs but "we were lucky, the Turks didn't
hit well," said Mustapha Mohammad, a teacher. "Most of the bombs landed
in the river or on fields."
He pointed out craters two metres (yards) wide.
Another Pilingan resident, Ahmad Sherif, said: "They bombed us because
the PKK have a camp not far from here."
The village lies in a rocky valley in northeastern Iraq, 20 kilometres
(12 miles) from the small town of Raniya.
Turkey poured 35,000 troops backed by armour and warplanes into
northern Iraq to wipe out PKK bases last Monday.
Ankara has pledged not to harm Iraqi Kurds and Turkish commanders say
their bombardments of targets identified as PKK camps have not caused
any civilian casualties.
However the Iraqi National Congress, an umbrella of opposition groups
based in northern Iraq, said one Iraqi Kurdish civilian died and two
were wounded in bombing raids on Kashan, a village near Zakho.
Pilingan villagers said they had no plans to flee their homes. "Where
should we go? Here is our homeland," said 57-year-old Suabin Mohammad.
