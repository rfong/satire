India's Steel Consumption Growth Rate Falls 
The growth rate of India's steel consumption has slowed down in the
first quarter of this fiscal year, official sources said here today.
Finished steel consumption has grown by 6.2 percent in the first
quarter of 1995-96, as per provisional estimates of the Steel Ministry.
This represents a fall of 13.8 percent compared to a 20 percent growth
rate in first quarter of 1994-95.
the sharp increase of 20 percent in steel consumption in 1994-95 came
after three years of recession, namely from 1991-92 to 1993-94. Since
1994-95 consumption growth was really a recovery from a low base, the
rate of growth was bound to dip to normal levels in 1995-96, the same
sources said.
Steel industry analysts said, however, the dip started a little earlier
than expected. they had expected a high rate of steel demand growth for
another year.
Other indicators for the first quarter of 1995-96 supporting a fall in
rate of growth of steel demand are: finished steel imports have fallen
by five percent. Finished steel stocks have gone up by 179,000 tons, 20
percent more than the increase in stocks in the first quarter of the
previous fiscal.
