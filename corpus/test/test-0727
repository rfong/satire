Karzai fine-tunes cabinet after Loya Jirga approves key posts
New Afghan president Hamid Kazai was fine-tuning his cabinet on
Thursday after a delicate balancing act that enabled him to win
approval for his key ministers at the end of Afghanistan's Loya Jirga
grand assembly.
Karzai won overwhelming approval on Wednesday from Loya Jirga delegates
for his key ministers at the end of the nine-day assembly, which ended
with his swearing-in as president of an 18-month transitional
administration.
Ethnic Tajiks Mohammad Qasim Fahim and Abdullah Abdullah kept their
respective powerful posts as defence and foreign affairs minister.
But Karzai handed the interior and finance portfolios to fellow
Pashtuns Taj Mohammad Wardak and Ashraf Ghani to satisfy ethnic
demands.
Outgoing interior minister Yunus Qanooni, also an ethnic Tajik, was
given the education brief, while the governor of eastern Nangarhar
province, Haji Qadir, and ethnic Hazara leader Karim Khalili were named
deputy presidents along with Fahim.
Health Minister Suheila Sidiq, Afghanistan's only woman general, kept
her job.
There was no seat in the cabinet for Uzbek warlord and current deputy
defence minister Abdul Rashid Dostam or the self-styled Emir of Herat
Ismael Khan. But Dostam associate's Mohammad Alam Razim was named
minister for small industry.
Karzai told Thursday's edition of British newspaper The Times he had
offered seats to all Afghanistan's main warlords in an effort to
encourage nation-building rather than regional fiefdoms.
"I offered positions to all of them," he told The Times. "Nobody can be
a vice president (and stay) in the provinces ... (but) I could not
afford the ministries they wanted.
"My offer to them was we must come and build a nation together. We must
exercise nation-building not region building."
A weary-looking Karzai also defended his decision to extend Fahim's
defence mandate despite suggestions that the marshal's large personal
army make him a potential risk to stability.
"He's the minister of defence," Karzai said. "We have an anti-terrorism
campaign to complete. We cannot turn things upside down and change
things round overnight.
"We have to build on things we have. We cannot begin a revolution."
Karzai has announced a total of 14 cabinet ministers and is expected to
complete the appointments over the next few days. He has said he would
reduce the number of ministries from the present 29, without specifying
a new figure.
He rejected criticism that the Loya Jirga had had no say in the cabinet
make-up.
"There was debate," he insisted. "I told them: Do you agree? And they
said yes. How many debates do we want?"
But althought Karzai won a convincing show of hands at the Loya Jirga,
he did not manage to satisfy everyone present.
"I hope the cabinet works and solves all the problems for the sake of
Afghanistan but I regret that it's note but Hamid Karzai will have to
work hard to fulfil the promises he has made."
Sultan Ahmad Bahim, the head of the official Bakhter news agency and a
Loya Jirga delegate, said although the new cabinet had greater balance,
the Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance, which ousted the former Taliban
regime with the help of US forces, still wielded undue clout.
"There are representatives of all ethnic groups in this list but the
ethnic balance has not been observed perfectly.
"The forces of the Northern Alliance have got more posts (than any
other group) due to their military strength," said Bahim.
US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said: "My understanding is that it's more
ethnically balanced than the previous administration.
"We wish them success but ... we will have to see if they can work
together and push their programmes forward."
