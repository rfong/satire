Knight: Coles Should Go 
Sydney Olympics chief Michael Knight said Saturday a fresh
investigation of Australian International Olympic Committee (IOC)
member Phil Coles signaled it was time for the former Olympian to
resign.
Knight, president of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic
Games (SOCOG), said the IOC's decision to launch an inquiry into
whether Coles accepted a gift of expensive jewelry in contravention of
IOC guidelines should trigger his departure from the SOCOG board.
"The IOC have started some processes. I don't think Phil should wait
for the conclusion of those processes. I think he should walk, " Knight
said in Sydney. Knight cannot dismiss Coles from the SOCOG board
because his IOC membership gives him an automatic place there.
Other SOCOG members urging Coles to step down include chief executive
Sandy Hollway, who said the continuing presence of Coles on the SOCOG
board jeopardized efforts to raise the remaining 228 million Australian
dollars (141 million U.S. dollars) of the target budget for the Games.
Coles claims he has no knowledge of jewelry that Georgina Coles, his
former wife, had been photographed wearing at an IOC function in Tokyo.
Georgina Coles sparked the fresh inquiry by faxing a letter to the IOC
confirming that the heavy gold and diamond pieces were a gift from a
businessman linked to Athens' bid for the Olympics 10 years ago.
