Financial secretary Tsang said Hong Kong wanted to work together with
Singapore and other economies in the region to develop the services
industry in the East Asian region.
By 2000, the share of the services sector in gross domestic product for
the region is projected to rise to 58 percent, corresponding to a
value-added contribution of over five trillion US dollars, he said.
"This projection has not taken into account a number of ongoing efforts
which inevitably will boost demand for services and, more importantly,
encourage the flow of service trade across national boundaries on a
scale never seen before in modern times," he said.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten in an interview published
here Friday urged the territory's people to speak up for their
political and economic autonomy in the run-up to the Chinese takeover.
Patten told Singapore's Straits Times that he was confident Hong Kong
would remain "a great society" under Chinese rule, and that its
people's "civic consciousness" would survive any dismantling of its
current institutions.
