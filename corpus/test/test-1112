Singapore, Indian Navies Conducting Joint Exercise 
Two Indian and two Singapore ships on Thursday began a seven-day naval
exercise off the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean, the third such
drill by the two countries.
The exercise aims to ``promote professional interaction and ... enhance
bilateral ties between the two navies,'' a Singapore navy statement
said.
The participating ships -- Kursura and Dunagiri from India and
Singapore's Valour and Vigilance -- will stop at Port Blair in the
Andaman Islands for sporting activities after the exercise ends on Jan.
18, the statement said.
The Andaman Islands are the most eastern territory of India, located
about 1,400 kilometers (880 miles) from the mainland.
The first such exercise was held in February 1993, the statement said.
