King Sihanouk sends condolences to Kennedy family 
Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk has sent a warm message of condolence
to the family of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, praising the former US
first lady as a faithful friend of his country.
"On this sad occasion, we extend our deep and heartfelt condolences,"
King Sihanouk said in a message Friday following Onassis's death at her
New York home from cancer, aged 64.
The king said that he and his wife were "greatly saddened" by the death
of Onassis, widow of former US president John Kennedy, who was
assassinated in Dallas in November 1963.
"We will always venerate the illustrous and much-loved memory of Madame
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, a great lady of whom the American people
are justly proud and a great and faithful friend of the Cambodian
people and ourselves," the message, sent to AFP on Saturday, said.
The 71-year-old king arrived in Beijing on Wednesday to resume medical
treatment for cancer.
"All our lives, we will cherish the memory of her faithfulness and
friendship for us," he said of Onassis, who visited to Cambodia in
1967.
