Philippine Official on Development of Natural Gas 
The prospects are good for the development of natural gas in the
Philippines as an alternative source of energy, a senior official said
here Saturday.
Secretary Mario Tiaoqui of the Department of Energy (DOE) said in a
radio interview: "Our oil reserves are rather low. But we have an
abundant supply of natural gas."
Tiaoqui said that the government and some private firms are now
developing natural gas as a new source of energy, and expect to start
making full use of it by year 2001.
"We can start harnessing our natural gas resource in 2001. It is now
being developed, with pipelines being laid from Palawan to Batangas (in
the southwestern Philippines)," he said.
Earlier, President Joseph Estrada said that his administration is
developing natural gas as a major energy source to substantially reduce
the country's dependence on imported oil.
Estrada said the government, which is now constructing gas wells in
Palawan, expects to start using this source of energy in three years.
As of last year, Tiaoqui said, the country got 75 percent of its energy
production from oil.
Thus, he said, the government is working to reduce its dependency on
oil.
"By the year 2004 we expect that to go down to 25 percent," he said,
adding the Philippines by that time would be using hydroelectric, coal
and geothermal energy as well.
