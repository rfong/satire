IPU Stresses Food Security in Underdeveloped Countries 
The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Wednesday emphasized the priority
of securing food supplies in underdeveloped countries at a special
meeting here.
The meeting, jointly organized by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), Italian parliament and IPU, was aimed
at facilitating the attainment, through sustainable development, of the
objectives as set by the World Food Summit of 1997.
In the final document of the meeting, the IPU recommended ways for
resolving the world's food supply problems, including harmonization of
relevant laws of different countries, convocation of a conference on
world food security once a year, and coordination among U.N.
organizations.
About 270 parliamentarians from 70 countries attended the four-day
meeting, which ended Wednesday.
