The/DT defense/NN enabled/VBD the/DT Oilers/NNPS to/TO build/VB a/DT 20-3/JJ lead/NN going/VBG into/IN the/DT fourth/JJ quarter/NN ,/, but/CC rookie/NN Corey/NNP Sawyer/NNP 's/POS 82-yard/JJ punt/NN return/NN for/IN a/DT touchdown/NN and/CC a/DT 49-yard/JJ field/NN goal/NN by/IN Doug/NNP Pelfrey/NNP put/VBD the/DT Bengals/NNPS back/RB into/IN the/DT game/NN ./.

After/IN missing/VBG 2Â 1\/2/CD games/NNS because/RB of/IN a/DT shoulder/NN separation/NN ,/, Carlson/NNP struggled/VBD to/TO find/VB his/PRP$ receivers/NNS and/CC suffered/VBD a/DT broken/JJ nose/NN when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD hit/VBN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN a/DT running/JJ play/NN ./.
