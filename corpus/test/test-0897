Commentary: Which School Mandates Do We Boot? 
As the election approaches you will be assaulted with numbers. Which
candidate for governor is leading in the polls? Which candidate has the
most contributions?
Disregard. Discard. Ignore. Erase.
But here's one number that matters in the governor's race: 22.
Actually it's 1-22. It's the state-mandated teacher-student ratio for
pre-kindergarten through grade four. Of the volumes of reforms that
came out of the 1980s, it's the most important.
A lot of what the Legislature approved 10 years ago has gone by the
wayside, but 1-22 survives. Will it survive Nov. 8?
Both George W. Bush and Ann Richards say they are for reducing state
control over schools. They differ, however, in the degree to which they
would lift regulations.
Bush supports home-rule districts, under which districts would vote
themselves independent of the Legislature except for financing,
guarantees of basic constitutional rights such as safety, and testing
to make sure their students are learning something.
Richards has ordered a revision of Texas Education Agency rules to
remove ``the boot'' of the state from the neck of school districts.
What about 1-22? That's one requirement Richards is flatly opposed to
lifting, except on a case-by-case basis. Under Bush's proposal,
class-size ratios would be out the door subject to district approval.
Other state requirements Richards would leave intact would be teacher
salary standards, teacher certification and the ``no-pass, no-play''
rule.
The importance of the 1-22 ratio is that it forces school districts to
face up to a proven standard for class size. It doesn't allow districts
to get by on the cheap. One can debate whether the state should impose
class-size ratios on school districts without fully funding them (its
own way of getting by on the cheap), but the class-size requirement is
crucial. It is a check on school boards that would just as soon pay for
Astroturf as provide an intimate setting in which to learn.
The same goes for teacher salaries and certification. Some school
boards care more about nursing a nickel than upholding high standards.
Under Bush's proposal, say, the Hard Cider ISD school board could cut
corners until there were none. It could low-ball qualified teachers
until there were none. True, under Bush's proposal, if the kids weren't
learning and the Hard Cider ISD ended up with rotten test scores, the
state could step in. Some consolation that will be for students and
teachers used as guinea pigs.
Another idea embraced by both candidates is charter schools,
state-supported schools created within a district but relieved of all
controls to encourage innovation. It's being tried in several states
with mixed results.
One of the most glaring examples of the pitfalls of charter schools is
the Noah Webster Academy in Ionia, Mich. Created by the public school
district, it is not a ``school'' at all but a front for 2,000 home
schoolers. The taxpayers of Michigan are subsidizing this ``academy''
which, depending on the home, includes religious indoctrination.
Attention, class. Religious indoctrination is not the taxpayers'
business. The Noah Webster Academy issue is bound for court.
Richards said that any experiments in charter schools under her would
entail restrictions against religious indoctrination as well as
requiring certified teachers. That would seemingly bar a Noah Webster
Academy. Good.
Deregulating schools is worthwhile -- to a degree. Schools have to do
too much at the state's bidding. They get too little compensation from
the state for their troubles. But the last thing we want is a state
school system without standards, even if the school board in Hard Cider
doesn't want them.
