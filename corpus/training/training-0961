London shares edge higher in quiet trade 
Share prices in London edged higher early on Friday, in a generally
quiet market, except for a few big stock rises, that failed to get much
direction from Wall Street overnight, dealers said.
In early trading, the FTSE-100 index of leading shares was showing a
gain of 3.8 points at 3,757.4.
In Paris, the stock market was dragged lower by weakness on the French
bond market. The CAC-40 index opened 11.17 points lower at 2,113.47.
Dealers in London said that gains in the share price of drugs giant
Glaxo Wellcome and generator National Power had added around five
points to the FTSE-100 index.
The price of shares in Glaxo Wellcome rose by 20 pence to 856,
benefiting from positive analyst comment after Thursday's four-month
trading statement that showed sales ahead of expectations.
National Power gained 10 pence to 526 on reports that the company is
planning to announce shortly a billion pound (1.5 billion dollar)
dividend hand-out to shareholders. Fellow-generator PowerGen rose by
two pence to 531 in sympathy.
Lloyds TSB advanced three pence to 327 after reports that the bank has
found a buyer for its Hill Samuel investment banking subsidiary.
Anglo-American conglomerate fell by four pence to 191 in further
reaction to Thursday's announcement of details of its demerger plans.
