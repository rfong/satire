Croatian/JJ foreign/JJ ministry/NN sources/NNS said/VBD of/IN the/DT talks/NNS :/: ``/`` We/PRP 're/VBP on/IN the/DT last/JJ stretch/NN ./.

They/PRP are/VBP at/IN a/DT stage/NN where/WRB they/PRP can/MD only/RB fail/VB or/CC succeed/VB completely/RB ./. ''/''

The/DT territorial/JJ problem/NN concerns/VBZ Prevlaka/NNP ,/, a/DT Croatian/JJ peninsula/NN that/DT borders/NNS on/IN Montenegro/NNP and/CC is/VBZ claimed/VBN by/IN Yugoslavia/NNP for/IN security/NN reasons/NNS because/IN it/PRP dominates/VBZ an/DT important/JJ Yugoslav/NNP naval/JJ base/NN in/IN Montenegro/NNP ./.

Prevlaka/NNP is/VBZ currently/RB occupied/VBN by/IN UN/NNP observers/NNS ./.

Croatia/NNP has/VBZ agreed/VBN to/TO treat/VB the/DT Prevlaka/NNP problem/NN as/IN a/DT security/NN one/NN ,/, and/CC has/VBZ proposed/VBN a/DT special/JJ dimilitarised/JJ status/NN for/IN the/DT peninsula/NN ./.
