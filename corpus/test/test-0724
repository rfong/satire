Japan plans capital move for Tokyo 
Problems of overcrowding in Tokyo have reached such a crisis point that
the authorities are thinking of setting up a new administrative capital
at the beginning of the next century.
While Tokyo's population has remained stable at around 11 million for
several years, the National Land Agency estimates that congestion will
only get worse if the city retains its current structure.
The agency says the traffic jams, the hours lost in urban transport and
the high property prices have reached a "serious level" and that
traditional measures to combat the crisis have only limited effect.
On Tuesday the government approved a white paper prepared by the agency
to support a project transferring the capital from Tokyo.
A committee set up to study the project recommended in December that
construction of a new administrative capital should be started in 2000
and finished 10 years later. A site should be chosen over the next two
years, and several regions in the centre of Japan have put themselves
forward as candidates.
The initial project foresees a city of 100,000 inhabitants, rising
rapidly to 900,000 living on 9,000 hectares. It envisages only the
transfer of government ministries and main administrative offices while
the headquarters of the big companies would stay in Tokyo.
The Tokyo prefecture has 11.77 million inhabitants, but the population
swells to 40 million, or one-third of the country's population, within
the greater Tokyo region which covers seven other prefectures.
Its inhabitants spend on general at least two years a day on public
transport travelling between their tiny homes to their overpopulated
offices.
At the weekend, they find themselves stuck in their cars in traffic
jams stretching for kilometres as they try to leave the urban sprawl.
Projections for 2000 do not see a notable change in the figures as the
Japanese population is ageing, with a growth rate of 0.3 percent.
