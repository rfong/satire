Powell and Straw compare notes on South Asia crisis
US Secretary of State Colin Powell and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw
conferred on the escalating crisis between India and Pakistan on Wednesday,
as the two nuclear armed rivals lurched closer towards war.
Powell called Straw, who heads to South Asia next week, from the
presidential jet as he travelled with President George W. Bush to
Europe, State Department deputy spokesman Philip Reeker said.
"The secretary did speak with Foreign Secretary Straw, which, as you
know, he does with some frequency on a number of topics," Reeker said.
"The situation in South Asia certainly is one of the topics they had
been discussing lately.
"We think it's vital for all sides to exercise restraint and reduce
violence. It's important for India and Pakistan to resume a productive
dialogue over the issues that divide them, including Kashmir."
Washington made a similar move earlier this year.
Straw's mission to India and Pakistan next week comes amid new signs of
a diplomatic mobilisation over the South Asian crisis.
His boss, Prime Minister Tony Blair, on Wednesday described the
India-Pakistan crisis as "grave" and called for restraint.
"I do urge both countries ... to pause and reflect before taking action
that could plunge not just their countries into conflict but the wider
region, with implications for the whole of the world," Blair told
parliament.
US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian affairs Christina Rocca
has just returned from the region, and Deputy Secretary of State
Richard Armitage is expected in India and Pakistan in early June.
Powell, mounted a personal peace shuttle earlier this year, the last
time when India-Pakistan relations threatened to boil over, following
an attack on parliament in New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based
militants.
He had since had frequent telephone conversations with President Pervez
Musharraf of Pakistan and Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh.
Tensions mounted Tuesday after the assassination of Muslim separatist
leader Abdul Ghani Lone, an executive member of the main separatist
alliance in Kashmir, the All Party Hurriyat Conference.
Reeker described increased shelling across the Line of Control (LOC) in
Kashmir in recent days as a "worrisome."
As tensions mounted in South Asia, Britain on Monday decided to pull
out more than 150 diplomatic staff and dependents out of Pakistan over
a security threat.
Washington made a similar move earlier this year.
