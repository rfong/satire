Unemployment Rate in New Zealand Keeps Rising 
The unemployment rate in New Zealand rose from 7.7 percent in June to
8.1 percent in September and is expected to peak at 8.8 percent in the
middle of next year, the Evening Post reported Monday.
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted a local economist as saying that
a weak domestic economy, troubled offshore markets and tariff cuts are
the main reasons for the lengthening jobless queue.
According to the figures for June released by New Zealand's Household
Labor Force Survey, 140,600 New Zealanders were out of work,
WestpacTrust economist Paul Gardiner said. Data from the latest survey
for September, due to be released on Thursday, will show unemployment
has risen above eight percent to 147,600, he added.
"Such a result will see the unemployment rate rise from 7.7 percent in
June to 8.1 percent in September, the highest level since the 1991
recession," Gardiner said.
He said that the labor market tends to lag behind economic activity and
therefore he expected the unemployment rate to move higher in the
months ahead.
"We expect the unemployment rate to peak at 8.8 percent in the middle
of next year," Gardiner said.
The unemployment rate in New Zealand would fall to 7.5 percent by March
2000, according to the WestpacTrust economist.
