Packers end 49ers' NFL reign 
American football will have a new Super Bowl champion in 1996 and it
might just be a club that has not played in the title game since 1968.
San Francisco's reign over the National Football League (NFL) ended
here Saturday with a 27-17 loss to Green Bay.
The Packers will play the winner of Sunday's playoff game between
Dallas and Philadelphia on January 14 for a berth in the January 28
Super Bowl.
The outcome was a surprise but not astonishing. The 49ers struggled
late in the season while the Packers had one of their most impressive
campaigns since winning the first two Super Bowl titles in 1967 and
1968.
Green Bay grabbed a 21-0 lead in the first 19 minutes and cruised from
there, with Packer passer Brett Favre showing why he was named the
NFL's Most Valuable Player.
Favre threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Keith Jackson in the first
quarter and a 13-yard touchdown toss to Mark Chmura in the second. He
completed 15 of 17 first-half throws for 222 yards as the Packers
rolled through the San Francisco pass defense.
Green Bay's pass defense, rated the NFL's best, shut down San Francisco
quarterback Steve Young and produced the game's first score. On the
first 49er scrimmage play, Green Bay linebacker Wayne Simmons knocked
loose the football from Adam Walker.
Cornerback Craig Newsome returned the fumble 31 yards for a touchdown
midway through the first quarter, setting the tone for the game.
San Francisco reached the Packer 5-yard line late in the first half,
but Young threw two incomplete passes and was stopped short on a run,
forcing the 49ers to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Jeff Wilkins
and a 21-3 half-time deficit.
Young ran one yard for a touchdown midway through the third quarter to
pull San Francisco closer, but Chris Jacke boosted Green Bay's lead
with a 27-yard field goal.
The game's second turnover came when the Packers knocked loose the ball
from Young and recovered to set up a 26-yard Jacke field goal midway
through the fourth quarter to put Green Bay ahead 27-10.
Derek Loville added the final points on a two-yard touchdown run with
50 seconds to play. Young attempted an NFL playoff record 65 pass
attempts.
Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren was born and raised here and coached
youth and college teams in the area before joining the 49ers. He worked
his way into the offensive coordinator position before departing in
1992 to become coach of the Packers.
