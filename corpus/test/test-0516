240 Russians from India hospitalized for observation 
Some 240 Russians who arrived here Friday on a flight from New Delhi
were admitted to hospital where they will remain for a week of
observation to make sure none has the plague, ITAR-TASS news agency
said.
Each passenger was to undergo complete health tests and was to be kept
at Moscow's No. 10 hospital for six days as a preventative health
measure regardless of the test results, TASS said quoting the Public
Health Ministry.
The report said specialists were "highly optimistic" that none of the
passengers was infected with pneumonic plague which has caused dozens
of deaths in India and caused alarm worldwide.
