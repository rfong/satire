Jamaica Defeats St. Lucia, St. Lucia Whips the Cayman Islands 
Jamaica's soccer team is a step closer to victory in the Caribbean Zone
Olympic Qualifying playoff after defeating Antigua-Barbuda six goals to
one Tuesday night.
It was the second six-goal defeat Jamaica handed out at the National
Stadium. It beat St. Lucia six goals to none on Sunday.
Tuesday, Onandi Lowe scored a hat trick for Jamaica, scoring in the
19th, 38th and 55th minutes.
Other scorers were Ian Belford, in the 23rd minute; Christopher Dawes,
in the 42nd minute; and Fabian Davis, in the 81st minute.
Antiguan striker Conrad White put in the twin-island state's only goal
in the 44th minute.
Also Tuesday, St. Lucia beat the Cayman Islands by 4 goals to none.
Andy Baptiste scored three goals, in the 65th, 71st and 88th minutes.
The fourth goal was scored by Titus Elva in the 68th minute.
Jamaica now has a maximum of six points and the Cayman Islands and St.
Lucia have three points each. Antigua-Barbuda is yet to get a point.
Jamaica is scheduled to play the Cayman Islands Thursday and
Antigua-Barbuda is to play St. Lucia.
The winner will qualify to compete in the Confederation of North,
Central American and Caribbean Football playoff in Edmonton, Canada in
1996. That contest will decide the qualifiers for the Atlanta Olympics
later that year.
