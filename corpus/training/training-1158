Refugees From Bosnia Continue to Find New Beginnings in North Dakota
Carrying a single suitcase and looking dazed and exhausted, Dragisa
Milovic became the latest refugee from war-torn Bosnia to make North
Dakota his new home.
Milovic's face brightened and he relaxed as a group from the Grand
Forks Bosnian refugee community stepped forward to welcome him off the
plane Wednesday.
Speaking through an interpreter, Milovic said he hadn't known there
were any Bosnians in Grand Forks. He had just hoped somebody would be
there to meet him.
Audrey McClellan, coordinator of the Grand Forks Area Refugee
Resettlement Coalition, said the group makes a big effort to be at the
airport to meet new refugees.
Milovic is feeling scared and excited, said Nikica Todorovic, who
translated for Milovic.
Todorovic arrived from Bosnia 14 months ago. He said Milovic's first
week will be ``so nice a dream.''
A refugee camp in Belgrade had been Milovic's home for the past year
and a half. Conditions in the camps are grim, Todorovic said. ``Not
starving, but close.''
Milovic left without his parents and a brother who remain in a refugee
camp. The family fled their home in Tuzla in 1994. Though the city is
considered to be a safe area, Todorovic firmly said, ``There is no safe
place in Bosnia.''
Milovic, 33, said he hopes his family will join him. He didn't want to
talk yet about his war experience.
In the coming months, he must find a job and begin a new life.
He will stay in a small apartment and receive a week's supply of food.
The coalition and volunteers will help him find a job and learn
English.
