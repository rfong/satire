The city's health director has banned swimming in one stretch of the
Rio Grande because the death of a 13-year-old boy last month in the
Mexican town of Rio Bravo, 12 miles south of here, has been traced to
naegleria, an amoeba that can cause deadly brain infections and is
found in the river water.
The director of the Laredo Health Department, Jerry R. Robinson,
confirmed Monday that naegleria was contaminating river water, as well
as the pond used for water treatment in Rio Bravo. This amoeba, found
in water and soil, has been cited in the death of the Rio Bravo
teen-ager.
``It is the first time that we've got an absolutely scientifically
validated cause and effect in the death of this young boy, a cause of
death related to the high pollution of the river,'' Robinson said.
The teen-ager died July 23 of meningo encephalitis, a swelling of the
brain caused by a naegleria infection, after he and two friends had
been swimming in the river, Robinson said. The two friends also became
ill but survived, he said.
Last week Robinson posted official warnings against swimming in the Rio
Grande south of Laredo's Mexican sister city, Nuevo Laredo. He said no
one should swim in the river as far downstream as the boundary between
Webb County, in which Laredo is located, and Zapata County. He also
warned against swimming in the Rio Bravo Settling Pond, where untreated
river water is temporarily stored to allow large particles to settle to
the bottom.
``Very conservatively, I'd say that Nuevo Laredo pumps 24 million
gallons per day of residential and industrial waste straight into the
river,'' Robinson said. ``Nuevo Laredo is 146 years old and has never
had a sewage treatment plant. You'd be swimming in sewage.''
Nearly 600 miles upstream, Dr. Laurance N. Nickey, director of the
health department for El Paso's city and county, said he had ordered
sampling along a 10-mile stretch of the river there in response to the
Laredo findings.
``I've lived in El Paso all my life,'' Nickey said, ``and I used to
swim in the river as a boy. I wouldn't put my foot in it now.''
Health officials up and down the Rio Grande have warned for years about
the dangers of swimming in some polluted areas or eating fish caught in
such areas, but Robinson said his was the first community to post
official notices.
Although some stretches of the river are popular recreation areas,
others are heavily polluted by untreated residential and industrial
waste. Even so, these areas are often used by swimmers and by people
crossing illegally from Mexico to the United States to work.

The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement has focused
attention on the fact that few Mexican communities along the Rio Grande
have modern plants to treat sewage because more plants are being built
along the border. Nuevo Laredo is building a sewage-treatment plant,
which could be operating by year's end.
A $352,000 grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is
financing a study of water, sediment and fish samples from the Rio
Grande, from El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico, looking for toxic
chemicals. Concern for water quality in the Rio Grande has heightened
because researchers have discovered an unusually high incidence of
devastating brain defects in infants, which could be linked to
pollution.
``This is a very specific kind of amoeba,'' Robinson said. ``It only
thrives in polluted or stagnant water. It's also very rare.''
He noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
had reported fewer than 100 deaths in the United States from naegleria
brain infection. ``It's not something you're going to obtain casually
or from some other source,'' he said.
