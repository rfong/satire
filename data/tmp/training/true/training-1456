John/NNP Redwood/NNP ,/, the/DT right-winger/NN who/WP challenged/VBD Prime/NNP Minister/NNP John/NNP Major/NNP for/IN the/DT Conservative/JJ party/NN leadership/NN in/IN the/DT summer/NN ,/, said/VBD :/: ``/`` I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBN five/CD billion/CD pounds/NNS off/IN taxes/NNS ''/'' ./.

Redwood/NNS and/CC others/NNS from/IN the/DT party/NN 's/POS populist/JJ wing/NN had/VBD argued/VBN that/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS '/POS only/JJ chance/NN of/IN avoiding/VBG certain/JJ defeat/NN in/IN the/DT next/JJ general/JJ elections/NNS ,/, which/WDT must/MD be/VB held/VBN by/IN early/RB 1997/CD at/IN the/DT latest/JJS ,/, was/VBD to/TO hand/VB voters/NNS a/DT massive/JJ tax/NN present/NN ./.

The/DT right-wing/JJ Sun/NNP tabloid/JJ newspaper/NN ,/, Britain/NNP 's/POS largest-circulation/JJ daily/NN ,/, spoke/VBD for/IN them/PRP when/WRB it/PRP splashed/VBD the/DT words/NNS :/: ``/`` You/PRP Ken/VB Not/RB Be/VB Serious/VBN ''/'' across/IN its/PRP$ front/JJ page/NN ,/, branding/VBG the/DT one/CD percent/NN cut/NN in/IN income/NN tax/NN as/IN ``/`` miserly/JJ ''/'' ./.

In/IN more/JJR measured/JJ words/NNS ,/, one/CD senior/JJ Conservative/NN told/VBD The/DT Times/NNP broadsheet/NN that/IN the/DT budget/NN ``/`` will/MD win/VB us/PRP nothing/NN at/IN all/DT .../: we/PRP had/VBD better/JJR pray/NN that/IN he/PRP -LRB-/-LRB- Clarke/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- can/MD do/VB more/RBR next/JJ year/NN ''/'' ./.

But/CC Clarke/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ a/DT moderate/JJ figure/NN within/IN the/DT Conservative/JJ party/NN ,/, has/VBZ stressed/VBN repeatedly/RB that/IN he/PRP will/MD not/RB sacrifice/VB Britain/NNP 's/POS finances/NNS for/IN political/JJ reasons/NNS ./.

In/IN a/DT television/NN interview/NN early/JJ Wednesday/NNP ,/, he/PRP defended/VBD his/PRP$ caution/NN :/: ``/`` My/PRP$ job/NN as/IN Conservative/JJ chancellor/NN is/VBZ to/TO run/VB the/DT economy/NN and/CC keep/VB this/DT economy/NN growing/VBG faster/RBR than/IN anybody/NN else/RB 's/POS and/CC that/DT is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP will/MD do/VB ''/'' ./.

Clarke/NNP therefore/RB made/VBD sure/JJ to/TO balance/VB the/DT tax/NN cuts/NNS with/IN equivalent/JJ spending/NN cuts/NNS ,/, focused/VBN mainly/RB on/IN public/JJ sector/NN capital/NN projects/NNS and/CC public/JJ administration/NN costs/NNS ./.

Labor/NNP leader/NN Tony/NNP Blair/NNP swept/VBD aside/RP Clarke/NNP 's/POS statement/NN that/IN the/DT tax/NN cuts/NNS will/MD give/VB a/DT typical/JJ married/JJ couple/NN with/IN two/CD children/NNS and/CC one/CD wage-earner/NN on/IN average/JJ earnings/NNS an/DT extra/JJ 450/CD pounds/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 695/CD dollars/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- a/DT year/NN ./.

The/DT budget/NN had/VBD ``/`` flopped/UH ''/'' ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, because/IN ``/`` people/NNS realize/VBP they/PRP are/VBP still/RB worse/JJR off/RP ''/'' ./.

``/`` People/NNS do/VBP n't/RB trust/VB the/DT Tories/NNPS on/IN tax/NN anymore/RB ''/'' ,/, Blair/NNP charged/VBD ./.

The/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ,/, meanwhile/RB ,/, did/VBD not/RB welcome/VB the/DT budget/NN with/IN open/JJ arms/NNS either/RB ,/, worried/VBN about/IN the/DT worse/JJR projection/NN revealed/VBN by/IN Clarke/NNP for/IN the/DT government/NN deficit/NN in/IN 1995-96/CD ./.

``/`` The/DT budget/NN was/VBD too/RB tight/JJ to/TO win/VB the/DT election/NN and/CC too/RB loose/JJ to/TO impress/VB the/DT markets/NNS '/POS ,/, an/DT economist/NN at/IN a/DT major/JJ US/NNP bank/NN said/VBD ./.

And/CC this/DT might/MD do/VB more/JJR to/TO secure/VB the/DT elusive/JJ ``/`` feel-good/JJ ''/'' factor/NN among/IN the/DT British/JJ population/NN than/IN the/DT much-trumpeted/JJ budget/NN ./.
