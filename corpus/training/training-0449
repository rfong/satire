S.African President Blames Poverty for Spread of 
South African President Thabo Mbeki on Sunday blamed poverty for
fueling all kinds of illnesses, including AIDS.
Poverty, malnutrition and poor socio-economic conditions were major
contributors to fatal infections and diseases in Africa, he said at the
opening of the five-day 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban .
"We cannot blame everything on a single virus....but poverty is the
underlying cause of reduced life expectancy, handicap, disability,
starvation, mental illness, stress, suicide, family disintegration and
substance abuse," Mbeki said.
He told thousands of people gathering at Kingsmead Cricket Stadium that
the world's biggest killer and greatest cause of ill-health and
suffering was extreme poverty, and not the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
It is because of poverty, the least developed countries suffered the
heaviest toll of AIDS-related deaths, Mbeki said.
Quoting World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, he said each year
12. 2 million children from developing countries under the age of five
died.
"They die largely because of world indifference, but mostly because
they are poor."
In some of the poorest countries life expectancy was expected to
decrease to 42 years, whereas in the richest countries it was predicted
to reach 79 years by the end of 2000, he said.
He expressed hope that the "extraordinary" gathering of health experts
at the conference would map a plan of action to assist Africa to
"disperse the menacing and frightening clouds" of the increasing
HIV/AIDS pandemic that threatened to destroy people worldwide.
