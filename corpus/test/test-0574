EU partners reject Athens preconditions for customs union 
Greece's European Union (EU) partners rejected most of Athens'
conditions for lifting its veto on EU customs union with Turkey,
diplomatic sources said after an EU ministerial meeting Tuesday.
"The prevailing feeling is one of disappointment, we can only say that
there is very little possibility of a breakthough," one source said.
The 15 EU states and Turkey agreed in principle to set up a customs
union during a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels last week, but
the Greek government has four conditions must be met before it lifts
its veto.
Two of them are unacceptable, sources said. One is Athens demand for
guarantees for its textile industry. The other is to increase European
Parliament oversight of a proposed EU financial protocol with Turkey.
Greece says this would assuage parliamentarians' concern over Turkey's
human rights record, criticized because of Ankara's treatment of the
Kurdish minority.
"It is unthinkable that we reopen the textile chapter," a source said.
Other countries whose textile industries are in difficulty, like Spain
and Germany, are also opposed to the Greeks being given special
guarantees for their industry in the face of stiff competition from
Turkey when the EU market is opened to them.
Another diplomat said the EU had to honor its commitment to the
financial protocol as well.
Greece is also demanding that a firm date be set for opening
negotiations for Cyprus to join the EU. A compromise reached within the
EU last week, which was rejected by Greece, said that talks about
membership for Cyprus "could begin" six months after an EU
intergovernmental conference next year on reviewing the Maastricht
treaty.
Greece wanted the 15 members of the EU to adopt a formula "without
reservations or nuances" by stating that the membership negotiations
"will begin" six months after the conference.
This dispute "is turning out to be the least difficult to resolve," a
diplomat said.
France, which currently holds the presidency of the Union, will
continue to search for a compromise -- including, if necessary, another
EU ministerial meeting -- before the next scheduled talks with Turkey
on March 6.
