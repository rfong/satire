European Shares Down Sharply as Rate Cut Hopes Wither 
Leading European stock markets reversed their recent gains and closed
sharply lower today as hopes of a long-awaited interest rates cut in
Germany was dampened by an influential business survey.
The survey of business conditions in Germany climbed to an eight-month
high of 94.1 points last month, showing a sudden surge of confidence in
the country's economic recovery.
Shares prices in Frankfurt fell on the news as dealers thought that the
Bundesbank would be under no pressure to cut its rates to boost the
economy.
The London stock market extended its Tuesday's surge and hit a new
intraday peak of 3,894.4 earlier today on today's July retail trade
figures which suffered a surprise 0.6 percent drop. The weak data
raised the possibility of yet another interest rates cut.
But London's Financial Times-Stock Market Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 11.1 points lower after a fall on Wall Street and
profit-taking dealings.
The Paris bourse finished sharply lower, subdued by a weak franc,
evaporating hopes of a German rate cut and the lower start on Wall
Street although it managed to maintain the 2,000 level.
London's FTSE 100 index closed down 11.1 points at 3,872.1. Paris's
CAC-40 index finished down 18.62 at 2,000.64. Frankfurt's DAX-30 shares
ended down 16.52 at 2,543.74.
