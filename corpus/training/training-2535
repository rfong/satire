Sen. Christopher Dodd, incoming leader of the Democratic National
Committee, promised Friday to take the offensive with the new
Republican majority. He even invoked the name of an old enemy, the late
Lee Atwater, the unapologetically combative Republican strategist.
He lost no time keeping his pledge.
During a conversation with his Republican counterpart, Haley Barbour,
on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Dodd attacked the House speaker, Newt
Gingrich, saying he had called Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, the Democratic
speaker who died last year, ``the most corrupt speaker in history.''
A short while later, Dodd criticized Gingrich as having said that a
number of the ``White House people were on drugs.''
Tony Blankley, Gingrich's spokesman, instantly went on the
counterattack. He said that Gingrich had never called O'Neill
``corrupt,'' a term the new speaker applies to another of his
Democratic predecessors, Jim Wright. And he said Gingrich had never
said ``two-thirds to one-third'' of White House staff members used
drugs. Instead, Blankley said, Gingrich had said a quarter of the White
House staff had used illegal drugs in past years.
``We're requesting Senator Dodd to immediately correct his
statements,'' Blankley said.
Dodd's spokesman, Marvin Fast, fired right back. Without commenting on
the accuracy of Dodd's remarks, he said the Connecticut Democrat ``was
trying to make a point that Newt Gingrich throughout his entire
congressional career has been prone to making gross, harsh and
outrageous personal attacks and overstatements. There is ample evidence
of this,'' Fast said. ``Would Gingrich deny this?''
