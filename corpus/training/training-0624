Loans to Small, Medium-Sized Industries Fall 
The flow of bank loans to export-oriented small and medium-sized
industries in Bangladesh has declined and created working capital
crisis.
A review report of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) said that big
sectors like garments and tea were getting preference in getting loans
from the banks, The Independent daily newspaper reported Sunday.
EPB sources were quoted as saying that while reviewing the situation
with all related agencies and institutions, they found that credits to
the export-oriented industries in the smaller sectors had declined in
comparison to industries in the bigger sectors.
The EPB also found less credit flow to some of the big export sectors
such as raw jute and jute goods in recent months. "Agro-based products,
petroleum products and handicraft are the other sectors which got less
credits," said a senior official of the EPB.
Meanwhile, a recent meeting of the Task Force on Export under the
Commerce Ministry reviewed the country's export performance for the
first six months of the current 1998-99 fiscal year.
Total export during the July-December 1998 period was 2,560.71 million
U.S. dollars, about 9 percent short of the targeted 2,815 million
dollars and 1.5 percent less than that of the corresponding period of
the previous year.
All the export-oriented sectors except tea suffered setbacks compared
to their targets. The July-December 1998 target of tea export was 21
million dollars while the actual export stood at 25.36 million dollars,
showing a 20-percent increase.
