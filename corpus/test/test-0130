Over One Million Portraits of Deng on Sale 
More than one million pictures of Deng Xiaoping have been printed to
meet the sudden demand all over the country since the retired senior
leader died of illness in Beijing last Wednesday.
Printers at the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, the publisher of
the colored portrait, and three other printing houses have worked day
and night since then so that they could finish 1.05 million orders
before noon today.
The pictures will soon be transported by air to different parts of the
country. But the publisher expects the demand to increase in the coming
few days.
Chinese people have flocked to local bookstores to buy pictures of Deng
as a way to express their deep sorrow and grief at losing a great
leader.
In Chengdu City, capital of Deng's home province of Sichuan, about
10,000 portraits were sold out within an hour on Saturday, the first
day they were made available.
Meanwhile, books, picture albums and audio and video publications with
Deng themes have also become hot sellers all over China.
