Nissan to import Mexican-made vehicles to US market 
Nissan said Wednesday it would begin importing Mexican-made vehicles to
the US market to meet demand and replace higher-cost Japanese
production.
About 20,000 of the 140,000 compact Sentra sedans for the US market
next year will come from the company's Mexican plant in Aguascalientes,
said Earl Hesterberg, vice president of the US unit of the Japanese
automaker.
The company imported 20,000 Sentras from Japan to meet strong US demand
this year, but Hesterberg said the strong yen makes it more economical
to produce the vehicles in Mexico.
Nissan lost 835 million dollars in the year ending March 31, and has
excess capacity at its two plants in Mexico, which currently produce
cars for Latin America.
Nissan's sales in the United States have been rising, and Hesterberg
said the US unit's biggest problem is a shortage of popular cars and
trucks. About 70 percent of Nissan vehicles sold in the US market are
built in the United States, with none of the US-made cars exported to
Japan.
General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Germany's Volkswagen have produced
cars in Mexico for the US market, and Japan's Honda has announced plans
for a Mexican assembly plant.
