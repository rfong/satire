France Dismayed by U.S. Plane Crash 
French President Jacques Chirac expressed dismay to U.S. President Bill
Clinton today over the explosion near New York of a Boeing 747 of the
TWA air company, which killed all the 229 people aboard.
"In the explosion of this plane, French victims and American victims
died," Chirac said.
He said the victims would remain long in his memory. He was sure that
the circumstances surrounding the explosion would be made clear.
Meanwhile, French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said
that the French government would be in permanent contact with the U.S.
authorities on investigative developments into the explosion and the
search for possible survivors.
The spokesman said there were some French nationals on the aircraft but
he was unable to say how many.
The Paris-bound TWA Boeing 747 blew up mid-air in a fireball this
morning soon after taking off from the Kennedy international airport.
Rescuers in the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island said there were no signs
of survivors from the 229 people on board.
Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris set up a "trauma response team" made
up of police, airport officials and doctors, to comfort waiting
relatives of the French victims.
