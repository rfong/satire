"Based on the existing GDP (gross domestic product) of Johore state, the
average development value of this project will add three percent to the GDP
annually for the next 10 years," Hong said.
Officials said the proposed city was strategically located between
Singapore and Johore Bahru which together with the Indonesian island of
Batam now form an economic growth triangle under the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) cooperation concept.
All available space at the Johore Bahru Waterfront City's first
development, a retail complex known as LOT 1, had been pre-sold before
the launch Friday.
"The project will transform Johore Bahru into a modern metropolis,"
Mahathir said, adding that investors had already committed some 250
million ringgit (100 million dollars) in terms of booked space.
Officials said plans were also underway to set up an underwater marine
park with submarine glassed walkways and attractions.
Pilecon signed an agreement with utility company Telecom Malaysia for
the installation of advanced telecommunication facilities and services
for the project.
The stock of Pilecon rose 14 sen to 3.22 ringgit on the local bourse in
afternoon trade Friday.
