Dinner with Prime Minister Major at 100,000 Pounds 
British Prime Minister John Major and his Cabinet colleagues are being
hired out for private dinners with businessmen by a secretive
Conservative fund-raising organization in return for up to 100,000
pounds (150,000 U.S. dollars), the Observer newspaper reported today.
The donations are being channeled through the Premier Club, which was
established last November with Prime Minister Major as its patron and
Conservative party chairman Brian Mawhinney as its President, the
report said.
The Premier Club is thought to have two tiers: "Ordinary members" are
invited to have suppers with Cabinet members at the price of 10,000
pounds (15,000 dollars); "founder members" are invited to have two
dinners a year with Prime Minister Major at 100,000 pounds (150,000
dollars).
Frances Prenn, the Club's membership secretary, revealed the "unique
benefits" for those who pay six-figure sums, saying "Sometimes there's
a very sensitive political issue: we try and tell them what's the best
way of getting around it".
"And if there are specific business concerns, we will try and assist in
getting that answered. We can't promise what the end result will be,
but we can certainly facilitate an opportunity for one to air one's
views," she said.
Political commentators predict that the disclosure of the details of
the Premier Club operation will severely embarrass Major, who has
claimed, after repeated scandals over secret donors to the party, to
have distanced himself from the process.
Meanwhile, senior Shadow Cabinet member Robin Cook is reported as
saying, "the very name of this club is intended to convey the
impression that you get access to the Prime Minister. Businessmen are
being given influence by access to government ministers."
