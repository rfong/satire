Butyrskaya Wins to Complete Russia's Sweeping 
Maria Butyrskaya won the women's short program in the last day of the
European figure skating championships on Saturday in Milan, Italy,
completing Russia's sweeping of the medals for the second successive
year.
Butyrskaya, who took once a third in the European championships in
1996, shaked off a mistake on her opening triple lutz jump to lead all
the way to the trophy, while all her rivals faltered.
Russian Irina Slutskaya was tossed down to the second and German Tanja
Szewczenko third. All of the three finished with 3.5 factored
placements while Butyrskaya gained score on the free skating, which
worth two-thrids of the total.
The Russian got five scores of 5.9 out of the maximum of 6.0 for
artistry.
