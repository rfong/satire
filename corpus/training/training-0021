Japan's vice health minister resigns over gift-taking scandal 
The top bureaucrat of Japan's health and welfare ministry resigned
Tuesday, a day after the newspapers accused him of receiving certain
favours from the head of a group operating nursing homes.
Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi told a news conference
early Tuesday that he had accepted the resignation of vice minister
Nobuharu Okamitsu, the top bureaucrat in the ministry.
The resignation came hours after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
expressed anger over his admission that he had received certain favours
from Hiroshi Koyama, 51, who was arrested Monday over a separate
bribery case.
