Hashimoto says it's 'difficult' to assess Japan's wartime record 
Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Friday it was "difficult"
to assess his country's wartime record but acknowledged that Japanese
"acts of aggression" had caused grief in many countries.
"There are various arguments, so it is difficult to say something
decisive," he told parliament in reply to a question from Japan
Communist Party lawmaker Hiroshi Tachiki who asked if Japan waged a war
of aggression in World War II.
Hashimoto said Japan's "colonial rule and acts of aggression in the
past" has caused "grief and suffering to people in many countries",
adding that this was cause for deep reflection" on which Japan should
contribute to world peace.
Former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa came under fire from rightists,
including conservative members of Hashimoto's own Liberal Democratic
Party, for admitting in 1993 that Japan played an aggressive role in
World War II.
Hashimoto's predecessor Tomiichi Murayama, the Social Democratic Party
chairman who unexpectedly resigned earlier this month, made similar
remarks.
Since assuming the leadership of the LDP in September, Hashimoto has
resigned as head of an association of war-bereaved families.
The association strongly opposed assertions that Japan was the
aggressor during World War II.
The group also encouraged cabinet ministers to pay annual pilgrimages
to Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni shrine where Japan's war dead,
including convicted war criminals, are enshrined.
