Three airlines suspend flight to South Africa 
Three major airlines announced Friday they were suspending flights on
the South African route due to low profitability, public SABC
television news reported.
The decision by Gulf Air, Air India and Air Sri Lanka will affect
passengers booked on flights to the Far East and on Gulf Air's route to
the United States, the report said.
Gulf Air said it had taken several measures to ensure people booked on
their flights will reach their destinations.
