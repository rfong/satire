Myanmar-Chinese Denounce NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy 
Myanmar-Chinese and Chinese nationals in Myanmar Monday strongly
condemned the missile attack launched by the U.S.-led NATO on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, which resulted in heavy
casualties.
Jiang Qinglian, director-general of the Overseas Chinese Chamber of
Commerce in Myanmar, said in an interview with Xinhua that the NATO
attack violated the United Nations Charter and the Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations as well as the basic norms governing international
relations.
The attack infringed on the Chinese sovereignty and was an unforgivable
crime.
Myanmar-Chinese and Chinese nationals residing in Myanmar expressed
great indignation at and strong condemnation of NATO's atrocities, he
said, demanding NATO bear all the responsibilities for this act.
In another interview with Xinhua, Lu Zhenbin, chairman of the Fujian
Native Association, said overseas Chinese in Myanmar were greatly
shocked and indignant at NATO's air attack on the Chinese Embassy and
lodged a strong protest over it.
He said "the barbarous crimes of NATO must be exposed and criticized,"
adding that the era of Chinese people being willfully bullied by others
has gone for ever.
Lu Xiulian, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Women's Association, said
the U.S.-led NATO's air attack on the Chinese Embassy was a
well-planned conspiracy.
She said that hegemonism is doomed to failure.
