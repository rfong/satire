Bosnian Serb head seeks immediate peace talks with government 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic called on the Bosnian government
Saturday to resume peace talks immediately, after a week of attacks by
the Moslem-led government forces on Serb positions in northeast Bosnia.
The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA quoted Karadzic as calling for "an
immediate resumption of direct peace negotiations, the ending of all
offensive operations, and the withdrawal of (Bosnian) forces to lines
separating" the two sides before the December 24 ceasefire.
SRNA described his appeal as an "open message" and a "last appeal" to
the Bosnian government and international community in a report
monitored here.
"In their most recent offensives, the Moslem side has engaged in a
major war which will not be ended by the ceasefires the international
community calls for each time the Moslems are threatened with defeat,"
Karadzic said.
He said the Serbs were prepared for "an immediate end to the war" but
that if hostilities continued, they would press on to "a rapid and
total victory against the enemy and defend their state (the
self-proclaimed Serb Republic) by all possible means."
Fierce fighting has been going on for a week in the Majevica mountain
range in northeast Bosnia, where the mainly Moslem government forces
have launched an offensive against Serb positions, according to the UN
Protection Force.
The fighting has intensified despite a ceasefire scheduled to last
until the end of next month.
On Friday Karadzic said he had made a new proposal to end the stalemate
over the international "contact group" peace plan for Bosnia, but
refused to disclose details.
Karadzic told supporters in Bijeljina in northeastern
Bosnia-Hercegovina that he had submitted the proposal to European Union
negotiator David Owen and his UN counterpart Thorvald Stoltenberg at a
meeting Thursday in Zvornik in eastern Bosnia-Hercegovina, the Yugoslav
news agency Beta said.
The Bosnian Serbs overwhelmingly rejected the current contact group
peace plan in a referendum last year, balking at their demand to scale
down their share from 70 percent of Bosnia to 49 percent as required by
the plan.
