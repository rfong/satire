McDonald's wins "battle of the burgers" in S. Africa 
The McDonald's Corporation on Tuesday won, on appeal, a lengthy court
battle to prevent two South African fast food outlets using its name
and trademark "golden arches."
In a ruling by the appeal court based in this central city, the
restaurants were restrained from "imitating, reproducing or
translating" the hamburger giant's trademarks in which the word
"McDonald's" or "MacDonald's" appears.
The ruling reverses a judgement in October 1995 when the Supreme Court
found against McDonald's and ruled that Joburgers Drive-Inn Restaurant
Dax Prop could continue to use the name.
At the centre of the "battle of the burgers," which began shortly
before the real McDonald's opened its first outlet in South Africa last
year, was how "well-known" the McDonald's trademark was in the country.
The Appeal Court Tuesday took into account that McDonald's is "one of
the largest, if not the largest" franchiser of fast food restaurants in
the world, with 13,993 outlets in 70 countries in 1993.
Evidence that McDonald's trademarks were, in all probability, some of
the best known trademarks in the world was not denied, the court added,
according to the SAPA news agency.
The court said the very fact the two South African restaurants had gone
to "considerable expense and trouble" to adopt the McDonald's name and
trademarks confirmed the US corporation's reputation.
McDonald is a fairly common surname, the court said, and had it not
been for the reputation it had acquired over the years, nobody would
wish to appropriate it.
