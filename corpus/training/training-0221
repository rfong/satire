Computerized Teaching to Be Adopted in Angolan 
Computerized teaching will be introduced soon at the "Future Teachers"
School which was founded in Huambo, central Angola, by a Swedish
non-governmental organization the People Aid People.
This was disclosed recently by an official of the school in an
interview with the Angola News Agency.
He said that the move is aimed at improving teaching quality through
advanced scientific technology, adding that the school has bought 30
computers, software required and a digital library.
The "Future Teachers" is a normal school for training teachers for the
rural areas of Angola. After graduation from the school, the graduates
must teach in primary or middle schools in the countryside to reduce
illiteracy and promote development there.
The "People Aid People" is expected to set up 16 teachers training
schools in Angola to boost the development of education in Angola. So
far, three such schools including the "Future Teachers" in Huambo has
been established.
