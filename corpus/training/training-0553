Informal Mideast talks in S Africa end with peace plea
Israeli "doves" and Palestinian delegates Friday made an impassioned plea
for peace in the Middle East after three days of informal talks on the
conflict in light of South Africa's experience.
"We came here to listen to the great experience in South Africa. You
have inspired us," said chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat.
Drawing on South Africa's peaceful transition to democracy in 1994,
both Erekat and his Israeli counterpart Yossi Beilin stressed the
importance of peace in their region.
"There will never be a military solution, it cannot be through guns,
but through peace," Erakat said.
But this could only be achieved with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon returning to the negotiating table, he said.
Beilin said the Middle East peace process was at a low point with the
recent killing of four Israeli soldiers and the bulldozing of homes in
the Gaza Strip by the Israeli army.
"The largest conflict in the world ... should be solved and can be
solved," said Beilin, a former cabinet minister and architect of the
1993 Oslo Peace Accords.
"These talks were a precedent for us," he said.
The meeting on the Spier wine estate near Stellenbosch, about 60
kilometres (40 miles) from Cape Town, began behind closed doors
Wednesday amid tight security.
Former apartheid politicians, and those who represented the now ruling
African National Congress (ANC) during South Africa's transition to
democracy before 1994, drew parallels and shared experiences with the
visiting delegations.
South African President Thabo Mbeki spent three days with the
Palestinian and Israeli delegates, who were gathered with other
politicians who had negotiated South Africa's peaceful transition to
democracy.
