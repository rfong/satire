Egypt Denies Advising Arafat over Declaring State 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Sunday denied Egypt has ever
advised Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat over the
timing of his declaration of a Palestinian state.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with some visiting foreign leaders,
Moussa said his country has not imposed any opinion on Arafat in this
regard.
He dismissed as "not true" the reports alleging Egypt has recommended
that Arafat backtrack on the declaration of the Palestinian state on
May 4.
Earlier Arafat announced he will declare an independent Palestinian
state on May 4 regardless of the results of the peace talks with
Israel.
The Jewish state, however, is opposed to the possible move, denouncing
it as a unilateral action and threatening to take tough actions against
the step, including annexation of parts of the West Bank.
Egypt is concerned with the negotiations between Arab countries,
including Syria and Lebanon, and Israel, the Palestinian track in
particular, Moussa said.
The issue of the Palestinian state is "a main issue in the Egyptian
policy and diplomacy," he said, adding that detailed discussions are
going on in this regard between Egypt and other countries concerned.
Meanwhile, Moussa stressed that it is Arafat who has the authority to
make a decision over the declaration of the Palestinian state and its
date.
The establishment of the Palestinian state will close the Palestinian
track in the Middle East peace process, he added.
Moussa has said earlier that there will be no comprehensive peace in
the Middle East without a Palestinian state, warning that the conflict
between Arab countries and Israel will "remain open" if the
Palestinians do not have their own state as the Palestinian issue is
the core of the conflict in the past half century.
