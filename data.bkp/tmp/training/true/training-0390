A/DT new/JJ name/NN was/VBD announced/VBN Thursday/NNP --/: the/DT New/NNP Frontier/NNP Party/NNP --/: but/CC its/PRP$ formation/NN means/VBZ the/DT end/NN of/IN six/CD parties/NNS and/CC several/JJ splinter/NN groups/NNS ,/, including/VBG the/DT Liberals/NNS and/CC Democratic/JJ Socialists/NNS ./.

A/DT group/NN of/IN 225/CD opposition/NN lawmakers/NNS forming/VBG the/DT new/JJ party/NN voted/VBD on/IN the/DT name/NN after/IN hiring/VBG a/DT panel/NN of/IN experts/NNS to/TO sift/VB through/IN 12,000/CD public/JJ suggestions/NNS ./.

The/DT current/JJ ruling/NN group/NN combines/VBZ the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS and/CC Social/NNP Democrats/NNS ,/, better/RBR known/VBN simply/RB as/IN the/DT Socialists/NNPS ./.

And/CC then/RB ,/, the/DT name/NN New/NNP Frontier/NNP Party/NNP is/VBZ n't/RB set/VBN in/IN stone/NN ./.

In/IN Japanese/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT ``/`` Shinshinto/NN ./. ''/''

Party/NNP public/NN information/NN chief/NN Yuriko/NNP Koike/NNP first/RB announced/VBD a/DT more/JJR literal/JJ translation/NN :/: ``/`` New/NNP Progressive/NNP Party/NNP ./. ''/''

A/DT few/JJ hours/NNS later/RB ,/, Koike/NNP settled/VBD on/IN ``/`` New/NNP Frontier/NNP Party/NNP ./. ''/''

She/PRP cautioned/VBD that/IN the/DT party/NN is/VBZ not/RB necessarily/RB linking/VBG itself/PRP with/IN John/NNP F./NNP Kennedy/NNP ,/, who/WP used/VBD ``/`` new/JJ frontier/NN ''/'' as/IN a/DT slogan/NN during/IN his/PRP$ presidential/JJ term/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ no/DT accident/NN that/IN all/DT five/CD names/NNS share/VBP a/DT certain/JJ vagueness/NNS about/IN what/WP the/DT new/JJ party/NN stands/VBZ for/IN ./.
