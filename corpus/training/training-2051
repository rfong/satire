Cambodian Demining Agency to Cut Staff Due to Lack of Fund
``The reduction of the staff will be started within a few months if
foreign aid is no longer provided,'' said an officer at Cambodian Mine
Action Center (CMAC).
The demining center spends about 13 million dollar a year to support
its work nationwide.
Over the last two years, foreign donors were reluctant to provide
further aid to CMAC after hearing corruption scandal in the body. But
lately, the audit has shown no loss of foreign fund, except
mismanagement in the body leading to a loss of some 75,000 dollars from
the government's fund.
CMAC is the government organization, but 90 percent of its fund is
depending on foreign donations from Japan, Australia, Britain, Sweden,
Belgium and Netherlands, etc.
It is estimated that 4 million to 6 million land mines were planted in
Cambodia since 1967.
45,000 Cambodian amputees are caused by land mines.
Meanwhile, CMAC has warned that the closure of the body will result in
negative impact to the development of community in the country.
