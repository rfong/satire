DPRK Demands Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from Northeast Asia 
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today demanded the
United States completely withdraw its military bases and troops out of
Japan and South Korea.
The demand came from a commentary published today in the Rodong Sinmun,
mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party of the DPRK, on the result of a
referendum held in Japan's southernmost island of Okinawa over the
future of the U.S. military bases in this prefecture.
About 90 percent of the Okinawans supported the idea to reduce the U.S.
military bases on the island. The commentary described the outcome as
only too natural, according to the DPRK's Korean Central News Agency
(KCNA).
The commentary said that the U.S. military bases and troops in Japan
have not only restricted Japan's sovereignty and inflicted a heavy
burden and misfortune on the Japanese people, but also intensified the
situation in northeast Asia and jeopardized peace and security in this
region.
Foreign military bases in northeast Asia are a result of the Cold War
and the withdrawal of the U.S. bases and troops after the end of the
Cold War is the call of the times, the article said.
It pointed out that the U.S. military bases and troops in South Korea
and Japan serve the U.S. policy of threatening of and aggression
against the DPRK and other Asian countries.
As long as these bases and troops remain in South Korea and Japan, the
people in this region will never lead a free and peaceful life, nor can
they expect a detente and a lasting peace in this part of the world,
the commentary warned.
If the United States has ever wanted to see an ease of tension and
peace in northeast Asia, the commentary said, it must take practical
measures to withdraw its aggression forces and military bases from
Japan and South Korea as soon as possible.
