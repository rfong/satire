UK Scientists Call for Wildlife Health Monitoring Scheme 
British scientists have called for establishing a wildlife health
monitoring scheme, saying that there is a clear need for a national
scheme to check the health of the country's wild creatures.
The call for such a national wildlife monitoring scheme is published in
the Veterinary Record, the journal of the British Veterinary
Association.
The scientists say the present approach is fragmented, and probably
misses many animal diseases, thus constituting a threat to the welfare
and conservation of wild species. It may also jeopardize the welfare of
domestic animals, and even human health.
The scientists are from the Zoological Society of London's Institute of
Zoology, and the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.
