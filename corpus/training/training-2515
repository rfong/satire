France's Vivendi and UK's Vodafone Set Up Alliance 
France's Vivendi group and UK's Vodafone Airtouch announced on Sunday
that they have set up a surprise alliance to create a European internet
portal and continent-wide fixed-line phone network.
The president of Vivendi Jean-Marie Messier and Vodafone chief
executive Chris Gent said at a surprise press conference here that
their ambition is to offer European consumers the possibility of
communicating by internet on a multitude of screens, television, mobile
phone and computers.
``With more than 70 million of European subscribers at the start,and
100 million very quickly, we will accelerate the passage of Europe to
the second generation (wireless) internet, and to present a brand which
will be stronger than all the `Yahoo' of the world,'' said Messier.
The alliance, which puts together the telecommunications networks owned
by Vodafone and many multimedia providers owned by Vivendi,could be a
counter action to the U.S. hyper-alliance of AOL-TimeWarner which will
create a world internet and communication giant.
Vodafone has investment in 25 countries in the five continents with 48
million customers and a mobile phone network in Europe with 34 million
subscribers.
Vivendi, the second largest telecoms company after France Telecom,has
7.2 mobile phone subscribers, 1 million fixed-line phone subscribers
and as well as 20 million subscribers in cable television and other
media firms in France and other European countries.
The two chief executives said that the starting scale of the alliance
will be ``impressing'' in Europe and will ``draw the whole world.''
The joint venture is also set to become an 80 percent investor in an
early stage ``wireless internet'' project.
The wireless internet can, for example, allow someone to communicate by
his television with another by his portable phone.
