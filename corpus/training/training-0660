U.S. Hoops All-Stars Beats Brazil 98-96 
Darryl Johnson outscored world top gun Oscar Schmidt 7-5 in a
two-men-show in the last two minutes, lifting the Klim All-Stars U.S.
team to a 98-96 cliff-hanger victory in the Beijing International
Basketball Challenge Friday.
The two side played neck-to-neck till the last 2:40 minutes when
Schmidt, the 38-year-old Brazilian shooter, broke the 91-91 tie with a
five-meter jumper. But Johnson, the former Michigan State university
guard, answered with a driving hook.
Schmidt, who will play his fifth Olympic Games 42-days later in
Atlanta, sank a three-pointer in the next Brazilian ball possesion with
1:45 minutes to go.
The 30-year-old Johnson also found the rim from behind the arc and tied
it 96-all for the Americans within one minutes to go.
Schmidt, who carried the Brazilian team with a game-high 37 points
including six 3-pointer bombs, missed his 14th attempt behind the arc
and Caio Silveira missed a tip on an open offensive rebound.
The Americans held the time down and Johnson hit the winning jumper
with only six seconds on the clock.
Mike Brown, a 2.11-meter former Chicago Bulls center, grabbed the ball
from Brazilian guard Conrado Ferraciu' hands in the dying seconds to
anchor the win for the Americans, who also won 105-84 over the Chinese
555 Team.
"The American team's defense are very tough and we lost a lot of
rebounds," said Brazilian coach Carlos Rodrigues after the game, in
which they lost 36-20 in rebounding against the Americans.
In the later game, the Chinese national team routed the Chinese 555
team 142-74 after leading the first half 79-47.

two teams entering the final and the other two teams for the third
place on Sunday.
