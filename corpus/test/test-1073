Tens of thousands flee from Zairean town 
Tens of thousands of people fled the east Zairean town of Uvira for the
south Friday as fighting raged between the Zairean army and ethnic
Tutsis fighting government troops, aid officials said here.
"A large proportion of the local people and of the Zairean army have
fled as the Banyamulenge advance," said the sources, who were still in
touch with Uvira, only 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the Burundian
capital Bujumbura.
The Banyamulenge are ethnic Tutsis of Rwandan origin who have been
resident in Zaire since pre-colonial times.
The sources could not confirm or deny that the rebels had taken Uvira
but said this was probable. If Uvira was captured it would be the
biggest town to come under rebel control.
The Banyamulenge shelled Uvira overnight Thursday until midday Friday
before entering parts of the town, which lies at the northwest end of
Lake Tanganyika.
Uvira refugees were heading south along the lake and some reached the
village of Fizi but only a few found refuge in neighboring Burundi.
