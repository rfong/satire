Virus scare shuts down schools, creches and faculties in Greece 
Greece announced Tuesday it was closing down all its schools,
universities and baby care centres for three days because of a deadly
virus that affects the heart and has already killed three people.
Since last Thursday, the health ministry has recorded 19 cases of the
virus, which targets the heart and respiratory system, Health Minister
Alekos Papadopoulos told journalists.
"Hospitals are on a state of alert to cope with the virus," which has
killed three women, two of them on the island of Crete.
The virus is characterised by flu-like symptoms before myocarditis
takes hold, health services said.
"While children are not particularly susceptible to the virus, they can
easily carry it," the health ministry warned.
"We cannot yet say whether there is an epidemic before we have finished
investigating the virus, which we expect to do in the coming days,"
Papadopoulos said.
Of a total of 32 reported cases, four were among children and 13 in the
capital Athens, the minister said.
