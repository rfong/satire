Woman Survives World's Longest Heart Beat Stop 
The Shanghai-based office of Guinness Book of World Records recently
certified that a Chinese woman survived the longest period of cardiac
arrest in the history of surgery worldwide.
Luo Qiulian, a resident of Central China's Hunan Province, survived
cardiac arrest for two and a half hours during heart surgery in
December 1997.
Ventricular tachycardia during an operation at the Provincial People's
Hospital triggered the cardiac arrest. Luo's heartbeat returned to
normal after over two hours of emergency treatment.
Luo, a farmer in Yuxian County, has regained her health and returned to
work, with no indications of sequelae.
The new world record was confirmed and entered into the book following
the normal one-year confirmation process.
