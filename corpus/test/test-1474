OIC hopes Rabin's killing will not damage peace process 
The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) said on Monday that it
hoped the Middle East peace process would continue after the
assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
The 51-member pan-Islamic body, based in Saudi Arabia's Red Sea port of
Jeddah, said it condemned "all forms of terrorism whatever their
origin."
Hamid Algabid, the OIC's general secretary, expressed "the hope that
this event will not constitute an obstacle to the peace process, which
has the support of the international community and the OIC."
Three other organizations in the region have also condemned the killing
of Rabin in Tel Aviv on Saturday by a Jewish extremist: the Gulf
Cooperation Council, the Arab League and the Organization of African
Unity.
