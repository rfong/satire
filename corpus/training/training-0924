Argentina Detains Man with Cocaine 
Argentina's antidrug police Saturday detained at an airport a man who
carried cocaine in the stomach, said official sources.
The 30-year-old man, who had in his stomach 80 capsules of cocaine, was
arrested in an operation when passengers were boarding on a commercial
flight bound for Miami, the United States from the Ezeiza International
Airport in the suburbs of Buenos Aires.
The Federal Police Dangerous Drugs Division said that the man was taken
to a public hospital, where he was given a treatment to expel the
capsules.
Police sources said that the arrested passenger is a member of an
international drug trafficking network that is engaged in trafficking
cocaine to the United States and Europe.
