Aussie subdues giant killer 
Australian No. 2 seed Liz Irving ended England youngster Linda
Charman's giant-killing exploits at the women's world open squash
championships here Thursday.
Irving reached the quarter-finals with a 9-0,9-6,5-9,9-6 victory over
the 22-year-old from Sussex who on Wednesday eliminated Guernsey's
former world champion Martine Le Moignan.
Another former world champion, Australia's Vicki Cardwell, was also
eliminated Thursday.
The 39-year-old from Melbourne went down 4-9, 4-9, 0-9 to England's
Cassie Jackman whose quarter-final opponent will be Cardwell's
compatriot Carol Owens.
The Melbourne-based Owens made short work of England's Jane Martin in
the third round on Thursday, winning 9-3, 9-1, 9-4.
