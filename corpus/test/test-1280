Bank Of England Pumps Money Into Pubs To Ease Concern In The City
The Bank Of England governor Mervyn King today announced a massive
U-turn as he confirmed that the independent bank would pump £10 billion
into London Pubs to ease fears in the city.
The £10 billion has been put behind the bars of 1000 London pubs in an
attempt to relieve tensions in the city and increase the banks
likelihood of lending to each other because they are all pissed. This
is also likely to lead to drunken bankers revealing the extent to which
they are exposed to the bad debts from the US sub prime mortgage
crisis.
In an attempt to calm the storm he also repeatedly referred to this as
the 'Pub Prime Solution'. Breweries all over the South East are now
rushing supplies to the square mile in expectation of a massive rise in
consumption.
