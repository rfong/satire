US, Qatar begin joint military exercises 
Qatar and the United States began joint military exercises here
Wednesday after the arrival about 35 US warplanes and fuel tankers,
officials announced.
Security measures have been beefed up around compounds housing US
military personnel to prevent any terrorist attacks after the truck
bombing last week that killed 19 American airforce servicemen at the El
Khobar air base in eastern Saudi Arabia, they added.
More than 1,000 US pilots, service personnel and technicians are taking
part in the exercises with Qatari soldiers, which will continue through
August 13.
General Lance Smith, commander of the US forces participating in the
exercises, said they were aimed at improving the combat ability of
Qatari and allied forces in the Gulf region.
The United States announced in May that it would deploy 34 fighter
aircraft in Qatar as part of the mission enforcing the no-fly zone over
southern Iraq, set up to protect Kurdish refugees.
The military agreement was signed by US Defense Secretary William Perry
and Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad ibn Jassem ibn Jabr Al-Thani,
said deputy US defense secretary Bruce Riedel.
Qatar and the United States are linked by a military cooperation
accord, allowing the US to use military facilities in the Gulf country
and station supplies and equipment here.
According to US sources in Doha, tanks, armored personnel carriers and
trucks are stationed in Qatar.
Under accords signed with various Gulf countries, the United States has
21,000 troops stationed in the oil-rich region, 75 percent of them on
22 navy ships.
