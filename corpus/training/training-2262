29 Moslem fundamentalists killed in Algerian violence 
Twenty-nine Moslem fundamentalists have been killed in security force
operations in the past week, Algerian security services said Saturday.
The latest toll brings to 285 the number of Moslem militants killed
since the beginning of May, according to Algerian press reports.
Nineteen were killed on Thursday alone in five separate incidents.
The security services said a number of weapons were also seized during
the operations.
The civil war has cost the lives of an estimated 30,000 people in three
years of fighting. The violence erupted in January 1992 when the
government cancelled a vote that Moslem candidates had been expected to
win.
