Mandela Rules Out Mediating on Congo Civil War 
South African president Nelson Mandela today ruled out mediating in the
civil war in the Republic of Congo.
Asked by reporters in Cape Town whether South Africa would be willing
to help in resolving the conflict, Mandela said there were existing
structures to address those issues.
Both parties involved in the conflict in Congo had wanted to visit
South Africa about two months ago to consult Mandela, but he had
refused and referred them to Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, who is
chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).
"He is the man they should put their problems to," said Mandela.
"I did not think it would be correct--so soon after i'd been involved
in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo--to be involved in a
neighbouring country,"he added.
According to reports reaching here earlier today, forces backing
Congo's former military strongman, Denis Sassou Nguesso, had seized
control of the centre of the main oil town and port, Pointe-Noire.
A spokesman for Nguesso's democratic and popular forces, speaking from
the Gabonese capital Libreville, said the movement's troops had
captured Pointe-Noire's airport, and resistance by forces loyal to
president Lissouba was expected to end towards midday.
