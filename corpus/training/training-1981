Spitzer an Opus Dei laughingstock says NATO
NATO top brass are having a right laugh.
Eliot Spitzer's spectacular fall from grace has left them cock-a-hoop,
"especially all those NYC hookers' bumper-stickers saying Who's the
biggest whore of all, Eliot?"
All day long the corks have been popping in NATO High Command.
Not since KGB/Mossad/CIA harlot Robert Maxwell decided to go moonlight
skinny-dipping in the Med have NATO generals felt so giddy-happy.
"His face looks like one of those 'I've-just-eaten-my-own-vomit'
smiley/emoticons," Field Marshall General Sir Ainsley McThermite
chuckled today.
"We've had literally years of fun cooking up this honeytrap."
Meanwhile back in Albany the ex-Gov is spitting venom.
"For all that massive intellect, enormous savvy and mind-boggling
near-psychic powers of observation he knows he's walked straight into a
huge pile of cack," said the gubernatorial residency janitor.
