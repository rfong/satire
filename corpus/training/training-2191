China to Hold Fifth Arts Festival in Sichuan 
China will hold its fifth Arts Festival this October in Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan province in southwest China.
The biennial event is the biggest showcase of China's artistic
achievements. It aims to promote folk culture and improve the national
spirit, local officials commented.
"Sichuan is the hometown of Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of
China's reform and opening up drive. It will be of special significance
for the festival to be held there," said Xu Shiqun, deputy governor of
Sichuan.
Deng passed away in February this year.
The festival will also be an event to mark the return of Hong Kong to
the motherland as well as the convening of the Party's 15th Congress
later this year.
Pan Zhenzhou, deputy minister of culture, said that the themes of this
year's festival will be "patriotism, unity, and prosperity".
Mass gatherings, dance and song performances at city squares will be
held, and artists from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan will be invited to
give performances, Pan said.
The Sichuan government hopes that the festival will help improve the
province's image and attract more attention and capital.
