I'll keep on, says Papandreou, 76 
Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou denied Sunday that he was too
infirm to continue governing, and urged would-be successors to wait
their turn to replace him.
He also rebutted allegations that his 41-year-old wife was playing an
unwarranted political role. "I'm the one who's in charge," he said.
"They'll have to wait a little longer," Papandreou, 76, said of those
clamouring for his political retirement, at a press conference in
Thessalonika. "I am ready to battle on for a long time.
"It is a mistake to say that I am ill, or that I cannot carry out my
functions," said Papandreou, who is also leader of the Socialist Party
(PASOK).
The premier is habitually accused by the opposition and the right-wing
press of being physically incapable of governing, but of late has seen
a phantom power struggle grip his own party as putative successors
jostle for position.
He has also been accused of "co-governing" with his wife, Dimitra
Liani.
His statement to the contracy brought enthusiastic applause from
members of his cabinet at the press conference.
Papandreou nevertheless admitted that his spouse did have "a natural
disposition for politics."
