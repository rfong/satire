Khatami Urges West to See Iran as Partner for Dialog 
Visiting Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said Wednesday that Europe
and the United States should regard Iran not as an object for study but
as a partner for dialog on an equal footing.
Speaking at the European University Institute in the Italian central
city of Florence, Khatami said the dialog he envisions would not be
possible with "those who feel they have an exclusive hold on the
truth."
Only dialog on an equal basis will allow the West and Iran to
contribute to the construction of peace, security and justice, he said.
He said that 20 years after the Iranian revolution, he has come to
Europe as the representative of "a civilization" which is needed in
achieving a global balance.
Khatami, on second day of the first visit to Europe by an Iranian
leader since the 1979 overthrow of the Shah, also noted that his call
for dialog in his message to Europe was not unilateral.
He praised Italy as a model for tolerance which he has in mind for
underpinning mutual understanding and dialog.
