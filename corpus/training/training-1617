US Factory Orders Up 1.2 Percent in April 
Orders to U.S. factories increased by 1.2 percent in April, the third
rise in four months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
The department said that the factory orders increase to a seasonally
adjusted 323.9 billion dollars in the month. The gain followed a 1.3
percent drop in March and increases of 0.4 percent in February and 2.5
percent in January.
Orders for durable goods -- items expected to last three or more years
-- were up by 1.3 percent. There was a 1 percent rise in non-durable
goods, the first increase in three months.
Shipments of manufactured goods, a measure of current production, also
increased by 1.2 percent in April, the largest in a year. It resulted
in a 0.3 percent decline in the backlog of unfilled orders, the second
consecutive drop and same as in March.
The report said that new orders for volatile transportation equipment
rose by 3.4 percent, the first increase since January. Orders for
industrial machinery rose 2.7 percent, the fifth consecutive increase.
However, a slump in communications equipment and electronic components
pulled orders for electronic and electrical equipment 5.7 percent
lower.
The greatest strength in non-durable goods was registered by chemicals,
apparel and paper products
Factory orders in the U.S. are closely followed by economists as a
barometer of future production. If production fails to keep up with the
pace of new orders, it's a sign that inflationary bottlenecks could be
developing in the production pipeline.
