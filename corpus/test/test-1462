The mayor returned triumphantly to office after serving nearly six
months in jail. He blamed his troubles with the law on his political
enemies who, threatened by his power, had set out to get him. But now,
the mayor was as powerful as before.
That sounds like the story of Marion S. Barry, who last week staged one
of the most audacious comebacks in political history: four years after
the former Mayor of the District of Columbia was caught on videotape
smoking crack and convicted on drug charges, he won the Democratic
Mayoral primary.
But it is the story of James Michael Curley, who was a Mayor of Boston
in the early 1900s and one of the most resilient politicians of his
time. Despite several brushes with the law, including his conviction
for mail fraud, Curley was elected mayor four times over four decades.
Barry's nomination, which almost insures his election, is the latest in
a rich, yet quirky, American tradition of elected officials disgracing
their offices and then turning their transgressions to political
advantage. Like Mr. Curley, Barry did not apologize for his offenses.
Both blamed their predicaments on the established power structure.
Curley, the tribune of Irish immigrants, lashed out at the prominent
Brahmins of Beacon Hill; Barry's venom was at the white power
institutions that he said plotted to bring him down.
``There's a striking similarity in their appeals,'' said Jack Beatty,
author of a biography of Curley, ``The Rascal King'' (Addison-Wesley,
1992). ``Both had a grasp for the politics of revenge; striking back at
the respectable people, at the people who haven't been to jail, at the
people who are outraged that this affront to the municipal
consciousness should still be on the stage.''
But history shows that lack of discretion, or downright flouting of the
law, does not always kill a political career. A term in jail, as Barry
and Curley demonstrated, can be worn like a badge of courage.
Representative Thomas J. Lane, a Democrat from Lawrence, Mass., was the
first congressman re-elected, in 1956, after serving jail time -- four
months for tax evasion. Voters did not seem to mind his criminal record
because, like Barry and Curley, he was known for tending to the
concerns of constituents.
Another congressman who, like Lane, died earlier this year was Rep.
Daniel J. Flood, a debonair Democrat from northeastern Pennsylvania who
was known for his villainous-looking mustache. To some, he was a crook
who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1980. But he was a hero to the coal
miners and flood victims in his district. Though forced to resign after
his guilty plea, Flood was re-elected between two trials.
Barry's resurrection is also reminiscent of the case of Rep. Adam
Clayton Powell Jr., who was charged several times but never convicted.
His fellow members of Congress excluded him for assorted financial
improprieties, but the voters thought otherwise and re-elected him.
David S. Bositis, a senior analyst for the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies, said that Powell's constituents cared more about
what he could do for them than his own legal troubles.
``People do not elect their leaders to be upright,'' Bositis said.
``They want them to do something. If someone serves in office for 20
years and all they can say is they're honest, you can also say they
were a lousy, ineffective leader.''
An important reason that Barry prevailed was that among the poor and
disenfranchised, he was remembered as an effective leader. His two
major opponents, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly and Councilman John Ray, are
both black, but they were viewed by poor blacks as too close to the
white power structure. Of the three, only Barry was active in the civil
rights movement, and only he was viewed as an advocate for the poor.
Like Curley, Barry is known for appealing to peoples' self-interest;
both reached out to help the down-and-out, even if it meant bloating
the city budget with patronage appointments and public works jobs.
Paul Costello, a former communications director for Kelly, said Barry's
drug conviction is not startling to voters in poor neighborhoods to
whom drug arrests are a daily part of life; and they think he was set
up anyway.
``So he went to jail for smoking crack; he gave my kid a summer job, he
provided a job in city government for my parents, he touched my
grandparent at a senior center,'' Costello said. ``He enables people in
the poorest, most devastated part of the city to believe in someone.
But I think it's a charade.''
Charade or not, it seems to be working. Perhaps in an era when people
are more contemptuous of their politicians than ever, voters have
developed a new sense of morality: Since they are all bad, I'll vote
for the politician who can do the most for me. In the case of Barry's
supporters, it may not be so much a matter of forgiveness as much as a
refusal to forgive the powers-that-be for doing him in.
Another recent comeback was made by Rep. Daniel J. Rosentkowski, the
influential Chicago Democrat. Despite his indictment for defrauding the
government, Rostenkowski managed to win a contentious primary early
this year. It was not because people were certain of his innocence, but
because what mattered most was that Rostenkowski had a record of
dispensing pork to his district.
On the other end of the political spectrum, Oliver L. North, in his bid
for Senate from Virginia, is playing the same politics. He has refused
to apologize for the Iran-Contra scandal, and instead has lashed out at
the power structure in Washington -- Democrats and Republicans -- for
conspiring against him. The message clearly has some appeal -- at least
enough that North won the Republican nomination to take on Sen. Charles
S. Robb in November.
Just as Barry's supporters overlooked his drug conviction, North's
supporters overlooked his admission that he lied to Congress -- and
prefer to focus on his talk of shaking up Washington and ending the
Democratic hold on Congress. Todd Wilkowski, a 27-year-old student, put
it this way after hearing North speak at a rally in Norfolk, last week:
``Sometimes, you have to follow orders.''
