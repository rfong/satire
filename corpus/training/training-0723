Russia, Belarus push monetary union further 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his Belarus counterpart
Vyacheslav Kebich signed an agreement Sunday pushing further a proposed
monetary union between the two former Soviet republics.
The two governments must now agree by the end of July on a mechanism
for the currency union, agreed in principle in April.
The union would bring the Russian ruble back to the independent
republic of Belarus, under the control of the Russian central bank. The
Belarus currency voucher is currently worth about a tenth of the ruble.
"The Belarus (central) bank will issue Russian rubles on (its)
territory within limits fixed by the Russian bank," Moscow bank chief
Viktor Gerashchenko said in the Belarus capital.
The Russian government is generally eager to regain influence over a
former part of the Soviet empire, but also fears that the union with a
struggling Belarus might increase inflationary pressure on Russia's
economy.
The two premiers also signed an agreement giving Belarus 22 billion
rubles (11 million dollars) to aid victims of the nuclear reactor
explosion at Chernobyl in neighbouring Ukraine eight years ago.
The Russian visit to Belarus fell in the middle of a presidential
campaign, with populist deputy Alexander Lukashenko favourite to beat
Kebich in the second round of voting next Sunday.
Chernomyrdin met Lukashenko for a brief talk, the agency Interfax
reported.
