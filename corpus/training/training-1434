Lebanese President Pays Landmark Visit to Jordan 
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud arrived in Amman Saturday for a visit,
the first by a Lebanese head of state to Jordan since the 1950s.
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein met with Lahoud and they discussed
economic and political issues of mutual concern, the situation in south
Lebanon and other regional issues, Jordan's Petra news agency said.
The two leaders also discussed the coordination of Arab efforts in the
Middle East peace process after Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak
emerged as the prime minister-elect in the May 17 elections.
Lahoud's trip to Amman came after Abdullah's fence-mending visit to
Syria in April which saw relations between Amman and Damascus warming
up after four years of strains.
Ties between Jordan, Syria and Lebanon soured in 1994 when Jordan
signed a peace treaty with Israel.
After Abdullah's visit to Damascus, Jordan has reiterated its support
for Syria's stand to resume peace talks with Israel.
Damascus said the peace talks should resume from where they were
suspended before the Israeli Likud Party came to power in 1996, and
called on Israel to withdraw its troops from the Golan Heights and
south Lebanon.
