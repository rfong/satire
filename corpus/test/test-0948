Rwandan President, EU Special Envoy Hold Talks on Conflicts in Congo 
Aldo Ajello, visiting European Union Special Envoy to the Great Lakes
region, Tuesday held talks with Rwandan President Paul Kagame primarily
on the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda
News Agency reported Wednesday.
During the talks, "President Kagame briefed Ambassador Ajello on the
recent meeting of the Political Committee for the implementation of the
Cease-fire Agreement in the DRC," Kagame's Press Secretary Nicholas
Shalita said in a statement Wednesday.
Kagame reiterated Rwanda's commitment to full implementation of the
Lusaka peace accord. Ajello indicated that the EU will continue to
support the Lusaka peace process as it enters the crucial third phase
of the implementation.
Ajello specifically expressed the EU's support for the inter- Congolese
dialogue which he said must be completed ahead of the withdrawal of all
foreign forces from the DRC.
According to the news agency, the EU special envoy also hailed the
initiative by the Rwandan government for organizing solidarity camps
for the captured former rebels.
"The ex-rebels are being treated well and were happy to have returned
home," Ajello told reporters during his visit to a resettlement camp
for former rebels in the northwestern province of Gisenyi.
The initiative to reeducate and resettle the former militiamen was an
excellent one which would demonstrate to other rebels still fighting
that there is no point in their cause, Ayello stressed.
