Chinese NPC Vice-Chairman Meets French Guests 
Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC), met with Jean Matteoli, chairman of
the Economic and Social Council of France (ESC), and his party here
today.
Matteoli and other French guests, now visiting China as guest of the
NPC Financial and Economic Committee, attended a three-day Sino-French
Symposium from September 16 to 18 on the State-Owned Assets Management
in Shanghai, the third of its kind ever held.
Wang noted that participants conducted in-depth discussions on the
management of state-owned assets as well as the reform of state-owned
enterprises, and set forth many valuable suggestions, which are
beneficial for both sides.
He highly praised the sound co-operation between the ESC of France and
the FEC of the Chinese NPC.
Meanwhile, Matteoli spoke highly of the very successful discussions
between the French participants and their Chinese colleagues during the
symposium. The ESC has done some work for promoting French-Chinese
relations, and will continue to do so, he said.
