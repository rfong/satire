Business Inventories Up 0.7 Percent 
U.S. business inventories rose 0.7 percent in November, the eighth
straight gain, matching the revised increase for the previous month.
The Commerce Department also reported Wednesday that sales climbed a
strong 1 percent in November after advancing 0.3 percent in October.
Analysts expected the November inventory gain, given last year's robust
buying pace. But they said leaner stockpiles may be ahead if consumer
spending slows.
Last week, the government said retail sales -- about a third of all
sales -- declined 0.1 percent in December in what analysts said could
be a sign the spending spree that has driven the four-year economic
expansion is easing.
The Commerce Department said Wednesday inventories totaled a seasonally
adjusted dlrs 919.8 billion in November, up from dlrs 913.4 billion.
Inventories in November were 6.2 percent higher than a year earlier.
The 0.7 percent increase in inventories in October was revised upward
from an earlier 0.4 percent estimate.
Stockpiles have now risen in 10 of the last 11 months, slipping in
March by 0.2 percent for their only decline.
The inventory buildup in November was led by big-ticket durable goods,
which increased 0.8 percent from October and were 7.9 percent higher
than a year earlier.
Sales in November were at a seasonally adjusted dlrs 658.4 billion, up
from dlrs 651.9 billion. They were 8.5 percent higher than a year
earlier.
The inventory-to-sales ratio remained at 1.40 -- barely up from its
historic low of 1.39 in August. That means it would take 1.40 months to
exhaust stockpiles at the November sales rate.
The ratio is normally a sign of economic strength, since any growth in
sales likely would lead to new orders to replenish shelves and
backlots.
Because of the strength in sales last year, inventories have stayed at
historically low levels even as they have accumulated rapidly.
Retail inventories rose to dlrs 294.7 billion in November from dlrs
293.1 billion. Stockpiles at the wholesale level were up to dlrs 235.1
billion from dlrs 232.2 billion. Manufacturers' inventories rose to
dlrs 390 billion from dlrs 388.1 billion.
Business sales in November at the retail level were at dlrs 192.1
billion, up from dlrs 191.8 billion. At the wholesale level, they fell
to dlrs 176 billion from dlrs 176.2 billion. Factory sales rose to dlrs
290.4 billion from dlrs 284 billion.
