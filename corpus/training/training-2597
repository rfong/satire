Northern Crock fiasco: Bank of England Governor is victim of credit card ID
fraud
The Governor of the Bank of England said today that he has become the
latest credit card ID fraud victim after somebody cloned his identity,
obtained over £60 billion "and gave it all away to the Northern Crock
Bank."
Mervyn King, 69, said he is absolutely livid.
"Somebody rang up the Bangalore-based Bank of England call-centre, gave
my name and password, schmoozed the telephone staff and obtained a
replacement BoE credit card within 24 hours," King said today.
"And what's more they even got a 1,000% increase on my credit limit.
Can you believe it?
"But what really takes the biscuit is they asked for the card to be
sent to my supposed 'new' London address at No 10 Drowning Street,
Whitehole.
"I ask you."
