Israeli army spy master sees progress towards peace with Syria 
Peace negotiations with Syria will soon make progress, the head of
Israeli military intelligence, General Uri Saguy said Monday.
President Hafez al-Assad "understands the meaning of peace," Saguy told
state radio.
"The talks will soon register progress because Israel and Syria have
reached the conclusion that there is no other alternative," he said.
"It appeared in president Assad's speech to parliament on Saturday in
Damascus that Syria will do all it can to find a solution for the peace
process.
"President Assad understands the meaning of peace. He knows that he
have to have normal relations and detailed security arrangements."
However he recognized the existence of a "a deep psychological gulf
between Israel and Syria which has to be bridged".
Saguy nonetheless warned of "Syria's continued efforts to strengthen
its armed forces. Syria has not given up on other options and remains
the leading Arab country in the arms race."
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres hailed Assad's speech as a "declaration
of peace" and called for a new approach to find an accord with Syria.
"In previous times we used to hear declarations of war," Peres said
Sunday.
"The solution does not lie in the Israeli or Syrian position, but in a
third position which should be agreed."
Assad said Syria was "aware of the objective requirements of peace and
is ready to conform to the requirements on which an accord will be
based."
Assad stressed that Syria "was aware of the importance of a peace which
guarantees a total retreat".
"We will do our best to allow that hope to flourish," he said, adding
that Syria had informed the US administration of its "willingness" to
continue with the peace process.
Syria wants an Israeli pledge for total withdrawal, while Israel wants
a Syrian commitment to total peace before detailing the scope of
withdrawal.
