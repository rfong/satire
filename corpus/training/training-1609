Police seize Kurdish separatist propaganda in Germany 
Police on Saturday seized separatist Kurdish propaganda at a raid here
on a centre for asylum seekers and detained 16 people for questioning.
More than 700 policemen stormed the centre and seized material
belonging to the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) -- banned in
both Germany and Turkey -- during the raid on the centre, believed to
be a PKK office.
The party, which is considered a terrorist group in Germany, has been
banned there since November 1993.
