Seven Injured in California School Shooting
The shooting happened at approximately 12:54 p.m. Pacific time at
Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, near San Diego,when a gunman
with shaved head got out of a car to begin firing with a shotgun,
witnesses were quoted by the local TV station KGTV as saying.
Six people, including one female teacher, reportedly suffered gunshot
wounds. One of the victims -- a 15-year-old male -- was wounded in the
upper chest by shotgun pellets and was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital
for surgery.
Three other people were also sent into local hospitals for treatment of
shock, shortness of breath or hyperventilating, including one
51-year-old father who complained about chest pains after running to
the school to check on his kid.
Hospital sources said that none of the injuries were considered
life-threatening.
Two policemen were on duty on the campus at the time of shooting, and
they immediately engaged in a shootout with the gunman, who was later
wounded in the mouth and buttocks, police said.
The gunman was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital for treatment, and his
wounds are neither life-threatening, a hospital spokeswoman said.
Chris Wesley, a junior at Granite Hills, told KGTV that he recognized
the shooter as a former student who graduated from the school last
year. The gunman fired at least eight shots and reloaded his weapon
during the shooting, Wesley said.
There are about 2,800 people in the school. The school will be closed
Friday pending the police investigation into the shooting.
The cause of the shooting, the second in San Diego in the past month,
remained unknown. The Granite Hills High School is just nine miles away
from the Santana High School, where two people were killed and 13
others wounded early the month in a shooting rampage by a male student.
