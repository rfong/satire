First Quarter Saw 31 Major Fires in China 
China suffered 31 major fires in the January-April period this year,
resulting in 75 deaths and 58 people injured, according to the Ministry
of Public Security today.
The direct property loss amounted to 110 million yuan (13.3 million US
dollars), 2.7 times the figure for the same period in 1997, according
to the statistics.
Major causes of this year's major fires were violations of safety rules
and careless use of fire, electricity and gas.
The ministry pointed out that many fires broke out in public places,
oil and chemical industry locations, and other places where
combustibles and explosive substances were stored.
Besides, most people still have a poor awareness of fire prevention and
precautions in case of fire, the ministry noted.
Concerning the major fires this year, the ministry has issued a
circular and set out concrete requirements and measures as regards fire
fighting.
The Law on Fire Control was adopted by the second meeting of the
Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress on April 29
and will go into effect September 1 this year.
The ministry urged local governments to attach great importance to
firefighting work and improve firefighting facilities.
In addition, the general public must be made more aware of the
importance of fire safety, it noted.
