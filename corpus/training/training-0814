Nyerere Urges Developing Countries To Control Economy 
Tanzanian former President Julius Nyerere has cautioned against
wholesale adoption of poli- cies influencing developing countries'
governments to abdicate control of their economies and leave things to
the private sector and whims of market forces.
Addressing journalists here on Tuesday, Nyerere said unlike in the
west, the private sector in developing countries needed protection and
nursing.
Nyerere, Chairman of the South Center, said the widely advocated
concept was at best deceptive, because governments in the west had not
abdicated the role of economic control and protecting their own
interests.
"I understand the industrialised countries -- the so-called Group of
Seven -- would meet somewhere in the near future. The agenda will be
the economy -- I am sure they will not sit and simply drink tea
together -- but talk business.
"Mind you, those who will be meeting at the G-7 summit will not be the
businessmen but prime ministers and presidents. Why should they meet if
everything is supposed to be left to market forces?" he asked.
The former president said he was much in support of trade
liberalisation and free global trade as a concept, but wanted it to be
guided by equity.
"Players are supposed to be on an equal footing for the bout to be
fair," he said. "A heavyweight cannot fight with the lightweight (in
boxing match). It will be unfair. Then why can't they see the same
logic in economics," he said.
Apparently stressing the need for a fair global economic order, a coure
he has always cherished, nyerere appealed for north-south cooperation
to boost prosperity of the mankind.
He said opening up for international competition without first
assessing the capacity of entity involved, could lead to disastrous
outcome with the poor getting even more poorer.
