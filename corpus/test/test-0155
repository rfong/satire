Fur flies as royal hairdresser branded rabid nutter
Camilla's £300-a-snip London hairdresser Daniel Galvin Jr has been branded
a rabid nutter by disgruntled neighbors who told a judge on Friday that the
posturing egomaniacal coiffure is "like a little Hitler trying to invade
everywhere."
"Well that should suit his current royal family clients very well," was
the unexpected reply, "given that the Duchess of Cornwall's paternal
grandfather was the Nazi traitor Von Ribbentrop.
"And that her blood-father is the Hellfire Club & Tory Grandee Sir
Geoffrey 'Mogadon-Man' Howe!" learned counsel added, nodding sagely.
Standing in the dock Galvin Jr admitted escalating a land-grab property
war with his neighbors the Bury brothers and going hammer and curling
tong against them to snatch back a ten foot wide piece of arable track.
David and Richard Bury have testified that Galvin Jr "is a complete
nutter, a toss-pot full of steaming cow-shit, a living nightmare and
just like a rabid dog."
Pleasantries aside, the Bury's yesterday won substantial compensation
from the dodgy hairdresser after the court found him guilty of shooting
at the brothers with his air rifle, hurling rocks at their tractor
shattering their windows and sabotaging their crops.
Speaking to reporters after the trial David Bury said:
"He's behaved like a right thug, regardless of whose bloody royal hair
he sees to.
"Mind you, judging what Camilla ends up looking after forking out
hundreds of quid for her weekly makeover at his salon, I'd say he's
more into demanding money with menaces from his clients that actually
doing anything trichological for them."
