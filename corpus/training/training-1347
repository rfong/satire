Philippine Police Lists 364 Election "Hot Spots" 
The Philippine National Police (PNP) has identified 364 election "hot
spots" nationwide in the coming May elections, PNP Director General
Santiago Alino said Thursday.
Alino said most of these election hot spots are located in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines.
He said among the factors considered in declaring the areas election
hot spots are: New People's Army (NPA), Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) influence, intensity of partisan politics and past history
particularly violent incidents.
The NPA is the military wing of the leftist rebel group, the National
Democratic Front (NDF) led by the Communist Party of the Philippines.
The MILF is currently the largest anti-government Muslim separatist
force in the country.
Alino said that hotly contested areas are also potential sources of
trouble during the elections.
Advance deployment of PNP men in these hot spots had been made to
thwart the eruption of violence and other related election-troubles, he
said.
According to Alino, the Commission on Election (Comelec), which has
been informed of the election hot spots, will finally identify and
declare which among the 364 election hot spots are to be put under
Comelec-military control.
Under the constitution, Filipino voters will elect the president, the
vice president, half of the 24-member Senate, all 250 members of the
lower house, and local government officials in the May 11 general
polls.
