US tourists in Italy face terror threat with calm 
The "credible threat" of a terrorist attack on Americans in four
Italian cities this weekend has sent a shudder through Italy's tourism
industry, but did not appear to affect Americans visiting Rome early
Thursday.
"It does get to you a little bit but at the same time, you don't want
to stay in a hole. You want to get out. You gotta live, right?" said
Mark Byrd, 39, who is travelling with his family.
"Unless it is a very serious threat it wouldn't stop me from
travelling. I travel to Europe for my company and after 9/11 I was on
one of the first flights out of the US," Byrd, of Philidelphia, told
AFP as his family mingled with the crowd outside the Colosseum.
However, the news of a terror alert dampened the spirits of Marcus
Sharar, 27, and Stacie Bennett, 27, of San Fransisco.
They were unaware of the alert circulated by the US embassy in Rome
late on Wednesday, warning Americans visiting Florence, Milan, Verona
and Venice of a "credible" threat of an attack.
Sharar and Bennett were due to spend Easter Sunday in Florence but
won't be tempting fate, they said.
"Of course, a threat like that would alter our plans," said Marcus.
"If it appears there's a real threat then we definitely aren't going to
go," said Stacie.
"After 9/11 we put off this trip off a little bit," said Marcus, who
says the couple may now head for Spain.
"At first I was a bit nervous about coming," said Stacie.
Another man dragging his family around Rome's ancient sites said
simply: "it doesn't bother me," adding that he lived in Europe and that
security alerts would not alter his plans.
Some Americans at the Colosseum were showing signs of defensiveness,
however. One man said at first that he was British when asked if he was
American, despite a strong American drawl.
"Yeah, we heard about the threat. But we're going where we want to go.
We won't let anyone change our plans," he said, declining to give his
name.
