China's Investment in Industry on Steady Growth 
China's investment in many industrial sectors rose steadily in the
first four months of 2000, but input in construction dropped
substantially, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

industry between January and April increased 8.6 percent year on year
to 119.90 billion yuan (about 14.5 billion U. S. dollars).
During this period, 66.24 billion yuan went to the energy sector,
surging 15.0 percent over the same period of 1999, and a sum of 14.76
billion yuan was directed to light industry and textile, up 9.6
percent.
Investment in machinery and electronics at the time reached 414. 54
billion yuan, up 8.6 percent on an annual basis.
The construction sector suffered a decline of investment with funds
channeled to this field amounting to 2.19 billion yuan, falling 11.0
percent year on year.
