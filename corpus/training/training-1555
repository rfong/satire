Philippines launches massive British-funded bridge-building program 
President Fidel Ramos on Tuesday launched a British-funded project to
quickly set up 218 British-made bridges in different rural areas of the
Philippines.
The project, which will cost some 1.4 billion pesos (53.8 million
dollars) involves the construction of the pre-fabricated steel bridges
by Filipino engineers working with the British firm, Mabey and Johnson.
Ramos said, at the opening of the first of the bridges in the province
of Bulacan, just outside Manila, that the project was 35-percent
financed by a British grant while 65-percent will come from a long-term
loan from the British government.
A British embassy statement said that the British government would pay
for the bridges while the Philippine government would pay for support
structures.
The first bridge was constructed in just four days the embassy said,
adding that they expected the other bridges to be completed at the rate
of one bridge per day.
Ramos said that the bridge project would spur economic growth in the
countryside by making it easier for farmers to deliver their products
to market.
