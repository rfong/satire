No confidence vote against Yilmaz set for Saturday 
The Turkish parliament decided Monday to hold a vote of no confidence
against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' conservative government Saturday.
The decision came after Yilmaz' former coalition partner Tansu Ciller
withdrew her support from the government in late May following a
weeks-long power struggle between the two leaders.
