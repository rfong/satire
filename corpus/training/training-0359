EU Envoy Urges Ethiopia, Eritrea to Normalize Relations 
Signor Rino Serri, envoy of the European Union (EU) parliament to the
Horn of Africa, has urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to normalize their
relations before the demarcation of borders, the Ethiopian weekly
Reporter reported on Wednesday.
Although it was unclear whether the normalization was possible, Serri
stressed that he personally believed that Ethiopia and Eritrea should
normalize their bilateral relations strained during the 1998-2000
border war.
Speaking at Bari University in Italy recently, the EU envoy explained
that if the demarcation of borders began before the concerning parties
started to engage in a direct dialogue, there could be the risk of the
resumption of tension and conflict.
The two-year border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea claimed
thousands of lives from both sides.
