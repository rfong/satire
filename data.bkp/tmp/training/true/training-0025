Croatian/NNP Serbs/NNP say/VBP they/PRP will/MD fight/VB property/NN confiscation/NN A/DT top/JJ Croatian/NNP Serb/NNP lawmaker/NN said/VBD Monday/NNP that/IN his/PRP$ party/NN would/MD fight/VB three/CD new/JJ laws/NNS which/WDT Serbs/NNP believe/VBP could/MD mean/VB the/DT disappearance/NN of/IN Croatia/NNP 's/POS Serb/NNP minority/NN ./.

Veselin/NNP Pejnovic/NNP ,/, the/DT vice/NN president/NN of/IN the/DT tiny/JJ Serb/NNP Popular/NNP Party/NNP ,/, said/VBD his/PRP$ party/NN planned/VBD a/DT court/NN battle/NN against/IN laws/NNS that/WDT required/VBD Serbs/NNP who/WP fled/VBD fighting/VBG in/IN the/DT Krajina/NNP region/NN in/IN August/NNP to/TO return/VB by/IN late/JJ December/NNP or/CC lose/VB their/PRP$ homes/NNS and/CC farms/NNS ./.

The/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS estimated/VBD Monday/NNP that/IN more/JJR than/IN 180,000/CD people/NNS fled/VBD the/DT Krajina/NNP since/IN it/PRP was/VBD retaken/VBN by/IN the/DT Croatian/JJ army/NN in/IN early/JJ August/NNP ,/, and/CC has/VBZ said/VBN that/IN harassment/NN ,/, looting/NN and/CC burning/NN were/VBD reported/VBN into/IN this/DT past/JJ week/NN ./.

Pejnovic/NNP accused/VBD Serbia/NNP of/IN cooperating/VBG in/IN what/WP amounted/VBD to/TO massive/JJ property/NN theft/NN ,/, with/IN Serbs/NNP benefiting/VBG from/IN the/DT ``/`` ethnic/JJ cleansing/NN ''/'' of/IN northern/JJ Bosnia/NNP ./.

``/`` Zagreb/NNP and/CC Belgrade/NNP have/VBP formed/VBN a/DT partnership/NN to/TO split/VB the/DT land/NN between/IN them/PRP while/IN paying/VBG no/DT attention/NN to/TO the/DT people/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

If/IN the/DT court/NN challenge/NN fails/VBZ ,/, as/IN is/VBZ likely/JJ ,/, Pejnovic/NNP said/VBD his/PRP$ party/NN would/MD boycott/VB legislative/JJ elections/NNS set/VBN for/IN October/NNP 29/CD ,/, which/WDT he/PRP described/VBD as/IN a/DT ``/`` farce/NN ./. ''/''

The/DT lawmaker/NN ,/, whose/WP$ party/NN holds/VBZ three/CD of/IN 138/CD seats/NNS in/IN the/DT lower/JJR chamber/NN ,/, said/VBD that/IN they/PRP had/VBD also/RB approached/VBN the/DT World/NNP Court/NNP at/IN The/DT Hague/NNP and/CC asked/VBN for/IN the/DT laws/NNS to/TO be/VB condemned/VBN ./.

The/DT laws/NNS in/IN question/NN were/VBD officially/RB published/VBN Monday/NNP and/CC ,/, according/VBG to/TO Croatian/NNP law/NN ,/, will/MD go/VB into/IN effect/NN in/IN four/CD days/NNS ./.

Two/CD cover/VBP how/WRB Serbs/NNP can/MD avoid/VB confiscation/NN of/IN their/PRP$ property/NN by/IN claiming/VBG it/PRP in/IN person/NN and/CC with/IN deed/NN in/IN hand/NN ./.

The/DT original/JJ deadline/NN was/VBD extended/VBN to/TO December/NNP from/IN September/NNP ,/, which/WDT rights/NNS groups/NNS had/VBD said/VBN was/VBD virtually/RB impossible/JJ because/RB of/IN the/DT difficulties/NNS and/CC expense/NN of/IN getting/VBG a/DT passport/NN ./.

As/IN recently/RB as/RB Saturday/NNP ,/, John/NNP Shattuck/NNP ,/, the/DT US/NNP assistant/NN secretary/NN of/IN state/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD concerned/VBN about/IN the/DT Serbs/NNPS '/POS right/NN to/TO return/VB to/TO the/DT Krajina/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN largely/RB Serb/JJ for/IN hundreds/NNS of/IN years/NNS ./.

The/DT third/JJ law/NN establishes/VBZ a/DT census/NN for/IN 1996/CD and/CC would/MD create/VB a/DT status/NN ``/`` without/IN citizenship/NN ''/'' for/IN people/NNS who/WP have/VBP a/DT home/NN in/IN Croatia/NNP but/CC do/VBP not/RB live/VB here/RB ./.

Essentially/RB it/PRP means/VBZ that/IN thousands/NNS of/IN Croatian/NNP Serbs/NNPS would/MD lose/VB their/PRP$ citizenship/NN ./.

Pejnovic/NNP ,/, who/WP estimated/VBD that/IN between/IN 30/CD and/CC 40/CD percent/NN of/IN Croatian/NNP Serb/NNP wanted/VBD to/TO return/VB ,/, described/VBD the/DT new/JJ laws/NNS as/IN Zagreb/NNP 's/POS attempt/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN Serbs/NNP do/VBP not/RB return/VB --/: ``/`` ethnic/JJ cleansing/NN ./.
