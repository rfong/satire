Thomas could be first NBA minority owner
Former National Basketball Association star Isiah Thomas has made a deal to
buy the Toronto Raptors, becoming the first African-American with majority
ownership of a North American sports team.
Thomas, now general manager of the NBA club, signed a letter of intent
with current majority owner Allan Slaight. The deal is expected to be
completed in a few months, pending league approval.
Thomas would become the third owner in the history of the two-year-old
club. He owns nine percent of the team with a Canadian bank holding 10
percent and Slaight owning the rest.
Thomas led the Detroit Pistons to consecutive NBA crowns before Michael
Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their NBA domination in 1991.
