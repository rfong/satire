Former Russian Prosecutor-General Detained for Bribery 
Russia's former Acting Prosecutor-General, Alexei Ilyusenko, was
detained today on suspicion of taking a bribe and abusing his duties, a
high-ranking official here confirmed.
Alexander Zvyagintsev, assistant to the Prosecutor-General, told
reporters that the detention was carried out in accordance with Article
90 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
In his speech in his hometown of Yekaterinburg, some 1,440 kilometers
south-east of Moscow, earlier today, President Boris Yeltsin
specifically informed about initiating criminal proceedings against
several high-ranking officials, including Ilyushenko, Chairman of the
State Committee of Precious Metals Yevgeny Bychkov and Head of the Vo
gda regional administration Nikolai Podgornov.
Yeltsin has recently enforced his determination to fight against the
corruption in the structures of power as one of his steps in efforts to
run for his second term of office in June.
According to local reports, some 1,200 officials have been sacked or
punished so far in the ongoing anticorruption wave.
