"I also raised the specific timing problems involved in the auction of
foreign quotas of rice imports into Japan," Howard said. "The current
timing particularly disadvantages Australian rice producers and exporters."
Japanese auctions are now geared towards harvests in the northern
hemisphere and thus benefit producers such as the United States, the
main competitor to Australia is supplying rice to Japan, an Australian
embassy official said.
Under an agreement reached in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks
in late 1993, Japan agreed to a partial opening of it rice market.
During their talks, Howard said he thanked Hashimoto "for the way in
which Japan had strongly supported Australia's desire to be part of the
Asia-European meeting," which held its first 25-nation summit in
Bangkok in March.
"Japan has been very articulate and strong in support of Australia and
we continue to appreciate that very much," he said.
Despite their APEC membership, Australia and New Zealand were excluded
from the Bangkok summit and have pressed to attend the next one, in
Britain in 1998.
Hashimoto meanwhile accepted Howards's invitation to visit Australia
next year, a Japanese foreign ministry official said.
