Enraged elephants trample five to death: report 
More than 100 rampaging elephants trampled five people to death after
breaking through a vandalised game fence in southern Malawi, the
official Malawi News Agency reported Thursday.
The elephants escaped from Liwonde National Park on Monday and wandered
into a nearby village, the agency said.
"The animals were provoked when people started shouting and beating
drums to scare them," a villager was quoted as saying.
Game scouts backed by heavily-armed police drove the elephants back
into the park, one of Malawi's top tourist attractions, but not before
they had destroyed sugar cane and banana plantations.
