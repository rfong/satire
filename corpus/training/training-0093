Brief Introduction to ICA Congress
The 13th International Congress on Archives will be held in the
International Convention Center, Beijing, China, from September 2 to 7,
1996.
More than 2,600 delegates from 140 countries or areas are expected to
attend the congress, the last one in this century, whose theme reads
"Archives by the end of the century: taking stock and looking ahead".
The congress, the general assembly of the International Council on
Archives(ICA) headquartered in Paris, meets every 4 years.
Entrusted with the dual mission of retrospecting and prospecting, the
congress is fully conscious of its role of linking the past experience
with what is happening now.
The ICA was first decided upon at the 1948 professional archivists
meeting under the auspice of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization, and officially established in Paris, in
August, 1950.
Its prime aim is to encourage and support, in cooperation with other
international governmental or non-governmental organizations and
agencies, the development of archives preservation and management.
Beijing, a treasury of historic legacies, looks forward to this rare
opportunity of information exchange in archives keeping and using among
the international professionals.
