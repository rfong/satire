Tamil Tigers kill 20 civilians in major attack 
Tamil Tiger guerrillas killed at least 20 civilians and wounded several
others during a major attack in northeastern Sri Lanka Friday, defence
sources said.
Gunmen of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
launched an assault on the Kallarawa military camp in the Trincomalee
district and carried out a simultaneous raid on civilians in a nearby
village, the sources said.
"We have reports of 20 civilians getting killed. The Tigers seemed to
have set fire to a section of the army camp," the defence source said,
adding that the Tigers prevented the military from going to the aid of
civilians.
The region, just 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of the former British
base of Trincomalee, was the scene of an LTTE ambush on the army last
week. The Tigers killed 13 soldiers and three civilians during that
attack.
The latest LTTE attack came as the military clamped an indefinite night
curfew at seven villages in the LTTE-held northern Jaffna peninsula in
an apparent bid to ease the pressure on troops in the island's east.
The LTTE has escalated its attacks against security forces and
civilians in the eastern regions since withdrawing from a truce on
April 19 to resume their campaign for a separate state called Eelam for
minority Tamils.
