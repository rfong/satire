Southern Chinese Re-employment Project Making Some Headway 
A re-employment project in south China's Guangdong Province has had
some success, the deputy governor of the province, Zhong Qiquan, told a
provincial labor conference Thursday.
By the end of last year, 180,000 workers that had been laid off, or 67
percent of Guangdong's army of laid-off workers, had found new jobs.
The overall employment situation in Guangdong is stable, Zhong said,
and the 2.3 percent of urban workers reported as laid-off, are fewer
that the 3 percent nationally.
Priority will be given to coal, textile, and sugar industries this year
as an important means of relieving the burdens of unemployment in state
enterprises, Zhong said.
Last year, the prosperous province started establishing re-employment
foundations to help cash-starved enterprises and increase re-employment
methods. It also provides free training for unemployed workers to
improve working skills, and 300,000 workers have taken these courses,
accounting for 45 percent of the province's laid-off force, and over 70
percent of the trainees soon got new jobs.
Gan Zhaojiong, the director of the provincial labor department, said
that the province plans to continue the re-employment project this year
and see to it that over 70 percent of the laid-off workers find new
jobs this year.
