But Uruguay hardly needed it as they continued their first half domination
Fonseca nearly scored midway through the second period, but his
left-foot volley hit first time was smothered by keeper Diaz.
Minutes later coach Hector Nunez and home supporters had a scare as
Francescoli turned his ankle and was stretchered off the pitch.
While Francescoli was still having treatment, Sergio Martinez, a
leading scorer in the Argentinian league, came on as substitute for
Fonseca.
Paraguay took advantage of the shake-up in Uruguay's ranks to force
their best chance of the match. Carlos Gamarra's looping header hit the
crossbar with the keeper well beaten.
Francescoli returned for a few moments, but, with his ankle still
bothering him, was replaced by Marcelo Saralegui for a scrappy last 20
minutes.
Nunez had urged home fans to be patient in the early matches, but his
caution proved unnecessary as they now top group A with the maximum six
points from two games.
Uruguay beat Venezuela 4-1 in their opening match on Wednesday on their
way to a possible 11th Copa America title. Paraguay, who beat Mexico
2-1 in their first match, are also set to qualify.
Meanwhile, in the other match, Mexico went ahead in the 41st minute.
Luis Garcia hit a well-timed pass to Espinoza, who ran into the box
before Jesus Valbuena clipped his ankle for a clear spot kick.
And Garcia made no mistake as he slotted the ball to the right of
keeper Gilberto Andelucci.
