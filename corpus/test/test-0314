Myanmar, Chinese Company Sign Cement Plant Accord 
The Myanmar Ceramics Industry authorities and a Chinese company signed
an agreement here Friday on building a cement plant project in Kyaukse,
central Mandalay Division of the country.
The signing ceremony of the agreement between the state-run Myanmar
Ceramics Industry (MCI) of the Ministry of Industry-1 and the China
National Constructional and Agricultural Import and Export Corporation
(CAMC) was attended by Myanmar Minister of Industry-1 U Aung Thaung and
Economical and Commercial Counselor of the Chinese Embassy Jin Honggen.
Representing their respective parties, Managing Director of MCI U Than
Shwe and Chairman of the CAMC Ren Honbin signed the agreement.
The plant, whose capacity is to be 500 tons a day, will have machinery
and technology worth 16.5 million U.S. dollars. And it will be built
within 22 months.
Myanmar produced a total of 338,007 tons of cement in 1999, a drop of
7.38 percent compared with 1998.
In recent years, Myanmar has sped up the pace of infrastructural
construction of roads, bridges and dams, resulting in a shortage of
cement day by day.
To meet the rising demand for cement, the Myanmar government has been
trying to build more cement plants.
