Dutch Team Joins in Zambia Bombings Probe 
The Royal Netherlands Police have joined the Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI) of the United States in trying to find who was
behind a spate of bombings that had rocked Lusaka two weeks ago.
Dutch ambassador to Zambia, Nim De Beers, confirmed the arrival of a
team from his country to help with investigations that would establish
who was behind 14 bombs that had exploded in Lusaka, leaving vital
infrastructure destroyed.
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper on Monday quoted De Beer as saying that the
team has already arrived in the country and is working with the U.S.
investigation group in its operation.
He said the team's work is progressing well and hopefully it would soon
conclude its work.
The ambassador said the Dutch team will give its findings to the
Zambian government so that the government could be in a better position
to know what to do with the bombing incident which took place in late
February.
De Beers said the Dutch team had come into Zambia at the request of the
Zambian government, which is seeking to have an independent
investigation in the matter.
