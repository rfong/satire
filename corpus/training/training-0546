US Business Inventories Up 0.4% in August 
U.S. business inventories rose 0.4 percent in August, the 17th straight
increase since March 1994, the Commerce Department reported today.
The gain follows a 0.5 percent rise in July and a 0.4 percent increase
in June. The July figure was revised upward from an earlier 0.3 percent
estimate.
The report said business inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted
969.1 billion dollars in August, up from 964.9 billion dollars in July.
Analysts said that stocks are accumulating at a moderate pace after
businesses trimmed excess inventories earlier this year as the economy
slowed to a crawl.
The report also said that business sales surged 1.5 percent in August,
the biggest jump in a year.
Business sales in August were at a seasonally adjusted 686.1 billion
dollars, up from 675.8 billion dollars the previous month, the report
added.
The inventory-to-sales ratio in August fell to 1.41, from 1.43 in July.
The latest figure means it would take 1.41 months to exhaust stockpiles
at the August sales rate.
