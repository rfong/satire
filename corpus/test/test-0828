Annan Welcomes Pakistan's Intention of Signing 
The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Wednesday welcomed Pakistan's
intention of signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty(CTBT).
In his speech to the 53rd Session of the General Assembly, Mohammad
Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's Prime Minister, announced that his country was
prepared to adhere to the CTBT before the Conference of States Parties
to the Treaty scheduled to be held in September 1999. But he set the
condition that Pakistan's adherence to the Treaty would take place only
when it was free from coercion or pressure.
"I have consistently urged India and Pakistan to sign the Treaty and
join the negotiations to ban the production of missile material for
nuclear weapons and halt the deployment of nuclear weapons. The
Government of Pakistan is to be commended for heeding the concern of
the international community," Annan said in a statement.
"The announcement is particularly gratifying since tomorrow is the
second anniversary of the opening for signature of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty at United Nations Headquarters in New York, an
important milestone in the history of efforts to end the nuclear arms
race and to achieve nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament," the
U.N. chief said.
Annan said the Treaty had been signed by 150 states and ratified by 21,
including two nuclear-weapon states, and 44 states with nuclear power
were needed to ratify the Treaty in order for it to enter into force.
"With Pakistan's signature, 42 of those states will have signed. India
and Democratic People's Republic of Korea have not. Of those 42 states,
10 have ratified the Treaty, " the U.N. Secretary-General added.
