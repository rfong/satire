Some see ray of hope after Wall Street survives another blow 
More corporate scandals stung Wall Street over the past week, but some
analysts say the market's response may show that the worst may be over
after a horrendous first half of 2002.
After a volatile week, the Dow Jones industrials ended with a small
loss of 0.11 percent for the week to Friday at 9,243.26 while the
Standard and Poor's 500 managed to eke out a 0.07 percent gain to
989.82.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite meanwhile rose 1.66 percent to
1,464.91.
Closing out the first half of 2002, the Dow is down 7.8 percent, the S
and P 500 down 13.8 percent, and the Nasdaq down 25 percent -- the
worst first-half performance in its history.
But the modest snapback after five straight losing weeks on Wall Street
gave some hope to market watchers, although the outlook was less than
clear.
Stocks were roiled by the startling disclosure of 3.8 billion dollars
in improperly booked expenses at WorldCom, sparking fears of a massive
corporate failure and threatening to further undermine investor
confidence in the wake of the Enron affair.
The markets shrugged off a set of largely positive economic data,
including a revision that showed the US economy grew at a sizzling 6.1
percent pace in the first quarter.
But some analysts were heartened that the markets steady after the
WorldCom bombshell and paid little heed to news of accounting
irregularities disclosed at Xerox.
Some say the markets may have or will soon establish a "double bottom"
after hitting at or near the lows of September 21, in the wake of the
September 11 attacks.
"The latest shocking revelation of corporate mischief provided an
unwelcome test of investor sentiment this week" said Robert DiClemente
of Salomon Smith Barney.
"But with the equity market off five previous weeks running and nearly
15 percent since late March, there have been signs -- tentative at
least -- that the worst kind of panic may yet be avoided ... market
pessimism might have reached an extreme earlier this week."
"Once confidence stabilizes, a double bottom in the stock market is
likely," said Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo.
"During the first half of 2002, the stock market suffered from a double
whammy of lousy confidence and poor profits. During the second half,
the confidence may not improve dramatically, but the double-digit gains
in profits should spread some sunshine on the otherwise gloomy
landscape in equities."
Analyst Kevin Caron at Ryan Beck said stocks are now beaten down so far
that investors may start coming back.
"I think we're at levels, particularly in the wake of the WorldCom
disclosure, that are extremely attractive relatively to other asset
classes," he said.
"Investors are starting to move cash off the sidelines into stocks as
long as we see improvement in earnings and decent signs in the economy,
valuation gaps will close and investors will continue to move into
equities."
Among active issues, Qwest was caught in the telecom downdraft, losing
39 percent to 2.80.
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia slumped 28.18 percent 11.47 amid
reports of a widening probe into a questionable stock trade by founder
Martha Stewart.
US Airways fell 4.64 percent to 3.70 after deferring some payments and
warning of bankruptcy.
General Electric rose 0.35 percent to 29.05 after reaffirming earnings
targets.
Micron Technology gained 7.6 percent to 20.22 on positive analyst
comments.
The bond market weakened slightly, as the yield on the 10-year Treasury
bond rose to 4.800 percent from 4.760 percent a week earlier and on the
30-year bond to 5.510 percent after 5.395 percent.
Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
