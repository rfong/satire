Decision in the Super League court appeal to be handed down Friday 
News Corp. chief Rupert Murdoch will arrive in Australia on Friday in
time to hear Federal Court appeal bench's judgement in the dispute over
his proposed Rugby Super League.
Murdoch is coming to Australia for News Ltd's annual meeting in
Adelaide on Monday, but is expected to be with his Australian
executives as they deal with the appeal at the end of the long-running
battle for control of Australian rugby league.
News and Super League chiefs are not expected to be in court for the
decision, a process which is likely to take no more than two or three
minutes, but Ken Arthurson and John Quayle, bosses of the establishment
Australian Rugby League (ARL), are expected to attend.
The original Super League court case earlier this year ran for 51 days
before Justice James Burchett.
There were five or six more days of legal manoeuvring over the orders
he made banning the rebel competition until the end of the century, and
then the appeal hearing lasted another nine days.
Most of the 260 players and coaches who signed up with News Ltd's
breakaway competition played the recently-completed 1996 season in the
ARL competition while being paid by News Ltd.
Many have ARL-registered contracts which are due to expire at the end
of this month and are contracted to Super League for the next few
seasons.
If the appeal judges were to also overturn Burchett's ban on Super
League, these players would form the basis of what could be a second
Australian rugby league competition in opposition to the ARL.
Many rugby league people see a two-competition outcome as being the
worst possible scenario. Others believe some form of compromise between
News Ltd and the ARL could emerge if there is no clear winner in court.
The key to any deal, though, remains pay-TV rights, which were behind
News Ltd's decision to stage the Super League raid on clubs, coaches
and players early last year.
