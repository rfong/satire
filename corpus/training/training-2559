Private Firms in East China To Take on China's West 
Private enterprises in the eastern areas of China are making
preparations to participate in the country's strategy of developing the
less developed western region.
A special fair was held here today to brief private firms in the east
on projects in the west.
An official with the State Economic and Trade Commission said that the
fair aims to provide investment opportunities for private enterprises
in the east.
A similar fair will be held in Xining, capital city of Qinghai Province
in Northwest China.
Over 100 private enterprises from Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui,
Guangdong and other provinces attended today's fair. Many enterprises
brought along projects and technological patents to seek cooperative
opportunities with western regions.
Six delegations from western provinces and autonomous regions showcased
more than 2,000 projects at the fair.
