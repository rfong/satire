The/DT United/NNP States/NNPS has/VBZ appealed/VBN for/IN the/DT release/NN of/IN David/NNP Daliberti/NNP ,/, 41/CD ,/, of/IN Jacksonville/NNP ,/, Florida/NNP ,/, and/CC William/NNP Barloon/NNP ,/, 39/CD ,/, of/IN New/NNP Hampton/NNP ,/, Iowa/NNP ,/, since/IN their/PRP$ arrest/NN March/NNP 13/CD ./.

The/DT men/NNS were/VBD convicted/VBN by/IN a/DT Baghdad/NNP court/NN on/IN March/NNP 25/CD ./.

U.S./NNP officials/NNS say/VBP the/DT pair/NN crossed/VBD the/DT southern/JJ border/NN with/IN Kuwait/NNP by/IN accident/NN on/IN their/PRP$ way/NN to/TO visit/VB friends/NNS at/IN a/DT U.N./NNP border/NN post/NN ./.

A/DT senior/JJ Iraqi/JJ official/NN ,/, Hassab/NNP al-Oubaidi/NNP of/IN the/DT foreign/JJ relations/NNS department/NN of/IN the/DT Baghdad/NNP parliament/NN ,/, suggested/VBD Saturday/NNP that/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT Americans/NNPS could/MD be/VB settled/VBN ``/`` in/IN the/DT coming/VBG few/JJ days/NNS ./.

But/CC he/PRP did/VBD not/RB elaborate/VB ./.

The/DT legal/JJ experts/NNS said/VBD Daliberti/NNP and/CC Barloon/NNP must/MD present/VB all/DT relevant/JJ papers/NNS and/CC documents/NNS to/TO the/DT Appeals/NNP Court/NNP when/WRB they/PRP ask/VBP for/IN a/DT review/NN of/IN their/PRP$ sentences/NNS ./.

U.S./NNP officials/NNS have/VBP been/VBN working/VBG to/TO secure/VB the/DT men/NNS 's/POS release/NN through/IN the/DT Polish/NNP Embassy/NNP ,/, which/WDT handles/VBZ American/JJ interests/NNS in/IN Baghdad/NNP in/IN the/DT absence/NN of/IN direct/JJ U.S.-Iraqi/JJ diplomatic/JJ relations/NNS ./.

Iraqi/JJ officials/NNS ,/, like/IN al-Oubaidi/NNP ,/, have/VBP made/VBN vaguely/RB hopeful/CD remarks/NNS ,/, while/IN others/NNS and/CC government-run/JJ newspapers/NNS have/VBP taken/VBN tougher/JJR lines/NNS that/WDT have/VBP made/VBN it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO discern/VB what/WP the/DT official/JJ line/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT jailed/JJ Americans/NNPS ./.

For/IN instance/NN ,/, al-Qadissiyah/NN ,/, the/DT Defense/NNP Ministry/NNP 's/POS daily/NN ,/, said/VBD Sunday/NNP that/IN they/PRP are/VBP no/RB different/JJ from/IN Mexicans/NNPS trying/VBG to/TO immigrate/VB illegally/RB to/TO the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Iraq/NNP 's/POS foreign/JJ minister/NN ,/, Mohammed/NNP Saeed/NNP al-Sahhaf/NNP ,/, noted/VBD Thursday/NNP that/IN he/PRP did/VBD not/RB believe/VB that/IN two/CD Americans/NNS entered/VBD Iraq/NNP accidentally/RB ,/, but/CC must/MD have/VB had/VBN a/DT darker/JJR motive/NN ./.

He/PRP and/CC other/JJ senior/JJ officials/NNS have/VBP repeatedly/RB said/VBD they/PRP suspect/VBP the/DT Americans/NNPS '/POS entry/NN into/IN Iraq/NNP was/VBD linked/VBN to/TO U.S./NNP efforts/NNS to/TO blunt/VB Baghdad/NNP 's/POS drive/NN to/TO have/VB U.N./NNP trade/NN sanctions/NNS lifted/VBN ./.

The/DT embargo/NN ,/, imposed/VBN after/IN Iraq/NNP invaded/NNP Kuwait/NNP in/IN August/NNP 1990/CD ,/, has/VBZ devastated/VBN Iraq/NNP 's/POS economy/NN and/CC caused/VBN worsening/VBG hardship/NN for/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS 18/CD million/CD people/NNS ./.
