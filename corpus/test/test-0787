Oil-rich Venezuela expressed hope that its Mercosur negotiations would be
completed by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, Colombia has expressed interest in talks with Mercosur as
part of an Andean bloc that would include Ecuador and Peru in addition
to Bolivia and Venezuela.
A Colombian official said Andean negotiations could begin as soon as
January, even hough Bolivia and Venezuela have a head start and the
commercial interests of each country differ.
And Mexico, a member of the the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) with the United States and Canada, is exploring closer ties to
Mercosur in an effort to revive flagging trade with the region
following its economic implosion and currency devaluation.
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is said to be considering a trip to
Argentina next month to discuss Mercosur membership.
Two years ago, 34 countries from Canada to Chile including the United
States agreed to negotiate by 2005 a "Free Trade Area of the Americas."
