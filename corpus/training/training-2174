Yong'an Insurance Company Opens in Xi'an
Western China's first transregional insurance company, Yong'an
Insurance Stock Company, recently opened in Xi'an, the capital of
Shaanxi Province.
The company's major share-holders are several large state-owned
industrial enterprises. It has a registered capital of 680 million
yuan.
President of the Board Wang Jiancai said the company plans to open
branches in five northwestern provinces and autonomous regions:
Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai and Xinjiang, as well as in Sichuan
Province in the southwest and Shanxi Province in the north.
The establishment of Yong'an is regarded by some local observers as a
result of China's current financial reform, which will have a profound
effect on economic development in the northwestern part of China.
