Britain's VIP escorts to be armed 
Police officers charged with escorting VIPs and guarding Britain's
royal palaces are to be armed, a Scotland Yard spokesman said Monday.
The special escort group, also charged with accompanying dangerous
prisoners, are the third category of police officers to be allowed
permanent licence to carry arms in the capital.
Other groups to be allowed to carry arms are the 50 officers of the
special emergency group and the officers protecting Downing Street and
diplomatic residences.
Scotland Yard did not say how many police officers would now be allowed
to carry arms in Britain but said ordinary police officers would still
be unarmed.
Both police authorities and the general public are reluctant to allow
police constables to carry arms, fearing it could spark an increase in
criminal violence.
