NATO Starts Fifth Night of Airstrikes Against 
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began its fifth night of
airstrikes against Yugoslavia Sunday, the U.S. Defense Department said.
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon announced that more American warplanes,
including long-range bombers, would be added to the nearly 200 already
participating in Operation Allied Force.
Bacon said between six and 12 planes would be added, although Defense
Secretary William Cohen had not signed the formal order Sunday.
At the White House, Clinton met with his top national security aides
and said he had talked with leaders of several NATO allies, including
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac.
"All of them share our determination to respond strongly to Slobodan
Milosevic's continuing campaign of inhumane violence against the
Kosovar Albanian people," Clinton told reporters. "That is what we
intend to do." Clinton said he strongly supported NATO's decision to
step up its air campaign in Kosovo.
Without specifically mentioning Saturday's loss of an F-117A, Clinton
said he had warned from the start of "real risks" in NATO's
confrontation in the sky over Yugoslavia. "But the continued brutality
and repression of the Serb forces further underscores the need for NATO
to persevere," he claimed.
The NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia were launched last week after
Serbs refused to enter into a peace agreement with the majority ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, the largest Serb province. nnnn 05:42 05:42 g #
