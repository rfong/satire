Underground Commercial Center Under Construction in Nanjing 
A huge underground shopping center is being built in Nanjing, capital
of Jiangsu Province.
Covering a total of 22,000 square meters, the commercial complex will
have an 18-meter-wide, 306-meter-long shopping street, plus a
two-storey basement.
Located below one of the city's busiest streets, Xinjiekou Street, the
underground property will have 15 entrances, seven of them linked to
department stores, financial institutions and entertainment facilities
at street-level.
The construction, estimated to cost over 100 million yuan (12 million
US dollars), is expected to be completed in 1998.
