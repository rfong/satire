Russian Financial Crisis is Over, Says Kiriyenko 
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has said that the most
dangerous moment of Russia's financial crisis has gone, the Interfax
news agency reported Monday.
In an interview with the NTV television on Sunday evening, Kiriyenko
said the anti-crisis program he announced last Friday was working.
The premier said the main cause of the crisis was a sharp fall in the
world market prices for oil and gas, Russia's principal export items,
which led to "the worsening of the financial position of leading
companies -- the main taxpayers."
Another cause was the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and its
inevitable reverberations in Russia, which "in light of huge debts, is
very dependent on the world financial system today," he said.
Strikes, social unrest and political conflicts between executive and
legislative bodies in the country all contributed in the eruption of
the financial crisis, he said.
Kiriyenko said it is almost useless to toughen tax collection or even
introduce more taxes to raise the budget revenues. The budget revenues
will increase with the production growth, he added.
He said the government has no plan to raise the tax burden of
enterprises in normal operation. However, tough measures will be
introduced for those in debt, he said.
It is necessary for the government to increase income and cut spending
to overcome the current difficulty, Kiriyenko said.
Russian ex-premier and economist Yegro Gaidar, in a separate interview
with the television on Sunday, said because of the correct moves by the
Central Bank and the government the financial situation has started to
improve.
He said, "The lesson was very useful and the government program was
aimed at solving the grave structural problem with a better budget
policy."
