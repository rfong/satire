Benazzi slams Kiwi aggression 
French star Abdelatif Benazzi fired a broadside at New Zealand rugby on
Sunday, accusing their forward line of playing too rough.
Benazzi, a stalwart of the tourists' back row, was still angry after
their hard-fought 33-25 victory over a New Zealand XV at Wanganui on
Saturday.
"Their aggression is unhealthy," he fumed. "On Saturday, you could say
that when Philippe Benetton was head butted it was accidental.
"But when Laurent Benezech got a set of studs in the head, that was
intentional."
Benazzi said: "You could see that the New Zealanders were aiming for
the vital areas -- the head and neck."
He added: "And it's just as well for me that I wear a box!"
As for Kiwi bad boy Richard Loe, who picked up a near one-year ban in
1992, Benazzi said "I hope he'll learn from it, as I did with my
suspension, four years ago in Australia."
Benazzi had walked on an opponent during France's opening Test match.
