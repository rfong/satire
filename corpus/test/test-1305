Car Theft on the Rise in Czech Republic 
More than 25,000 cars worth a total of 3.7 billion korun (137 million
U.S. dollars) were stolen in the country last year.
But despite mounting police efforts to curb theft, less than 1,000 cars
were recovered.
Some 40 per cent of the cars stolen were Czech-made Skoda sedans.
Quality imported cars such as Volkswagen, Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz
were also targets -- some 1,780 Volkswagen sedans were stolen last
year.
