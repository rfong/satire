China threatens foreign ad agencies with closure 
China has issued a stern warning to foreign-funded advertising firms to
obey strict new guidelines regulating their conduct or face closure, a
report said Wednesday.
The warning, issued by the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce (SAIC), is the latest move by the authorities to clamp down on
the advertising industry, which has witnessed remarkable growth in
recent years but is riddled with corruption.
The new guidelines, jointly drafted by the SAIC and the foreign
ministry, came into effect this week and are the first to regulate
foreign-funded agencies in China.
According to the China Daily, the rules are aimed at binding companies
to agreements they signed when starting up operations in China,
including commitments to introducing advanced foreign techniques and
equipment.
"It has been found out that some of the joint ventures or cooperation
advertising firms had conducted businesses without reaching the
conditions and qualities required by the state," said Liu Baofu, an
SAIC official responsible for managing the advertising sector.
"Some have even disrupted the normal order of the domestic advertising
business by conducting illegal businesses and unfair competition," the
newspaper quoted Liu as saying.
Competition is intense in an industry that has more than tripled in
size over the last few years, especially among agencies scrambling for
increasingly limited advertising space on television and in the press.
The new rules set minimum qualifications a foreign investor must meet
to participate in the domestic advertising market. Exisiting firm will
be checked, and those failing to make the grade will be closed.
China approved the establishment of its first foreign-funded
advertising firm in 1986, since when more than 180 agencies have been
set up as joint ventures or cooperatives.
