Frenchman tires of Thai girlfriend, begs her deportation 
Tired of the Thai girlfriend whom he had invited to live with him, a
Frenchman asked authorities Friday to deport her back to her homeland.
The man, 30, had brought the 23-year-old woman back to France in May
last year. Her tourist visa ran out in October but he continued to look
after her, according to what he told police.
But sexual problems loomed and, when she refused to have sex with
another man in front of him, the end was nigh.
He took her to a police station in this city in western France and
asked that she be deported.
Prosecutors in Nantes eventually persuaded him to buy her ticket home
and she is awaiting deportation. He could face prosecution for lodging
an illegal immigrant.
