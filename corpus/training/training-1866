62 Processing Zone Projects Approved in Zimbabwe 
Zimbabwe's Export Processing Zone Authority has approved 62 projects
worth about 80 million U.S. Dollars over the past year, Sunday Mail
reported today.
Out of the 62 projects approved, 22 are already operational and created
over 5,000 jobs, the report said.
Although the remaining 40 projects were awaiting clearance from
concerned government departments, it is estimated that a further 6,000
jobs will be created once they are approved later this year.
The authority's Chairman Elias Ngugama and General Manager Walter
Chidhakwa Made the statements in a joint interviews with the paper.
They said a lot could have been achieved if all systems were responding
quickly to the investment drive initiative.
Ngugama said that the time that it is taking for programs to be
implemented is so long that sometimes business is being lost because
some investors felt that they were better off investing in other
countries which had the same program than waste time waiting.
''A lot must be done by all other players to ensure that business is
not unnecessarily lost. Although our investment incentive is very
attractive everyone must be aware of the fact that there are other
players entering the market in the region who have perhaps better
packages,'' said Ngugama.
He said that Zimbabwe had one of the best infrastructure and human
resource bases in the region which is a good motivation for investors.
However, the slow rate of making decisions tended to dampen the whole
initiative, he added.
