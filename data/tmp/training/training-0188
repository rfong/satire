France/NNP braces/VBZ for/IN snap/JJ elections/NNS France/NNP was/VBD bracing/VBG for/IN an/DT expected/JJ announcement/NN by/IN President/NNP Jacques/NNP Chirac/NNP on/IN Monday/NNP of/IN snap/JJ legislative/JJ elections/NNS ,/, in/IN what/WP could/MD be/VB a/DT huge/JJ political/JJ gamble/NN for/IN the/DT Gaullist/NNP leader/NN ./.

France/NNP 's/POS two/CD main/JJ televion/JJ channels/NNS said/VBD in/IN their/PRP$ Sunday/NNP evening/NN bulletins/NNS that/IN Chirac/NNP would/MD appear/VB on/IN television/NN the/DT following/JJ evening/NN to/TO announce/VB the/DT dissolution/NN of/IN parliament/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT stations/NNS --/: who/WP would/MD be/VB charged/VBN with/IN organising/VBG the/DT presidential/JJ address/NN and/CC who/WP can/MD therefore/RB be/VB considered/VBN well-informed/JJ --/: there/EX was/VBD no/RB longer/RB any/DT room/NN for/IN doubt/NN concerning/VBG Chirac/NNP 's/POS intentions/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT Elysee/NNP would/MD neither/RB confirm/VB nor/CC deny/VB the/DT information/NN ./.

Chirac/NNP ,/, who/WP took/VBD the/DT weekend/NN to/TO weigh/VB his/PRP$ decision/NN ,/, met/VBD with/IN his/PRP$ closest/JJS advisers/NNS Sunday/NNP evening/NN ,/, sources/NNS in/IN his/PRP$ entourage/NN said/VBD ./.

Leader/NNP of/IN the/DT opposition/NN Socialist/NNP Party/NNP Lionel/NNP Jospin/NNP said/VBD that/IN if/IN Chirac/NNP does/VBZ call/VB early/JJ elections/NNS it/PRP would/MD be/VB an/DT ``/`` admission/NN of/IN failure/NN ''/'' of/IN his/PRP$ government/NN ./.

Jospin/NNP suggested/VBD the/DT move/NN might/MD be/VB motivated/VBN by/IN the/DT wish/NN to/TO go/VB to/TO the/DT country/NN before/IN potentially-damaging/JJ cases/NNS of/IN alleged/VBN corruption/NN hanging/VBG over/RP several/JJ leading/VBG figures/NNS from/IN the/DT ruling/NN coalition/NN can/MD be/VB brought/VBN to/TO court/NN ./.

Speculation/NN that/IN the/DT elections/NNS would/MD be/VB brought/VBN forward/RP from/IN their/PRP$ original/JJ date/NN of/IN March/NNP next/JJ year/NN has/VBZ had/VBN Paris/NNP political/JJ circles/NNS in/IN a/DT frenzy/NN for/IN the/DT past/JJ two/CD weeks/NNS ./.

The/DT two-round/JJ elections/NNS ,/, which/WDT must/MD happen/VB between/IN 20-40/CD days/NNS after/IN the/DT formal/JJ dissolution/NN decree/NN is/VBZ signed/VBN ,/, are/VBP thought/VBN most/RBS likely/JJ to/TO be/VB scheduled/VBN for/IN June/NNP 1/CD and/CC 8/CD ./.

Premier/NNP Alain/NNP Juppe/NNP said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD ``/`` ready/JJ ''/'' for/IN ballots/NNS whenever/WRB they/PRP come/VBP ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT Journal/NNP du/NNP Dimanche/NNP weekly/JJ newspaper/NN ./.

``/`` A/DT politician/NN must/MD always/RB be/VB ready/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP was/VBD quoted/VBN by/IN the/DT paper/NN as/IN saying/VBG ./.

French/JJ markets/NNS dropped/VBD sharply/RB at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN last/JJ week/NN ,/, and/CC more/JJR turmoil/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN if/IN Chirac/NNP confirms/VBZ the/DT decision/NN Monday/NNP night/NN ./.

The/DT main/JJ reason/NN for/IN an/DT early/JJ dissolution/NN is/VBZ widely/RB agreed/VBN to/TO be/VB Europe/NNP union/NN ./.

If/IN elections/NNS were/VBD held/VBN early/RB next/JJ year/NN ,/, they/PRP would/MD come/VB barely/RB a/DT month/NN before/IN the/DT final/JJ deadline/NN on/IN countries/NNS to/TO enter/VB the/DT first/JJ wave/NN of/IN the/DT planned/JJ European/JJ single/JJ currency/NN ,/, the/DT euro/NN ./.

Government/NNP officials/NNS fear/VBP the/DT elections/NNS then/RB would/MD become/VB a/DT referendum/NN on/IN the/DT euro/NN ,/, an/DT issue/NN on/IN which/WDT the/DT French/NNP remain/VBP divided/VBN despite/IN the/DT apparent/JJ consensus/NN among/IN political/JJ leaders/NNS ./.

Chirac/NNP ,/, who/WP has/VBZ plumbed/VBN depths/NNS of/IN unpopularity/NN since/IN taking/VBG power/NN in/IN May/NNP 1995/CD ,/, is/VBZ also/RB seen/VBN keen/JJ to/TO ``/`` relaunch/VB ''/'' his/PRP$ ailing/JJ government/NN ,/, in/IN theory/NN to/TO give/VB him/PRP parliamentary/JJ support/NN through/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN his/PRP$ seven-year/JJ mandate/NN in/IN 2002/CD ./.

Analysts/NNS point/VBP out/RP that/IN the/DT ruling/VBG centre-right/JJ coalition/NN ,/, which/WDT routed/VBN the/DT left/NN in/IN 1993/CD elections/NNS ,/, can/MD not/RB hope/VB to/TO retain/VB its/PRP$ 80/CD percent/NN majority/NN in/IN the/DT 577-seat/JJ National/NNP Assembly/NNP ,/, but/CC may/MD consider/VB it/PRP will/MD lose/VB fewer/JJR seats/NNS now/RB than/IN later/RB ./.

But/CC the/DT gamble/NN involved/VBN in/IN snap/JJ ballots/NNS was/VBD underlined/VBN Sunday/NNP by/IN a/DT new/JJ poll/NN suggesting/VBG that/IN French/JJ voters/NNS may/MD be/VB ready/JJ to/TO express/VB their/PRP$ frustrations/NNS at/IN Juppe/NNP 's/POS and/CC Chirac/NNP 's/POS austerity/NN policies/NNS in/IN the/DT ballot/NN box/NN ./.

The/DT survey/NN by/IN the/DT IFOP/NNP polling/NN institute/NN showed/VBD support/NN for/IN both/DT Chirac/NNP and/CC Juppe/NNP dropping/VBG again/RB to/TO 31/CD and/CC 27/CD percent/NN respectively/RB ,/, echoing/VBG recent/JJ polls/NNS suggesting/VBG that/IN a/DT socialist-communist/JJ alliance/NN could/MD even/RB seize/VB a/DT majority/NN ./.

In/IN that/DT case/NN Chirac/NN ,/, far/RB from/IN relaunching/VBG his/PRP$ government/NN for/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS ,/, would/MD be/VB forced/VBN into/IN ``/`` cohabitation/NN ''/'' with/IN a/DT leftwing/VBG prime/JJ minister/NN ,/, most/RBS likely/JJ to/TO be/VB Jospin/NNP ./.

Jospin/NN ,/, who/WP put/VBD up/RP a/DT strong/JJ fight/NN against/IN Chirac/NNP in/IN the/DT 1995/CD presidential/JJ polls/NNS ,/, said/VBD in/IN a/DT TV/NN interview/NN Sunday/NNP night/NN that/IN the/DT left/NN could/MD unite/VB to/TO win/VB ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP can/MD come/VB together/RB around/IN this/DT campaign/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, referring/VBG to/TO his/PRP$ party/NN and/CC communists/NNS putting/VBG aside/RP their/PRP$ differences/NNS ,/, notably/RB over/IN Europe/NNP ,/, to/TO fight/VB the/DT ruling/VBG centre-right/JJ bloc/NN ./.

He/PRP dismissed/VBD the/DT argument/NN that/IN early/JJ elections/NNS were/VBD needed/VBN to/TO avoid/VB a/DT clash/NN of/IN interests/NNS next/JJ year/NN with/IN the/DT timetable/NN for/IN European/JJ monetary/JJ union/NN ,/, saying/VBG the/DT motives/NNS were/VBD more/RBR cynical/JJ ./.

``/`` The/DT economic/JJ situation/NN is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO get/VB worse/JJR ,/, with/IN unemployment/NN and/CC deficits/NNS ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP trying/VBG to/TO make/VB the/DT French/JJ vote/NN before/IN the/DT situation/NN gets/VBZ worse/JJR ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.
