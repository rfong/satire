The Nobel Committee's five members 
The Nobel Committee, which awarded the Nobel peace prize jointly to PLO
leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres, consists of five people, one of whom resigned in
protest of Arafat's portion of the prize.
Committe member Kaare Kristiansen, who calls himself a close friend of
Israel, resigned Friday saying that Arafat was not worthy of the award,
which was announced earlier Friday.
Kristiansen, 74, was a member of parliament for the Christian People's
Party and a former Norwegian oil minister.
The Comittee leader is 58-year-old Francis Sejersted, a professor in
economics and social history since 1973.
Committe member Hanna Kvanmo, 68, is a member of parliament for the
Socialist Left Party.
Member Odvar Nordli, 69, was Norway's prime minister from 1976 to 1981,
and served as a member of parliament for the Labour Party. He also
served as chief administrative officer for the Hedmark region, north of
Oslo.
Sissel Roenbeck, the youngest member of the comittee at 44, was
formerly a Labour Party member of parliament. She also served as a
government minister from 1979 to 1981.
The leader of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, is the committee's
secretary.
Swedish dynamite tycoon Alfred Nobel mandated in his 1895 will that
Norway award the peace prize each year.
"The prize should go to the person or persons who have contributed most
or best for the brotherhood of the people and the abolition or
reduction of armies, and establishing peace congresses," Nobel wrote.
The committe members are chosen by the Norwegian parliament, and serve
a six-year term.
