The Palestinians, for their part, had high hopes that the peace process and
reconstruction would alleviate their long-standing economic hardship.
But Israel's continuing blockade of the the Palestinian territories
after a deadly string of Islamic suicide bombings in the Jewish state
in February and March has worsened their living standards.
Shikaki said the Israelis had a emotional reaction to the suicide
bombings, electing a rightwing government in May by the slimmest of
margins that promised peace with security.
But hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delayed
Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian town of Hebron, expanded
Jewish settlements and ignited Palestinian frustrations last month when
he opened a tunnel in Jerusalem next to Moslem holy sites.
"I think the Palestinians had their own emotional reaction," said
Shikaki, referring to the four days of deadly clashes with Israeli
forces.
"But I don't think this represented a rejection of the peace process
but instead there was frustration that things had gotten off course,"
he said. "If there was such strong opposition to the peace process, the
violence would still be going on."
Elazer said that while the large majority of Israelis want peace, many
want the process slowed down to see how the new Palestinian entity
behaves.
"The process was good, but the speed too fast, many Israelis thought,"
he said. "There wasn't enough time to develop trust."
Shikaki, however, said the Palestinians have perhaps more riding on the
peace process and cannot afford to "wait and see."
"The peace process is the future for the Palestinians, but things could
go terribly wrong if there is not steady progress," he added.
