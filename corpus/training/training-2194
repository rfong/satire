Fugitive child molestor appointed Solomons' Attorney General
A fugitive child molesting lawyer wanted in Australia on an array of
serious charges has been sworn in as the Solomon Islands' new Attorney
General.
Australian Julian Moti, who escaped indictment in October 2006 while in
custody in Papua New Guinea, has been described as a close pal of
Solomons' Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.
The move has provoked fury in Australia where Prime Monster John Howard
said yesterday: "F*!*ing H!**! This is f***ing unbelievable! They've
been made to look like f***ing a****oles by this."
But the Solomons' PM Sogavare has repeatedly blocked Australia's
efforts to extradite Moti and has said the 1997 Vanuatu charges on
which he is wanted are trumped up and "despicable".
Today there was plenty of pomp and ceremony in Honiara where Governor
General Nathaniel Waena swore-in Moti in as Attorney General.
Moti later told the press: "I have modelled myself throughout my life
on the US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
"I see no reason to give up now."
