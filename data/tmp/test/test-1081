Actually/RB ,/, he/PRP hardly/RB likes/VBZ to/TO think/VB that/DT way/NN ./.

It/PRP does/VBZ mean/VB ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN Harris/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO give/VB opponents/NNS as/IN many/JJ different/JJ looks/NNS as/RB possible/JJ ./.

``/`` For/IN the/DT most/JJS part/NN ,/, ''/'' Harris/NNP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` players/NNS never/RB get/VBP to/TO play/VB enough/JJ minutes/NNS ,/, so/IN you/PRP always/RB have/VBP that/DT as/IN a/DT problem/NN ./.
