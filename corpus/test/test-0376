Pigeons Force Passenger Plane to Land
The plane, with 129 passengers aboard, took off from northwest China's
Xianyang Xi'an International Airport at 1:15 p.m., about half an hour
before the alarm was sounded, the Shanghai-based Wen Hui Bao daily
reported today.
Believing the fire was in the luggage compartment, the pilot requested
an emergency landing and rescue stand-by.
Technicians later found it was a false alarm, and concluded that it was
triggered by the bumping and fluttering pigeons inside the luggage
compartment.
The plane was a Xiamen Airlines flight bound for the central China city
of Wuhan.
