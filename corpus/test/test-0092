Report: Hundreds in Syria Face Unfair Trials, Often After Torture
Syria has tried hundreds of political activists since 1992, including
some who were tortured or detained for a decade without charge, a human
rights group said Saturday.
The repression was reported despite signs since the 1991 Gulf War that
Syria, ruled with an iron fist by President Hafez Assad since he seized
power in a 1970 coup, was seeking to improve its human rights record
amid Western pressure.
The government has released thousands of prisoners and eased
restrictions on Jews seeking to emigrate, gestures aimed in part at
bettering Syria's relations with the West and opening the door to aid
for the country's anemic economy.
But a report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch said that at the
same time, the regime has been trying hundreds of activists for vague
offenses that include ``opposing any of the goals of the revolution.''
Defendants are denied fair trials and barred from appealing the
sentences, the group said.
``They're sending a strong message to Syrian citizens that peaceful
political action is not going to be tolerated,'' said Virginia Sherry,
an associate director of Human Rights Watch, who spent 48 days in Syria
this spring to compile the report.
The trials have accompanied widespread torture to wrest confessions
from suspected activists, the report said.
Prisoners told the group they were subjected to beatings and electric
shocks. One activist said his fingernails were ripped off.
Some detainees said they were tortured on the ``German chair,'' in
which the victim is tied by the hands and feet to a metal chair with
moving parts. The chair's backrest bends backward, extending the spine
and putting pressure on the neck and limbs.
Other suspects spoke of the ``chicken,'' a revolving wooden bar that
resembles a roasting spit. The victim is strapped to the device and
beaten with sticks by interrogators, the report said.
In response to the report, the Syrian government denied torture was
routine and said 40 security officials had been prosecuted for
mistreating prisoners.
A high-ranking Syrian official acknowledged that some rights have been
curtailed, but stressed that the country was still technically at war
with Israel, despite fitful peace negotiations that have dragged on
since October 1991.
``We have to enforce some restrictions to ensure the stability of the
country and the health of society,'' Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Naser Qadur told Human Rights Watch.
The State Security Court, a three-judge tribunal in Damascus, began
trying political activists, suspected members of unauthorized political
groups and independent critics in earnest in 1992, Human Rights Watch
reported.
At times, the chief judge acted as the prosecutor in court sessions
that lasted as little as five minutes, the report said.
The report was released at a time when many believe the tight state
control of Syrian society is being relaxed, particularly after hundreds
of political prisoners were freed beginning in late 1991.
But Sherry said that after their release, prisoners are subjected to
surveillance, harassment and pressure to become informers.
``Repression has not eased, but the tactics have changed,'' Sherry
said. ``Political space has not opened in Syria.''
