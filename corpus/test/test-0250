Political realities clash with logistics on Bosnia pullout by Philippe
Rater
NATO generals look set to clash head on with the politicians over the
December deadline for peacekeeping troops to quit Bosnia, since
logistics would require the phased pullout to start just as Bosnians
prepare to vote in crucial post war elections.
US Admiral Leighton Smith, the overall commander of the NATO-led
Implementation Force said Monday that it would take "at least four
months" to withdraw all the 60,000 IFOR troops and their equipment by
the December 20 deadline.
This means the pullout must begin in September which is also the month
most often cited as the best time to organise the polls.
The coincidence is inappropriate to say the least, particularly since
Carl Bildt, who is in charge of running the civilian side of the Bosnia
accords, has asked NATO for a reinforced and "very visible" military
presence during the polls.
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which is
organising the elections, is planning for around 4,000 polling centres
and Bildt wants NATO troops to be on hand to guard them.
Bildt said a "visible IFOR presence" was needed not just along
demarcation lines separating the Moslem-Croat Federation from the Serb
Republic, but also in all the main towns of Bosnia-Hercegovina. He said
this was vital to restore the people's confidence and encourage them to
turn out and vote.
NATO has not yet responded to Bildt's request and instead has said that
for the moment the "priority" is to provide transport and
communications equipment to civilian organisations.
However the indications are that NATO is not happy about providing
troops to guard polling stations which it considers is a job for the
police. In the same way, NATO has refused to detach troops to guard
mass graves despite requests from UN officials for IFOR's help to
safeguard evidence of atrocities.
NATO is reluctant to get involved in what it regards as civilian
aspects of the peace process. One specialist said IFOR was not "a
multi-function force" in Bosnia to guard anything and everything.
Admiral Smith said Tuesday that the force would be scaled down starting
in the summer. He said it would be shaped into a more mobile and
lighter force.
On Monday, NATO's supreme commander in Europe, General George Joulwan
hinted in a newspaper interview that NATO might extend its one-year
mandate in Bosnia. He told the Italian Corriere della Sera newspaper
that NATO's commanders would "reexamine the problem" of the mandate's
duration.
And last month Joulwan also appeared to support more IFOR involvement
in civilian efforts to rebuild Bosnia. "I don't call that 'mission
creep', I say that's part of the mission," he said.
However Smith said Tuesday "I'm not prepared to make any
recommendations about stay or go right now." He said the decision would
depend on what happened with the Bosnian elections. But he said the
ultimate goal of an ethnically-integrated Bosnia would not be a
determining factor.
"I don't think we're going to get an integrated society by then," he
said.
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said at the end of March that the
troop withdrawals could only start "after the elections".
An informed source said the United States might not be opposed to
extending the presence of a smaller number of peacekeeping troops in
Bosnia into 1997 for one or two more months.
