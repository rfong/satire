Rapid Development of Beijing's Food Industry 
Local government's departments in Beijing report that in 1995, the
output value of the city's food industry reached 10 billion yuan (1.2
billion US dollars), up by 13 percent over the previous year, and
pre-tax profits edged up by 5.6 percent to 1.1 billion yuan.
Exports were valued at over 100 million US dollars, an increase of 30
percent, showing that the food industry has made great strides in
improving the living standards of local residents.
In 1980, the city's food industry had an output value of only 1.5
billion yuan.
Xinhua has learned that the local government has invested more than six
billion yuan in fixed assets to develop the food industry since 1980,
over 20 times the total for the previous 30 years. The number of
enterprises has increased from 500 to the current 5,000, and the number
of workers from over 50,000 to more than 300,000.
Beijing's food industry has attracted an increasing number of foreign
investors, and there are 906 foreign-funded food companies, involving
1.71 billion US dollars in investment.
