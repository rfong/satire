Trinidad and Tobago Blank St. Vincent,s 5-0 
Trinidad and Tobago trounced St. Vincent 5-0 on Sunday to become the
1995 Caribbean Shell Cup champions. It was Trinidad and Tobago's four
championship and the first time a team has won back-to-back titles in
the Caribbean contest.
Sunday's finalists go forward to the CONCACAF Gold Cup. Trinidad and
Tobago and the tiny island of St. Vincent will compete with 10 other
champions from North and Central America in the Gold Cup, being played
in Los Angeles in January.
Trinidad and Tobago took command from the start of the match, with
Angus Eve scoring in the 36th minute.
The next minute, St. Vincent scored off Dexter Brown, leaving it 2-0 at
halftime. The Trinidad strikers kept constant pressure on St. Vincent,
which put up a good fight despite the 5-0 result.
The most dramatic goal of the entire competition came in the 56th
minute, when Clint Marcelle fired hard and fast from about 20 yards.
Terry St. Louis scored in the 61st minute, and Arnold Dwarika in the
63rd.
In Sunday's second match, for third place, Cuba defeated hosts Cayman
Islands 3-0, rebounding well from a 3-2 upset to St. Vincent last week.
