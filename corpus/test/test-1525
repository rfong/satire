Investor group offers 1.16 billion for Rockefeller Center
Sam Zell, a Chicago property developer, has offered to buy the mortgage
on Rockefeller Center for 1.16 billion dollars, almost all of it in
cash, opening a new chapter in the battle for control of the famed New
York landmark.
The offer came in a letter to Rockefeller Center Properties Inc.
(RCPI), the quoted real estate investment trust which currently holds
the mortgage, Sam Zell's company, Equity Office Holdings, said in a
statement here Friday.
The investor group led by Sam Zell includes the General Electric
conglomerate and Walt Disney Co. It faces two rival offers for control
of the Rockefeller Center, a 12-building office complex in the center
of Manhattan which was put into bankrupcy last year by 80-percent owner
Mitsubishi Estate of Japan.
The new offer by the Zell group offers to purchase the 1.3 billion face
value mortgage for 1.026 billion dollars in cash and a 135 million note
paid to current RCPI shareholders. The note would be secured by a
second mortgage on Rockefeller Center and guaranteed by General
Electric. It would pay 6.5 percent interest and mature in 12 years.
According to EOH, this offer represents a value of nine dollars for
each RCPI share and is "clearly superior" to rival offers.
All previous offers, both by the Zell group and the other bidders,
sought to gain control of the Rockefeller Center indirectly by first
taking a controlling stake in RCPI, to which the center's property
title is due to revert when the bankrupcy proceedings are completed.
The new offer, on the other hand, seeks outright control by buying out
the mortgage and thereby depriving RCPI's current shareholders of any
stake in the future of Rockefeller Center.
Sam Zell said in an interview with CNBC television Friday that his new
offer would be considered Monday by the RCPI board and Manhattan's
bankrupcy court.
The main rival offer comes from Whitehall Street, a limited partnership
real estate investment vehicle controlled by investment bank Goldman
Sachs. It is backed by firms controlled by the Italian Agnelli family
and Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos, as well as US property
developer Tishman Speyer and banker David Rockefeller, whose father
built the office complex in the 1930s. That offer is worth 7.75 dollars
a share, close to the price at which RCPI stock traded Friday.
The third offer comes from Gotham Partners, a current shareholder in
RCPI who is asking other shareholders to back a rights issue in order
to keep control of the property.
