Jiang said China believes such relations have immense potentials.
In addition to the cooperation at the government level, Jiang said,
China is to encourage the enterprises of the two countries to expand
cooperation and make effort to find out more areas of cooperation.
The Chinese government will consider offering its help in those areas

He said Chinese enterprises have established cooperative projects
successfully in Kenya, saying that China's help is valuable since there
is no conditions attached.
