South Africa denies foreign minister will visit Taiwan in May 
The South African embassy in Taiwan on Monday denied press reports that
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo will visit Taipei this month to inform the
government here of Pretoria's decision to switch diplomatic recognition
to China.
"According to our information, Mr. Nzo will visit Taipei in June, and
the exact date of his trip is still under discussion," said Jacob Josua
le Roux, spokesman of the embassy.
He said Nzo absolutely had no plan to visit Taiwan this month.
Le Roux told the official Central News Agency Nzo's Taipei trip is a
"fact-finding" mission similar to his trip to Beijing in March.
South Africa is one of a few nations with diplomatic relations with
Taiwan, but it is interested in establishing official ties with
Taiwan's political rival China. Beijing told Pretoria it would only do
so after South Africa cuts official ties with Taiwan.
The Japanese daily Mainichi Shimbun, quoting Nzo in South Africa,
reported Sunday the foreign minister would visit Taiwan in May and
would be "forced to make a conclusion" on the future of Pretoria's
relations with the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
He refused to say whether his country would cut official ties with
Taiwan, saying only it was one of the options, according to the
Japanese paper, whose report was picked up most newspapers here.
Taiwan's foreign ministry spokesman Rock Leng last week said South
African President Nelson Mandela has remained firm in maintaining
relations with Taiwan.
