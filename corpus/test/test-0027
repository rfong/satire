OIC-Indonesia Indonesia takes over OIC chair, lashes out at Israel 
Indonesia Monday took over the chairmanship of the ministerial
conference of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) for next
year and promptly lashed out at Israel accusing it of blocking the
Middle East peace process.
"In the Middle East the peace process is bogged down in a dangerous
impasse as Israel's acts of provocation indicate that it is renegging
with impunity on its obligation," Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said in a speech at a five-day OIC conference, which started
here Monday.
"Thus bloodshed and violence still marr everyday life in the occupied
territory," said Alatas, who took over the OIC chairmanship from Lamine
Camara of the Republic of Guinea.
Alatas' sharp criticism against Israel reflected sentiments espressed
earlier Monday by President Suharto and OIC Secretary General Hamid
Algabid.
Alatas called for unwavering support for the national rights of the
Palestinians, "particularly through the resumption of negotiations
based on the declaration of principles and subsequent agreements and
the principle of 'land for peace'."
Algabid had blamed the peace stalemate on the government of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for its "non-compliance" with
previous deals.
"The Middle East peace process has been marking time since the
ascension to power of the new government in Israel," he said.
Foreign ministers from the OIC's 53 member nations are attending the
grouping's 24th annual ministerial meet.
