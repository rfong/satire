Firearms and backpacks found by police hunting Australian killer 
A large quantity of firearms, ammunition and camping gear, including
backpacks, has been uncovered during searches of bushland south of
here, police investigating Australia's backpacker murders said Tuesday.
Up to 150 police have continued a minute bushland search since the
arrests of three men on Sunday by members of the police task force
probing the murders of seven hitch-hikers whose remains were found in
the Belanglo State Forest in 1992 and 1993.
But a police spokesman refused to give details of the latest finds,
saying police did not want to compromise the investigation.
"We are not going to speculate on any individual items that have been
seized," police spokesman Kevin Daley said. "They have been taken into
custody and will be examined."
Daley said the searches would continue for "as long as is deemed
necessary", but emphasised that police using metal detectors and
assisted by sniffer dogs were not searching for bodies.
The search was also continuing of the home of Ivan Milat, the first
person arrested.
Milat, accused of trying to abduct and rob a 24-year-old British
tourist at gunpoint near Belanglo forest in 1990, was refused bail
during a court appearance at Campbelltown on Monday.
Two others were released on bail on lesser charges.
The remains of two British women, two Australians and three Germans
were found in the forest between October 1992 and November 1993.
