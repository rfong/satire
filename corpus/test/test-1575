Rwanda Supports DRC Peace Deal
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu has expressed his full support for a
peace deal on the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
reached in Zambian capital Wednesday.
The deal included a commitment to disarm the ethnic Hutu militiamen who
led Rwanda's 1994 genocide, he said in Kigali, capital of Rwanda,
Thursday.
Bizimungu said he would fly to Lusaka, capital of Zambia, Saturday to
attend a summit which will endorse the peace agreement to end the
11-month of war in the third largest African country, a report reaching
here said.
Rwanda has allegedly sent its troops to support rebels in the DRC who
fought against President Laurent Kabila.
But the president has time and again defended the motive behind his
troop-sending as safeguarding the national security of Rwanda, which
is, to fight the Interahamwe militiamen and former Rwandan soldiers who
led the genocide of over 500,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
"As far as Rwanda is concerned, the most interesting aspect of the
agreement is that the countries involved have committed to disarm and
fight the Interahamwe and other genocidal forces, and that was our
objective," he told a news conference.
