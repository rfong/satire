Business forecasts slower industrial output growth in India 
India may experience slower industrial output growth and have a higher
fiscal deficit in the fiscal year to March 1997, an industry body
warned Tuesday.
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assocham),
representing more than 200 companies, said in a mid-year review of the
Indian economy that industrial output growth would drop two percentage
points year-on-year to 10 percent in 1996-97.
"The slow growth is due to high cost of borrowings, infrastructural
bottlenecks, sluggish imports and high cost of crucial inputs such as
petrol, power and freight," Assocham secretary-general V. Raghuraman
said.
The report said that in the four months to September, export growth
fell to 11 percent year-on-year compared to 28 percent growth recorded
a year earlier.
The report said fiscal deficit targetted at five percent of the the
gross domestic product (GDP) for 1996-97 may increase to more than six
percent, or 20 billion dollars.
"The trade deficit at 4.5 billion dollars (for 1995-96) is also likely
to increase to seven billion dollars in 1996-97," it said.
Raghuraman said the trade deficit would widen due to massive increase
in imports of petroleum products. "This will put pressure on the
balance of payments."
The mid-year review also forecast inflation would rise to about nine
percent from five percent in 1995-96.
"Industry today is concerned over the continued downtrend of the
capital markets while the high cost of bank credit and poor
infrastructure are proving to be the bane of economic growth,"
Raghuraman said.
The Assocham report said the government would have to improve fiscal
discipline, cut excise duties and open up the insurance sector to
private firms to boost the economy.
