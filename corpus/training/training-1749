Russia regrets China nuclear test 
Russia voiced regret Friday over a fresh underground nuclear bomb test
in China and appealed to Beijing to refrain from further testing of
atomic weapons, the foreign ministry said.
A ministry spokesman quoted by ITAR-TASS news agency said Moscow
"deeply regrets" the Chinese test conducted earlier Friday and was
"alarmed" because it could also encourage other states to resume
testing in spite of a general moratorium.
"We would like to hope that the Chinese side will understand its
genuine national interests, comply with the appeals of the
international community and together with other nations help achieve
complete termination of underground nuclear tests," the spokesman said.
