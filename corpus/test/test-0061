Police Kill 3 Militants in Southern Egypt 
Three members of an outlawed Islamic extremist group were shot dead in
a police ambush at dawn today in southern Egypt, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported.
The three militants, Mohamed Salam Abdel Nabi, Mohamed Gahmi Abdel
Rehim and Atef Ragab Tughyan, were identified as members of the
al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, the Interior Ministry said.
The security forces found rifles, ammunition, documents and name lists
of some of the Islamic Group's fugitive members during the dawn raid in
their hideouts in al-Minya, 220 kilometers south of Cairo.
Altogether 40 suspected militants have been arrested in recent
assaults, said the ministry.
Four militants were killed last week in Minya as part of a police
campaign to seize and abort terrorist groups in the southern part of
the country.
The Islamic Group has been fighting against the secular government in a
bloody campaign launched by Muslim militants since March 1992 to
install a strict Islamic rule in Egypt.
A total of 1,171 people have been killed in the violence, most of them
militants and policemen.
