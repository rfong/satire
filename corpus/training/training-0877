Malaysian Ship Master Faces Fines 
The master of a Malaysian container ship faces fines of up to 200,000
Australian dollars ( 106,000 U.S. dollars).
The container ship agrounded on a coral reef in a world heritage area
of Australia last Thursday and damaged a swathe of coral measuring 100
meters long by 20 meters wide.
The Australian Associated Press quoted Environment Minister Rod Welford
Thursday as saying that Queenslan officers Friday would interview the
master and first officer of the 21,000 ton ship.
"Queensland takes very seriously its protection of the Great Barrier
Reef and we cannot let this sort of environmental accident occur in a
World Heritage area without taking appropriate action," the minister
said.
An official from the ministry said the master could be fined up to
100,000 Australian dollars (53,000 U.S. dollars ) for navigating in a
habitat protection zone of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and
another 100,000 Australian dollars for damaging coral in the zone.
Salvage crews failed so far to refloat the ship.
