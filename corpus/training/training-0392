Nigeria's Former Army Chief under House Arrest 
Nigeria's former Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi has been
put under house arrest to help with the on- going investigations into a
spate of killings which took place under the late military ruler Gen.
Sani Abacha, a newspaper reported here Sunday.
"This Day" quoted presidency sources as saying that although the former
army chief had not been directly implicated in the killings, one of his
security officers had already been linked to at least two of the
assassinations.
Military sources told the paper that the security officer was hardly
around Army Headquarters as he was often said to be on "special
assignments" .
Mohammed Sani Abacha, son of the late Gen. Sani Abacha, and four others
appeared last thursday before a Lagos court to be charged with
murdering former Chief of Staff Major General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua and
wife of the late politician Moshood Kashimawo Abiola, acclaimed winner
of the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election.
The official newspaper "New Nigerian" Sunday also quoted sources as
saying that all the mysterious deaths of Nigerians in the past 15 years
of military rule would be probed by the Olusegun Obasanjo's
administration.
