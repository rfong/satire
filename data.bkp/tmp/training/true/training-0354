``/`` I/PRP want/VBP to/TO extend/VB my/PRP$ congratulations/NNS to/TO President/NNP Bill/NNP Clinton/NNP being/VBG elected/VBN for/IN -LRB-/-LRB- a/SYM -RRB-/-RRB- second/JJ term/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP President/NNP Clinton/NNP is/VBZ a/DT warm/JJ friend/NN of/IN Israel/NNP and/CC the/DT Jewish/JJ people/NNS ./.

Netanyahu/NNP said/VBD that/IN he/PRP expected/VBD Clinton/NNP 's/POS re-election/NN would/MD make/VB it/PRP easier/RBR to/TO ensure/VB the/DT continuation/NN of/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP peace/NN process/NN ,/, while/IN believing/VBG that/IN the/DT much-expected/JJ U.S./NNP pressure/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB applied/VBN ./.

``/`` We/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG forward/RB to/TO working/VBG with/IN the/DT new/JJ ,/, old/JJ if/IN you/PRP want/VBP ,/, American/NNP Administration/NNP on/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN extending/VBG peace/NN in/IN the/DT -LRB-/-LRB- Middle/NNP East/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- area/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN doing/VBG this/DT consistently/RB over/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ months/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP intend/VBP to/TO do/VB it/PRP in/IN the/DT coming/JJ days/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN coming/VBG months/NNS and/CC years/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP asserted/VBD ./.

Ross/NNP returned/VBD home/NN last/JJ week/NN after/IN the/DT failure/NN to/TO secure/VB a/DT Hebron/NNP deal/NN ,/, despite/IN three/CD weeks/NNS of/IN intensive/JJ mediation/NN ./.

Once/RB again/RB ,/, Netanyahu/NNP called/VBD on/IN Syria/NNP to/TO resume/VB peace/NN negotiations/NNS with/IN Israel/NNP ./.

He/PRP said/VBD that/IN Syria/NNP and/CC other/JJ parties/NNS in/IN the/DT Arab/JJ world/NN should/MD understand/VB that/IN ``/`` the/DT date/NN of/IN the/DT American/JJ elections/NNS does/VBZ not/RB materially/RB change/VB their/PRP$ need/NN and/CC responsibility/NN to/TO enter/VB negotiations/NNS ./. ''/''

Meanwhile/RB ,/, U.S./NNP Ambassador/NNP to/TO Israel/NNP Martin/NNP Indyk/NNP confirmed/VBD that/IN the/DT Clinton/NNP government/NN would/MD continue/VB playing/VBG the/DT role/NN of/IN facilitator/NN in/IN the/DT peace/NN talks/NNS ,/, ruling/VBG out/RP any/DT changes/NNS in/IN the/DT U.S./NNP policy/NN regarding/VBG its/PRP$ involvement/NN in/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN ./.

Indyk/NNP believed/VBD an/DT Israeli-Palestinian/JJ deal/NN was/VBD imminent/JJ ./.

``/`` The/DT issues/NNS can/MD be/VB resolved/VBN ,/, and/CC we/PRP are/VBP close/JJ to/TO the/DT resolution/NN ./.
