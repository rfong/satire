Drug enforcement authorities have seized 12 tonnes of hashish from a
container at the Karachi port, the official Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP) news agency reported Saturday.
The container was brought to the southern port from the city of
Faisalabad in eastern Pakistan for shipment to the Netherlands, the
agency said.
The report, which did not give details, said the authorities acted on a
tipoff about the attempt to smuggle the consignment with the help of
fictitious documents.
The drug enforcement officials estimated the value of the hashish at
around 15 million dollars on the clandestine international drug market.
