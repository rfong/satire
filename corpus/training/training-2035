Chinese Player Upsets World No. 1 Suprianto
Chinese Lin Liwen came out to be Wednesday's superstar by ousting world
top seed Joko Suprianto of Indonesia with straight sets at the All
England Badminton Championships.
At the men's singles action this evening, the 27-year-old Chinese
shuttler staged an excelllent fight against the Indonesian ace player,
who has made a dramatic comeback over the past months by holding the
world number one spot.
Lin, also in prime form, was patient in displaying his adroit defensive
skills and spared no efforts in fighting back.
After losing the first set 15:11, Suprianto pulled himself together to
launch a counter-offensive in an effort to turn the tables, but Lin
stepped up pressure and finally won a landslide victory 15:2.
In another men's singles third-round match, Lin's teammate Yu Lizhi was
a step away to follow suit in a clash against Olympic Champion Allen
Budi Kusuma. Unfortunately, Yu was unable to resist the powerful
smashes and lost the game by a margin of only two points.
In the women's singles events, Chinese world Champion Ye Zhaoying
enjoyed a smooth sailing into the third round by trouncing her Russian
opponent in 16 minutes.
Other Chinese women singles players Han Jingna, Zhang Ning and Dai Yuan
also won their games in straignt sets.
However, in the mixed doubles competition, which lasted into late
night, world number two combination Liu Jianjun and Sun Man were ousted
by a pair of Swedish players.
Meanwhile, Tao Xiaoqiang and Wang Xiaoyuan of China gained their berth
at the semi-final to be held on Thursday.
