Cooperation Benefits Egypt, China: Egyptian 
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri said Monday that
Egyptian-Chinese cooperation in developing the special economic zone to
the north of the Suez Gulf benefits the two countries.
After a meeting with Chinese Minister in charge of State Development
Planning Commission Zeng Peiyan, El-Ganzouri told Xinhua that the
establishment of joint ventures in the economic zone is a new way of
economic cooperation.
He appreciated the close political, trade and cultural ties enjoyed by
the two countries since they established diplomatic relations in 1956.
Meanwhile, Zeng told reporters that China is to upgrade part facilities
of the zone and set up a number of plants to produce electrical
equipment, spinning and weaving products.
Zeng arrived here last Friday for a week-long visit, during which he
will hold talks with Egyptian officials on steps to promote the
cooperation in upgrading the industrial zone.
China signed the memorandum of understanding in 1997 with Egypt to help
it establish its first special economic zone with China's experience in
this regard.
