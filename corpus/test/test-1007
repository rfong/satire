UK Business Failures on Rise 
Business failures in Britain have increased to their highest level in
seven years, as a new survey showed that 11,741 firms went bust in the
three months July to September, the worst figure since 16,000 failed in
the Summer of 1992.
"Although there has been a rise in business confidence amongst almost
all sectors of the economy, these figures illustrate the downside of
the very tight profit margins under which many companies are having to
operate," said Philip Mellor, senior analyst at Dun &AMP; Bradstreet,
which undertook the survey.
The number of business failures has been accelerating, with the
underlying rate rising by 13.2 percent for the nine months of this
year, compared to 10.7 percent for the first six months of the year.
So far this year, 33,000 businesses have failed, about 850 every week,
according to the survey.
Although the UK economy is now improving, with economic growth
predicted to reach 1.5 percent this year, it is clear that pricing
pressures are putting many firms' profits at risk.
With inflation at 2.1 percent, companies are finding that customers are
refusing to pay higher prices in the shops. And the availability of
cheap imports from abroad, helped by the high pound, has also pushed
down manufacturers' margins.
The figures will add to pressures for the Bank of England to refrain
from further interest rate rises when its Monetary Policy Committee
makes its decision on Thursday, according to analysts.
However, the picture for manufacturing industry remains mixed. Recent
surveys of business confidence suggest that most British companies are
becoming more optimistic about the future.
There are strong regional variations in the rate of business failure,
with the relatively prosperous South-East contrasting with high rates
of failure in Wales, the Midlands, and the North-East.
In London there was actually a decline in business failures, with 4.8
percent fewer firms going bust. And in the South-East, there were only
6.8 percent more failures, half the national average.
By contrast, there was a massive 35 percent increase in Welsh firms
failing so far this year, compared with the previous nine months.
Also hard hit was the East Midlands, where failures increased by 25.9
percent this year.
