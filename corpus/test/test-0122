Tanzanian Police Seize 163 Stolen Vehicles 
Tanzanian police have impounded 163 stolen automobiles in a special
crackdown earlier this week, the Director of Criminal Investigation
Adadi Rajabu said Saturday.
Of the total, 82 are alleged to have been stolen in Tanzania, 79 from
South Africa, one from Malawi and one from Swaziland, Rajabu told
reporters at the Oysterbay Police Station where the seized vehicles of
different makes are parked.
In the swoop, Rajabu said, 17 suspects along with 27 guns were
arrested.
Police officers from different Southern African Development Community
(SADC) countries have cooperated in the exercise, carried out during
August 24-27, according to the director.
Statistics show that about two to three vehicles are stolen every week,
a rate which Rajabu described as lower than that of other countries.
However, he cautioned that "effective measures must be taken to keep
the car theft trend downwards."
