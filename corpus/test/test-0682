Mandela on S. Africa's Finance 
The manner in which South Africa has ridden out the financial
turbulence of the past few months would benefit the lives of all people
and add impetus to economic growth and job creation, President Nelson
Mandela said.
He also praised the major banks for deciding to cut interest rates in
the country.
Mandela made the remarks at a function in Pretoria last night to mark
the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Reserve Bank, the central
bank of South Africa.
A local daily ''the Citizen'' today quoted the president as saying that
the environment in which the bank operated gave little room for error,
but the experience it has acquired over the decades has stood the bank
and the country in good stead.
Referring to the major devaluation of the local currency Rand against
foreign currencies earlier this year and the decision of major
commercial banks to increase interest rates last month, Mandela said
South Africa has had its share of ''rude shocks'', but the finance
ministry and the Reserve Bank has come out of the crises ''with flying
colors''.
In this regard, Mandela said the stability that has set in and the
ensuring decision taken by the major banks this week to reduce rates
would not only impact on the material lives of all citizens, but also
add impetus to the government's efforts of ensuring rapid economic
growth and the creation of much-needed jobs.
However, Mandela also urged the Reserve Bank to employ more people from
the country's various race groups.
''One of the greatest challenges now facing the bank today is to ensure
that its staff complement, at all levels, reflects the diversity of our
country,'' said the president, adding steps already taken in this
regard are encouraging.
