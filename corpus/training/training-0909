Romania denies interfering in Moldova's affairs 
Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase on Monday denied interfering in
the affairs of neighbouring Moldova, amid a row sparked by the
introduction of Russian-language classes in the ex-Soviet republic.
Moldovan Prime Minister Vassili Tarlev accused Nastase at the weekend
of having "forgotten that Moldova is a sovereign and independent state"
amid the row over the country, much of which belonged to Romania before
World War I.
"I do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of Moldova and I
have never done it," said Nastase. "It is normal that every country
makes its own decisions.
"But the inhabitants of this republic are a cause of concern which we
cannot ignore," he added, cited by the Mediafax news agency.
The row comes after Romania publicly criticized Moldovan authorities
for having made Russian-language lessons obligatory in primary schools,
which was followed by the banning of a Moldovan party that opposed the
move.
Most of Moldova's territory belonged to Romania before its annexation
by the Soviet Union in 1939 under a pact between Moscow and Nazi
Germany, but two thirds of the country still speaks Moldovan, which is
the same as Romanian.
Russian language classes resumed in the primary school curriculum at
the beginning of the year, after they were stopped following Moldovan
independence in 1991.
The Moldovan Communist Party, which came to power last year under
President Vladimir Voronin, favours a reunification with Moscow by the
country, Europe's poorest.
