Northerners want to blockade and not capture Aden 
Northern forces loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh aim to blockade
the southern bastion of Aden but not capture it, Yemeni Foreign
Minister Mohammad Bassandawa said Monday.
"The priority is not to capture Aden but to put it under blockade, by
controlling its entries and surrounding heights," Bassandawa, a
northerner loyal to the president, told the Qatari newspaper Al-Sharq.
The northern army would not try to capture Aden, a stronghold of Vice
President Ali Salem al-Baid, to "save human lives and vital economic
facilities" in the southern port city.
"Toppling the separatist clique within the Yemeni Socialist Party" of
Baid "is the responsibility of the people, the leaders and the unionist
militants of the YSP and their armed forces," Bassandawa said.
His comments came as Saleh's forces, fighting an all-out war against
Baid's since May 5, were reported Sunday to be advancing on Aden.
Bassandawa repeated that Baid and his followers should be brought to
court "for plotting against the unity" of Yemen.
North and South Yemen merged into a single state four years ago.
He reiterated the north's rejection of an Arab military intervention to
stop the fighting, saying this would mean a "recognition of an entity
led by the rebels."
