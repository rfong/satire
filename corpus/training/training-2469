US judge has "grave doubts" over jurisdiction in Afghan detainees case 
A US judge asked to decide if prisoners from the US war in Afghanistan
detained in Cuba are being treated illegally said Tuesday he had "grave
doubts" whether he had jurisdiction over the case.
Federal Judge Howard Matz had been asked by a group of human rights
advocates to order 110 suspected members of the Taliban and al-Qaeda
being held in Cuba to appear in a US civil court and state the charges
against them.
At Tuesday's hearing here, Matz heard arguments whether he should have
jurisdiction in the case brought by a group of clergy, journalists and
lawyers on behalf of the 110 detainees.
In what is seen as a crucial test of the US government's handling of
the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks on US targets, the
judge has been asked to decide if the detainees' custody violates the
US Constitution and Geneva Convention.
Setting a new hearing date for February 14, Matz gave the government
until January 31 to respond to the group's writ and in turn gave the
group's attorney until February 7 to counter the government's response.
Some 158 detainees transferred from the US military theater in
Afghanistan are being held in the maximum security Camp X-Ray prison
built on the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in southeastern Cuba.
Washington has classed the captives as illegal combatants, not
prisoners of war, effectively denying them rights under the 1949 Geneva
Convention on the laws of war, provoking international concerns over
their treatment.
The legal move is the first challenge to the Bush administration's
decision to hold the prisoners at Guantanamo.
The court is also expected to rule whether the suspects were allegedly
fighting for a government or a terrorist organization.
