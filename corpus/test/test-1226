Indonesian Election Conducted Orderly: EU Monitors 
Indonesia's general election has been conducted in an orderly manner,
election monitors from the European Union (EU) told reporters here
Monday.
The monitors, however, noted that the number of polling stations they
have seen might not be representative of the total number of polling
stations throughout the country.
Chairman of the EU monitoring team John Gwyn Morgan of Britain said
that polling at three stations in Jakarta had been conducted according
to the procedure.
The infrastructures were adequate, he said, adding that he had only
monitored three polling stations.
Morgan praised the local election committees and the voters for
exercising their respective tasks enthusiastically.
Separately, General Election Commission (KPU) member Adnan Buyung
Nasution said that the election held on Monday ran a bit rough since
some of the personnel involved were not well equipped and trained to
conduct the polling process.
In some areas, disagreements between polling station officials and
non-registered voters occurred, but none led to more serious conflicts
due to fast anticipation by sub-district election officers.
Similar misunderstanding has caused a polling station burnt down by 200
angry non-registered voters in Kemuning village in Tanggerang, about 30
kilometers south of Jakarta.
In some districts, Nasution said, inks and forms for the election were
either not supplied or not enough, causing some delays in the voting
process.
Lack of forms occurred in Jakarta and Nusa Tenggara Timur too, but not
serious enough to cause any meaningful delay, Nasution said.
He told reporters that the preliminary results of the election from
areas are expected on Monday night.
