Asked if Huang's 1994 appointment to a senior post at the Commerce
Department had been a mistake, he said, "I don't think so, as long as the
clearances and the search of all the records and business disclosures
... were all appropriate."
Huang, who was born in China but immigrated to the United States in
1969, left Commerce in January to become the DNC's chief fundraiser
among Asian-Americans.
Clinton said he viewed Huang's international connections and business
clout as an asset at Commerce, making him "the sort of person we'd be
looking for" to open up new international markets.
The DNC recently suspended Huang from his fundraising post and asked
the watchdog Federal Election Commission to investigate his fundraising
activities.
Separately, the president called for a rapid Israeli-Palestinian accord
on Hebron and a tough line on Iraq, and announced the appointment of
senior aide Erskine Bowles to replace White House chief of staff Leon
Panetta.
While the campaign-finance imbroglio failed to keep Clinton from
winning a second term, his re-election hasn't dampened scrutiny by
reporters and Republicans of DNC donations.
"I think we have to find out what happened there," Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott said this week, after his party shored up control of
Congress and called for an independent probe of the DNC contributions.
But the Republican from Mississippi spoke carefully of the need for
broad reform of federal campaign-finance laws, clearly mindful that
both parties have interpreted existing laws to their advantage.
