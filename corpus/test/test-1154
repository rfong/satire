Havel to Appoint Zeman as Premier 
Czech President Vaclav Havel announced Thursday that he will appoint
the central leftist Social Democrat Party (CSSD) leader Milos Zeman as
the new prime minister.
Havel said at a press conference that before making the appointment, he
will accept the resignation of Josef Tosovsky's caretaker government,
and discuss the new cabinet line-up with Zeman.
The CSSD, meanwhile, signed a surprise deal with the right-wing Civic
Democratic Party (ODS) to form a minority government, sharing the power
of government and parliament between them.
Under the deal, which was immediately criticized as "political
trickery," Klaus, hitherto Zeman's arch rival on the Czech political
stage, will be given for his party the posts of speakers in the two
houses of parliament.
The ODS agreed not to dissolve parliament by bringing a no-confidence
motion.
It also gives the ODS the chairmanship of the key parliamentary budget
committee.
Last month's ballots gave the CSSD 74 seats in the 200-seat parliament,
against 63 for the ODS.
