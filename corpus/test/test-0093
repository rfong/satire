Censorship on rise in China, film-maker Zhang Yimou says 
Chinese film-maker Zhang Yimou has spoken out strongly against growing
censorship in China, which he said was taking place amid an icy
political climate and rigid ideological control.
In an interview appearing Wednesday in the weekly Die Zeit, he said
impressions were misleading: "In reality, the censorship is becoming
ever more harsh."
Some films had been cut and changed, others not shown at all, said
Zhang, who was prevented by the authorities from screening his latest
film at the Cannes Festival. "One feels an icy atmosphere in China at
present," he said.
Zhang added that he believed some well-known Chinese films would have
no chance today of getting past the censors.
"What you are seeing is certainly an opening up of China, but this is
taking place only in the economy and the consumer domain," he said.
"Ideologically and spiritually, people today experience massive
control. This is especially severe in the case of films. In music,
painting and literature the pressure is much less.
"Film is something special because it reaches so many people. That is
why the authorities are especially tough."
