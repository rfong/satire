North Korean-trained Filipino communist rebel leader surrenders 
The North Korean-trained head of an urban death squad loyal to exiled
Filipino communist party chief Jose Maria Sison has surrendered in
another major blow to the waning 25-year insurgency, the military said
Friday.
Lucio Borlaza, 33, who carried a one million-peso (37,000-dollar)
reward for his capture as chief of the Edgar Jopson Brigade, had
earlier surrendered to the human rights commission. He was presented to
the media at military headquarters on Friday.
Military officials said Borlaza was among 11 guerrillas of the New
People's Army (NPA), armed wing of the underground Communist Party of
the Philippines (CPP), who was trained in North Korea in 1987 and among
the best in "special partisan operations."
He was involved in a campaign in the mid-1980s in which hundreds of
guerrillas suspected of being government agents were executed.
Armed forces chief General Arturo Enrile granted Borlaza a safe conduct
pass. He also said that no criminal charges have been filed against him
and that he could apply for amnesty under a program initiated by
President Fidel Ramos.
Military officials say the NPA strength has been reduced to only 8,000
fighters from a peak of 25,000 in 1985.
