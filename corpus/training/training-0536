Taiwanese aborigines demonstrate for land, autonomy 
About 500 aborigines from Taiwan's original 10 tribes demonstrated
outside the president's office Thursday, demanding land of their own,
more autonomous rule, and a new name for their people.
Chanting slogans the protesters, some in colorful tribal costumes,
walked from parliament to the nearby presidential office, as hundreds
of police armed with shields and water cannons stood by.
The demonstrators prayed, read the Bible and sang and danced on the
boulevard after being prevented from approaching the office of
President Lee Teng-hui by rolls of barbed wire in their path.
They urged the authorities to give them land by establishing
"reservations" for them and to grant them the power to administer their
own people's affairs.
They also asked the government to use the name "original inhabitants"
when referring to them, rather than the usually-used "mountain people".
There are about 300,000 aborigines in Taiwan.
