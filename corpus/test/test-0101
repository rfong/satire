Spectacular start to Nigeria's World Cup adventure by Erskine McCullough 
Nigeria's World Cup adventure got off to a spectacular start when they
overran hapless Bulgaria 3-0 in their opening Group D match here
Tuesday evening.
It was a perfect debut for the African champions, who had promised they
would be the surprise team of the tournament.
Nigeria's fast-running front line proved too much for Bulgaria, who are
now in their sixth appearance in the World Cup finals and have still to
win a match.
But Nigeria's Dutch coach Clemens Westerhof admitted afterwards that
his team could easily have lost the match in a shaky opening 10
minutes.
"They were nervous at the start and Bulgaria had two great chances.
Goalkeeper Peter Rufai saved us, no doubt. If they had scored early,
the result could have been different," he said.
"However there is no doubt that while Bulgaria might have had the
better players we had the best team," he added.
Once Nigeria did settle down, Bulgaria were gradually eased out of the
match and the question left to answer was how many goals Nigeria would
score.
"Some of our players did not play the way they could. After the second
goal the players lost confidence," said Bulgarian coach Dimitar Penev.
Nigeria opened the scoring in the 20th minute when George Findini, who
posed all sorts of problems for the Bulgarian defence, broke down the
right, cut into the area and crossed to Rashidi Yekini alone in front
of the goal for the simplest of goals.
Three minutes before half-time Daniel Amokachi escaped his marker in
the area, took the ball to the left and and fired home a blistering
left footed shot.
The icing on the cake came 11 minutes into the second half, when
Findini again used his speed to break free on the right. His far post
cross was met by a diving Emmanuel Amunike, whose header gave keeper
and captain Borislav Mikhailov no chance.
