ECOWAS Urged to Help Restore Peace in Congo (B) 
West African leaders, who are busy exploring ways to settle the Sierra
Leone crisis after normalcy returned to Liberia, have been called on to
help restore peace to troubled Congo Brazzaville.
Gabonese President Omar Bongo, who is the chairman of the mediation
committee on the Congolese crisis characterized by factional fighting,
made the appeal in a message to the sub-regional summit scheduled to
end tonight.
According to the Gabonese leader, the hostilities between forces loyal
to President Pascal Lissouba and the militia of former president Denis
Sassou Nguesso are threatening to engulf the sub-region despite the
relentless efforts of the committee.
With the escalating tension, he warned, the situation could deteriorate
into a crisis of "immense magnitude".
He therefore urged the on-going summit to demonstrate solidarity with
the Congolese people by appealing for the return of peace and normalcy.
The message was read by Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou, acting executive
secretary of the Economic Community of West African States.
