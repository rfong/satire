Clinton, Barak Exchange Letters on Mideast Peace 
President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak have
exchanged letters exploring prospects for peacemaking in the Middle
East, the White House said on Monday.
Clinton wrote Barak over the weekend, responding to a letter the prime
minister sent him about week earlier, White House National Security
Council spokesman David Leavy said.
The two leaders also spoke twice last week on the telephone as Clinton
tries to set the stage for a successful trip by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to the region starting on September 1.
The Palestinians have criticized Barak for stretching out the phases of
an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank under the
U.S.-brokered Wye River agreement.
But Clinton told a group of American Jewish leaders last week at the
White House he expected an agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians on a schedule within three weeks.
