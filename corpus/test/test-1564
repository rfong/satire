Missing Norwegian rowers found safe 
Two Norwegians missing on an attempt to row across the North Sea were
found safe and sound Thursday by a fishing boat 136 kilometers (85
miles) east of the Shetland Islands, the British Coast Guard said.
Trygve Norman Michelsen, 34, and Audun Nordhus, 39, left Haugesund,
north of Stavanger in southern Norway last Wednesday to row to Lerwick
in the Shetlands, a distance of about 425 kilometers (250 miles).
The rowers were found in a liferaft by the fishing boat Helene,
distressed and dehydrated but otherwise well, the Coast Guard said.
"According to the fishermen on the Helene the men are having a shower
and a cup of coffee," said a Coast Guard spokesman, who added it was as
yet unclear what had happened to them.
Their row boat was found overturned earlier Thursday, the life raft and
survival suits missing.
A spokesman for the search and rescue co-ordination centre in Stavanger
said both men would be taken by coastguard helicopter to Haugesund
where they would be given a hospital check-up.
"Considering what they have gone through they are fairly well," he
said.
