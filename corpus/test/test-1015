Karachi killings continue, peace talks remain deadlocked 
Snipers shot dead one person early Sunday, following eight killings the
previous day, in the continuing spiral of violence in this Pakistani
port, police and hospital sources said.
The latest victim, a civilian, was hit in the suburban neighbourhood of
Korangi, one of several troubled parts of the city.
Four of the eight people killed on Saturday were kidnapped and their
mutilated bodies later found in sacks. Others were targeted and shot
dead by unidentifed gunmen, police said.
Meanwhile, talks remained deadlocked between the government and
Karachi's ethnic opposition group, the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM).
The negotiations were halted at the end of July after four unproductive
rounds.
Press reports Sunday quoted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto as saying the
government was willing to settle with the MQM provided it "quits the
politics of violence."
The MQM represents the large community of Urdu speakers who fled to
Karachi after the subcontinent split in 1949. The group claims the
violence stems from government discrimination against the Mohajirs in
employment and politics.
More than 2,000 people have been killed in the past 20 months in
Karachi, Pakistan's commercial and economic hub.
The MQM has called for a greater share of government jobs for Mohajirs
and a municipal election in Sindh province, where Karachi is the
capital. It is also demanding the dropping of criminal charges against
its leaders and the release of jailed party members.
The party is led by Altaf Hussain, who has been living in London for
the last three years.
