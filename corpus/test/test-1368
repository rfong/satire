Hillary Broke! Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Looms! No Help From Bill!
Citing major financial shortfalls from her failed Presidential run,a
spokesman for Senator Hillary Clinton said today she may wind up broke and
penniless.
"Her husband wants no part of this mess," a source close to the
situation said,"she got herself into this situation, and she can just
get herself out of it! Bill doesn't like to hang around with losers!"
(ed. note: could have fooled me!)
The Clinton camp is already furious that Senator Barack Obama, the
party's choice for President, has refused to help on the bail out, and
referred her to Democratic Senate banking member, Barney Frank,D. Ma,
who recently shifted the nation's bad debts on to the shoulders of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, further impacting the US's economic
decline.
Insiders say that Speaker of the House, Nancy Peolosi may consider an
earmark to cover the $15 million debt on her "Save Dole Pineapple"
legislation pending in Congress now.
Senator Frank was unavailable for comment, already embroiled in another
controversy as he considers taking responsibility for Senator John
Edward's love child, along with several others in the Democratic Party,
including Eliot Spitzer, and former Senator Gary Hart as they vie for
"Most Virile Democrat."
Concerned Democrats are projecting a Dooms Day scenario as the
Democratic Convention gets underway in Colorado this week. Many Hillary
Supporters are pushing the Senator to do a Lieberman and switch to the
Republican Party, and take her 18 million votes with her...leaving her
husband behind.They feel her own party has dissed her, just like they
did with Al in Connecticut,but she could rise from the ashes and seek
REVENGE , a Clinton trademark.
Unconfirmed reports had the Senator having a secret meeting with Carl
Rove, Republican king(queen) maker, and party strategist, in a
Starbucks on 42nd Street in NYC, a place where none of the patrons
would recognize their own Senator, and did not speak English.
It has been reported that the Clintons have taken in over a hundred
million dollars in donations and fees since Bill Clinton left the White
House, most from middle eastern states that supply the majority of the
oil to the US. Rumors are THAT cash cow will be shut off in favor of
Barack Hussein Obamba who's persona, ego,hubris and religious leanings
are more in line with the current ruling class in the shiekdoms.
Those in the know said that Hillary's windfall profits from her
Whitewater investments are long gone. Other wags say that when her
confidant Vince Foster allegedly committed suicide in a Washington
Park, he took a long list of account numbers and passwords to offshore
bank accounts with him.
Feminists close to the Senator are urging her to file for divorce and
go after her husband's assets, citing the recent Paul McCartney
settlement ruling, they said she could get millions, and it wouldn't
cost her an arm or a LEG to get her rightful share. There are concerns
however, that full disclosure could land both of the Clintons in a
Federal Pen. Insiders say Bill Clinton would cave in and settle
peacefully rather than serve time playing a secondary role in the
remake of "Deliverance" and becoming the butt of jokes.
Republican Presidential Hopeful Senator John McCain had one comment
about the Clinton Financial Dilemma: "PRICELESS!"
