9 Hostages in Fiji Released 
Nine hostages in Fiji were released early Wednesday morning, according
to the Australian Broadcasting Company.
The released hostages, including two ministers of the toppled Chaudhry
government and some parliament members, will have a health check before
going back home.
Eighteen hostages are still held in the parliament complex.
Former ethnic Indian prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry and about 40
cabinet members and parliament members were taken hostage on May 19 by
an armed group headed by businessman George Speight.
It was scheduled the Great Council of Chiefs in the country will meet
Thursday to select a president and voice president. According to an
agreement signed on Sunday between Speight and the military
authorities, all hostages will be released on the same day.
Upsets spread over the country in the past few days as Speight' s
supporters had occupied police stations and a power station.
