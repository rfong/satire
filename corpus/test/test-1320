Canadian PM to visit Bosnia Thursday 
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien is to visit Bosnia Thursday,
where Canada has some 2,000 troops serving with the United Nations,
official sources said in Paris.
Chretien will be accompanied by the chief of state of the Canadian
armed forces, General John Chastelain, the Canadian embassy in France
said Wednesday.
No details of the trip, his first since the start of the conflict more
than two years ago, were being released for security reasons, the
embassy said.
Canadian UN troops are mostly deployed in central Bosnia with a major
base at the Moslem held town of Visoko, west of Sarajevo.
It was possible Chretien would also visit Sarajevo to meet Bosnian
government officials, officials said.
On Wednesday, UN special representative for the former Yugoslavia,
Yasushi Akashi, announced that both sides in the Bosnian war -- the
Bosnian Serbs and the Moslem-Croat federation -- had agreed to a
four-week truce starting Friday.
Chretien has been in Europe to attend ceremonies commemorating the 50th
anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy and a meeting of
French-speaking countries at Poitiers, France.
