Swiss Lawyer Named U.N. War Crimes Prosecutor 
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday appointed Switzerland's
attorney-general, Carla Del Ponte, to the position of the prosecutor of
the U.N. war crimes tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
The 15-nation Council, in a unanimous resolution, endorsed the
nomination by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last week.
Del Ponte will take up her new post on September 15, when Louise Arbour
of Canada, who has been U.N. prosecutor since October 1996, steps down
to be a judge on Canada's Supreme Court.
The prosecutor normally serves a four-year term and is eligible for
re-election.
The resolution, adopted at a brief meeting, noted Arbour's resignation
"with regret." Arbour was rejected entry into Kosovo, a Serbian
province, by Yugoslavia earlier this year when she tried to investigate
alleged atrocities in the province.
The U.N. tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, set up in January 1991, is
based in the Hague. The Rwanda tribunal, seated at Arusha, Tanzania,
was founded to prosecute leaders of the 1994 Hutu-led genocide of
minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
Del Ponte, 52, has been Switzerland's attorney-general since April
1994.
