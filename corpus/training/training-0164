India's New Guidelines to Attract Foreign Investment 
The Indian Industry Ministry on Monday issued some new guidelines
designed to attract badly-needed foreign direct investment, the local
press reported today.
According to the new guidelines, foreign companies will be allowed to
set up wholly-owned subsidiaries provided they are bringing in
propriety technology, the products will be exported or if the
investment is in the field of consultancy, power, road, ports and
industrial estates.
These should be done keeping in view the special requirements and merit
of each case, the guidelines said.
If a foreign company is unable to identify an Indian joint venture
partner, the guidelines said, India's Foreign Investment Promotion
Board (FIPB) may allow 100 percent equity on the condition that 26
percent is sold to a partner or to the public within a period of three
to five years.
The guidelines also pointed out that if an Indian partner of a joint
venture is unable to raise the resources for expansion, FIPB may
recommend an increase in the foreign partner equity to 100 percent.
In the non-banking financial services category, foreign equity of up to
51 percent has been allowed, and no special conditions are attached
except those requiring approval of the Securities and Exchange Board of
India, the guidelines said.
