U.N. to Set Up Buffer Zone Between Ethiopia, Eritrea 
The United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) has
presented its assessment of the redeployment plan to Ethiopia and
Eritrea for the establishment of a buffer zone between the two
countries.
A UNMEE press release said Tuesday that Joseph Legwaila, U.N. special
representative to the mission, traveled to both countries' capitals to
present the document to Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and
Eritrean President Issaias Afwerki.
The drafting and implementing of the assessment document, a " good
faith" effort as called by the release, is aimed at delimiting the
Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) between the two countries.
Under the framework of the assessment, Major General Patrick Cammaert,
UNMEE force commander, will convene a meeting of the Military
Coordination Commission (MCC) on February 6 in Nairobi, Kenya to work
out the modalities for setting up the TSZ.
The prospective TSZ is designed to detach military forces of Ethiopia
and Eritrea, and allow U.N. peacekeepers to carry out their mandate
under the peace agreement signed by the two countries last December.
The majority of the 4,200-member UN peacekeeping force will be
positioned in the TSZ, said the news release, adding more than 3, 500
peacekeepers have already been in place.
