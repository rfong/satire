Curcija scores hat-trick for Australia 
Michael Curcija scored a hat-trick to lead Australia to a 4-1 thrashing
of Brazil on Saturday and secured a place in the quarter-finals in the
World Student Games football tournament.
Curcija, the hero in Tuesday's victory against the 1993 Games bronze
medallists Britain, shot a 28th-minute penalty equalizer and another
penalty in the 41st.
Forward James Aschner, who produced a heading chance for Curcija's
hat-trick in the 51st minute, completed the scoring in the 59th minute
when he dribbled through for home.
With the win, Australia, who were bottom at 16th in Buffalo two years
ago, finished second earning four points from two wins, no draw and one
defeat in Group D and advanced to the next round with Ukraine, the 2-1
winners over Britain to stand with a 2-1-0 record.
Top two finishers from four preliminary groups moved into the
quarter-finals, with hosts Japan, South Africa, Iran, the Czech
Republic, South Korea and Russia also advancing.
Japan powered past Slovakia 5-2 for a 2-1-0 record to finish atop Group
A, followed by South Africa, who defeated Canada 2-1 for a 2-0-1.
Iran blanked Urguay 3-0 for a 2-1-0, while defending champions, the
Czech Republic, were held to a 2-2 draw by Ireland for a 1-2-0 in Group
B.
In Group C, South Korea drew with Russia 0-0 with both finishing on a
2-1-0 record, while the United States punished Nigeria 2-1.
