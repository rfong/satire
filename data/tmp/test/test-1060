``/`` Our/PRP$ first/JJ objective/NN is/VBZ to/TO stop/VB the/DT sale/NN ,/, ''/'' Perry/NNP told/VBD reporters/NNS before/IN meeting/VBG Russian/NNP Defense/NNP Minister/NNP Pavel/NNP Grachev/NNP and/CC other/JJ government/NN officials/NNS ./.

In/IN an/DT hour-long/JJ one-on-one/JJ session/NN with/IN Grachev/NNP at/IN the/DT Ministry/NNP of/IN Defense/NNP ,/, Perry/NNP made/VBD the/DT Clinton/NNP administration/NN 's/POS case/NN against/IN the/DT reactor/NN deal/NN ./.

Afterward/RB ,/, Grachev/NNP told/VBD reporters/NNS it/PRP was/VBD not/RB a/DT matter/NN for/IN his/PRP$ ministry/NN to/TO decide/VB ./.

Perry/NNP was/VBD to/TO discuss/VB it/PRP further/RBR in/IN a/DT meeting/NN later/JJ today/NN with/IN Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Viktor/NNP Chernomyrdin/NNP ./.

Perry/NNP was/VBD not/RB scheduled/VBN to/TO see/VB President/NNP Boris/NNP Yeltsin/NNP ./.

Neither/CC the/DT Russians/NNPS nor/CC the/DT Americans/NNPS publicly/RB linked/VBD it/PRP to/TO the/DT Iran/NNP dispute/NN ,/, but/CC Perry/NNP announced/VBD that/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS was/VBD providing/VBG an/DT additional/JJ $/$ 50/CD million/CD in/IN aid/NN for/IN Russia/NNP 's/POS nuclear/JJ disarmament/NN ,/, including/VBG $/$ 20/CD million/CD in/IN equipment/NN and/CC services/NNS to/TO expedite/VB the/DT dismantlement/NN of/IN offensive/JJ nuclear/JJ weapons/NNS that/WDT are/VBP to/TO be/VB eliminated/VBN under/IN the/DT Strategic/NNP Arms/NNP Reduction/NNP Treaty/NNP ./.

Perry/NNP said/VBD Washington/NNP was/VBD providing/VBG an/DT additional/JJ $/$ 10/CD million/CD for/IN a/DT project/NN to/TO re-employ/VB former/JJ Russian/JJ nuclear/JJ weapons/NNS scientists/NNS on/IN civilian/JJ projects/NNS ./.

``/`` The/DT sale/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB big/JJ economic/JJ factor/NN for/IN them/PRP ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` It/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT very/RB hard/JJ decision/NN for/IN them/PRP to/TO make/VB ''/'' to/TO give/VB up/RP the/DT estimated/VBN $/$ 1/CD billion/CD in/IN earnings/NNS ./.

Perry/NNP said/VBD Washington/NNP was/VBD opposed/VBN to/TO the/DT reactor/NN deal/NN even/RB if/IN Russia/NNP worked/VBD out/RP strict/JJ controls/NNS on/IN how/WRB Iran/NNP would/MD manage/VB the/DT reactors/NNS '/POS spent/VBN fuel/NN ,/, some/DT of/IN which/WDT could/MD ,/, with/IN sufficient/JJ technical/JJ knowhow/NN ,/, be/VB used/VBN to/TO make/VB nuclear/JJ weapons/NNS ./.

``/`` Restraints/NNP would/MD not/RB give/VB me/PRP the/DT comfort/NN factor/NN of/IN simply/RB not/RB having/VBG the/DT reactor/NN ''/'' in/IN Iran/NNP 's/POS hands/NNS ,/, Perry/NNP said/VBD ,/, adding/VBG that/IN Iran/NNP has/VBZ no/DT real/JJ need/NN for/IN the/DT reactors/NNS ./.

``/`` The/DT country/NN is/VBZ awash/JJ in/IN oil/NN ,/, ''/'' Perry/NNP said/VBD ,/, and/CC thus/RB can/MD meet/VB its/PRP$ electricity/NN generating/NN requirements/NNS without/IN supplementing/VBG it/PRP with/IN nuclear/JJ power/NN ./.

``/`` So/CC one/PRP starts/VBZ off/RP being/VBG suspicious/JJ of/IN why/WRB they/PRP want/VBP nuclear/JJ reactors/NNS ./. ''/''

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ feeling/NN in/IN Moscow/NNP that/IN Washington/NNP 's/POS objections/NNS are/VBP rooted/VBN in/IN a/DT desire/NN to/TO stop/VB Russia/NNP from/IN regaining/VBG a/DT foothold/NN in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP Eastern/NNP marketplace/NN ./.

That/DT sentiment/NN was/VBD expressed/VBN Sunday/NNP by/IN Russia/NNP 's/POS atomic/JJ energy/NN minister/NN ./.

The/DT Clinton/NNP administration/NN has/VBZ taken/VBN the/DT unusual/JJ step/NN of/IN providing/VBG Russian/JJ officials/NNS with/IN American/JJ intelligence/NN on/IN Iran/NNP in/IN the/DT hope/NN of/IN persuading/VBG them/PRP to/TO drop/VB the/DT sale/NN ,/, The/DT New/NNP York/NNP Times/NNP reported/VBD in/IN today/NN 's/POS editions/NNS ./.

American/JJ officials/NNS said/VBD the/DT written/VBN intelligence/NN report/NN shows/VBZ that/IN Iran/NNP has/VBZ a/DT crash/NN program/NN to/TO build/VB nuclear/JJ weapons/NNS that/WDT would/MD be/VB accelerated/VBN by/IN its/PRP$ deal/NN with/IN Russia/NNP ./.
