Richard Gere Kisses Mystery Masha At Moscow Film Fest Retransmitting to add photo number 
It wasn't just any old kiss.
It was a full-court press by the lips of Richard Gere. In front of
millions of people. On stage. At the televised opening of the 19th
Moscow International Film Festival.
And it put Masha Valentinova on the front page of several major Russian
dailies Wednesday.
Who is the mysterious Masha? And why did she merit the precious public
peck? Everyone wanted to know.
``Some lover?'' asked the irreverent Moskovsky Komsomolets.
Gere, a festival judge, set tongues wagging at Monday's festival
opening when he called out, ``Masha, come here!''
A young woman casually attired in baggy pants and deck shoes appeared
on stage. He kissed her, then turned to the audience. His few words
were translated thusly: ``This is Masha Valentinova. We met in 1988.''
Whispers raced through the concert hall at the festival site, the
Rossiya Hotel on Red Square.
``Who is this Masha?'' Komsomolskaya Pravda demanded. ``And how did
they meet in 1988? And why did Gere shout heart-rendingly to her _ and
then kiss her on the lips? This is the biggest intrigue of the
festival.''
