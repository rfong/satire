Sonia Gandhi visits Indian riot sites as death toll reaches 678
The death toll from India's worst Hindu-Muslim violence in a decade reached
678, police said Friday as Opposition Leader Sonia Gandhi visited the areas
worst hit by the riots.
Gandhi, the Congress party president, led an all-party delegation to
Godhra in the western Indian state of Gujarat, where a mob attack on a
train carrying Hindu activists last week killed 58 people.
The attack triggered communal rioting across the state that left at
least 620 more people dead.
Accompanied by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pramod Mahajan, she was
also due to go to the city of Ahmedabad, which was one of the worst
affected by the violence, and visit hospitals and relief camps.
Meanwhile in New Delhi Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani was expected to
make a statement in parliament as the political fallout from the riots
looked set to intensify.
Opposition parties have called for the resignations of Advani and the
Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, for failing to prevent the
eruption of sectarian violence.
"If you cannot safeguard the lives of the people, I'm sorry to say, Mr.
Home Minister, you have no moral authority to stay in office," senior
Congress party leader Pranab Mukherjee said Thursday during a debate in
the upper house of parliament.
The central and Gujarat state governments have been criticised for not
acting with enough speed or decisiveness to counter the bloody Hindu
backlash following the February 27 train massacre.
The row over the handling of the riots Thursday forced the adjournment
of the lower house of parliament for the day and more uproar was
expected FOm4hy.
There was no fresh violence in Gujarat, but police said the death toll
stood at 620 and was likely to increase because bodies were still being
recovered from different areas of the state.
Police said they had launched a massive operation to arrest those
responsible for the violence, many of whom were caught on camera as
they looted shops and other business establishments.
Police have already arrested 79 people, including 13 women, for
looting. They said microwave ovens, T-shirts, jeans, sofa sets,
suitcases, shoes and crockery were recovered from the looters.
"We have found some of the people had committed thefts at a number of
shops," said B.D. Tandel, a senior police officer from the Naranpura
district of Ahmedabad. "It is regretful that most of them come from
well-to-do families."
Police have also seized closed circuit television tapes from major
shopping malls to identify the rioters.
"Once we identify them (from the tapes) we will launch a search,"
police officer A.C. Jadeja said.
Ahmedabad Police Commissioner P.C. Pande has pledged police will carry
out their investigations without bias.
"Nobody is above the law, and we will punish those responsible for
these events without consideration of which community or organisation
they belong to," Pande said this week.
Police have already filed investigative charges against some members of
India's ruling Hindu-nationalist BJP party, which controls Gujarat
state, as well as members of the militant Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP -
World Hindu Council).
Joint Commissioner of Police M.K. Tandon said police were investigating
allegations that the mobs used voters' list to target Muslims.
The Indian Express newspaper, quoting unidentified police officials,
said voters' lists were used to zero in on their targets.
"The mobs seem to have perfect information about who was living where
and owned what," a police official told the daily.
