Missing Brazilian balloonist padre spotted straddling Pink Floyd flying pig
Missing Brazilian balloonist priest Reverend Adelir Antonio de Carli has
been spotted straddling an errant 200ft giant inflatable rubber pig that
managed to leg it from a Pink Floyd session at the Coachella festival.
Di Carli went AWOL on 20 April after a helium ballon joyride went
belly-up somewhere over the Atlantic.
Despite a massive air and sea search mission he was officially declared
as missing until the LA desert sighting today.
Festival organisers said today the the huge pig belongs to Pink Floyd's
Roger Waters and had been in a spot of trouble on previous occasions.
This weekend it appeared to break loose after a strong gust of wind
emanating from environs the festival's TexMex Chilli-Bean gastro tent
sent it shooting high into the sunset.
About three hours later the iconic swine was seen zooming over San
Francisco Bridge with what appeared to be Rev di Carli aboard.
US Airforce jets have been scrambled and are on the case.
