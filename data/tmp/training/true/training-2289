They/PRP expect/VBP that/IN San/NNP Francisco/NNP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO stay/VB close/NN ./.

The/DT Chargers/NNPS are/VBP saying/VBG they/PRP plan/VBP to/TO win/VB ./.

Oddsmakers/NNS ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, say/VBP the/DT 49ers/NNPS will/MD fleece/VB ,/, flatten/VB ,/, trounce/NN ,/, trample/NN ,/, thrash/NN ,/, bash/NN ,/, blitz/NN ,/, berate/NN ,/, deflate/NN ,/, confuse/JJ ,/, abuse/NN and/CC defuse/VB the/DT Chargers/NNPS ./.

San/NNP Francisco/NNP is/VBZ favored/VBN by/IN 19/CD points/NNS --/: the/DT largest/JJS point/NN spread/VBN in/IN Super/NNP Bowl/NNP history/NN ./.

That/DT means/VBZ a/DT final/JJ score/NN of/IN 26-7/NNP ./.

Or/CC 39-20/RB ./.

Or/CC 50-31/RB ./.

The/DT Chargers/NNPS may/MD be/VB the/DT only/JJ people/NNS in/IN America/NNP who/WP think/VBP they/PRP can/MD win/VB ./.

``/`` According/VBG to/TO the/DT national/JJ news/NN ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP not/RB supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB here/RB ,/, ''/'' San/NNP Diego/NNP linebacker/NN Junior/NNP Seau/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` All/DT it/PRP does/VBZ is/VBZ show/NN you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB respected/JJ ,/, and/CC you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB to/TO the/DT level/NN where/WRB you/PRP should/MD be/VB respected/VBN yet/RB ./.

To/TO get/VB that/DT ,/, you/PRP have/VBP to/TO do/VB something/NN rare/JJ ./.

That/DT 's/VBZ to/TO win/VB the/DT Super/NNP Bowl/NNP ./. ''/''

It/PRP should/MD be/VB noted/VBN that/IN the/DT previous/JJ largest/JJS Super/NNP Bowl/NNP point/NN spread/NN was/VBD 18/CD points/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN that/DT game/NN ,/, the/DT underdogs/NNS won/VBD ./.

Quarterback/NNP Joe/NNP Namath/NNP and/CC the/DT New/NNP York/NNP Jets/NNS pulled/VBD off/RP an/DT upset/NN he/PRP guaranteed/VBD ,/, beating/VBG Baltimore/NNP 16-7/CD in/IN 1969/CD at/IN Miami/NNP ./.

With/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN news/NN ,/, media/NNS questions/NNS keep/VBP coming/VBG back/RP to/TO one/CD subject/NN --/: the/DT unprecedented/JJ point/NN spread/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB it/PRP ,/, ''/'' 49ers/NNPS coach/NN George/NNP Seifert/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` It/PRP demonstrates/VBZ disrespect/NN for/IN San/NNP Diego/NNP ./.

There/EX must/MD be/VB something/NN special/NN about/IN them/PRP ,/, or/CC they/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB here/RB ./. ''/''

``/`` To/TO me/PRP ,/, it/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB an/DT upset/NN if/IN we/PRP come/VBP out/RP and/CC win/VB the/DT game/NN ,/, ''/'' Chargers/NNPS running/VBG back/RP Natrone/NNP Means/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` We/PRP 're/VBP capable/JJ of/IN winning/VBG ./. ''/''

But/CC do/VBP n't/RB bet/VB on/IN it/PRP ./.

All/DT signs/NNS point/VBP in/IN favor/NN of/IN the/DT 49ers/NNPS ./.

They/PRP led/VBD the/DT National/NNP Football/NNP League/NNP in/IN scoring/NN and/CC eliminated/VBD two-time/JJ defending/VBG league/NN champion/VBP Dallas/NNP to/TO reach/VB the/DT Super/NNP Bowl/NNP for/IN the/DT fifth/JJ time/NN since/IN 1982/CD ./.

The/DT Chargers/NNPS ,/, picked/VBN by/IN some/DT to/TO finish/VB last/JJ in/IN the/DT AFC/NNP West/NNP ,/, struggled/VBD after/IN a/DT 6-0/CD start/NN and/CC needed/VBD desperate/JJ rallies/NNS in/IN both/DT playoff/NN games/NNS to/TO earn/VB their/PRP$ first/JJ Super/NNP Bowl/NNP berth/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT 49ers/NNPS have/VBP had/VBN a/DT lot/RB more/JJR success/NN than/IN we/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, ''/'' San/NNP Diego/NNP quarterback/NN Stan/NNP Humphries/NNP said/VBD ./.

``/`` But/CC we/PRP 're/VBP both/DT here/RB now/RB ,/, and/CC it/PRP all/DT comes/VBZ down/RP to/TO Sunday/NNP ./. ''/''

The/DT Chargers/NNPS are/VBP bucking/VBG not/RB only/JJ 49ers/JJ tradition/NN ,/, but/CC National/NNP Football/NNP Conference/NNP tradition/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

The/DT conference/NN has/VBZ won/VBN 10/CD consecutive/JJ Super/NNP Bowls/NNS ./.

At/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ fair/JJ to/TO wonder/VB whether/IN an/DT AFC/NNP team/NN could/MD beat/VB Tampa/NNP Bay/NNP in/IN the/DT Super/NNP Bowl/NNP ./.

Recent/JJ NFC/NN victories/NNS have/VBP been/VBN by/IN such/JJ margins/NNS as/RB 45/CD ,/, 36/CD ,/, 35/CD ,/, 32/CD and/CC 22/CD points/NNS ./.

And/CC none/NN of/IN those/DT teams/NNS was/VBD favored/VBN by/IN 19/CD ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB really/RB a/DT slam/NN on/IN the/DT talent/NN we/PRP have/VBP ,/, ''/'' San/NNP Diego/NNP linebacker/NN David/NNP Griggs/NNP said/VBD with/IN a/DT shrug/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT indication/NN of/IN what/WP the/DT AFC/NN has/VBZ done/VBN the/DT last/JJ 10/CD years/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP the/DT media/NNS is/VBZ looking/VBG at/IN the/DT AFC/NN as/IN a/DT 19-point/JJ underdog/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB looking/VBG at/IN the/DT Chargers/NNPS as/IN 19-point/JJ underdogs/NNS ./.

``/`` We/PRP 're/VBP not/RB saying/VBG it/PRP should/MD be/VB even/RB up/RB ./.

We/PRP 're/VBP underdogs/JJ ./.

But/CC they/PRP ca/MD n't/RB take/VB the/DT 19-point/JJ spread/NN ,/, take/VB the/DT trophy/NN and/CC go/VB home/NN ./.

They/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN to/TO beat/VB us/PRP ./. ''/''
