Dispute Continues Over Montenegro's Presidential Candidacy 
The dispute over who should represent the ruling party in the
presidential election in Yugoslavia's republic of Montenegro has
developed into a veto game between federal and regional authorities.
The election is scheduled for October 5, but the leadership of the
republic's ruling Socialist Democratic Party has been deeply divided
over who should be nominated to represent the party in the election.
While one faction nominated the incumbent President Momir Bulatovic,
the other preferred the current Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic.
As the republic's election law allows only one candidate for one party,
its Constitutional Court ruled on August 14 that Bulatovic's candidacy
be disqualified.
But the federal Constitutional Court overruled the regional court on
August 27, insisting that Bulatovic's candidacy be reinstated. The
federal institution also threatened to determine if the republic's "one
candidate for one party" legal provision is constitutional.
However, the republic's National Assembly ruled this evening that the
ruling of the federal constitutional court has no legal force and the
federal institution has no right to determine whether the republic's
legal provision concerning presidential candidacy is constitutional.
