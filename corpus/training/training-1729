Excise Tax Considered for Pickup Trucks in Thailand 
Buyers of pickup trucks in Thailand may have to pay excise tax as the
country's taxation agencies are under pressure to find new sources of
revenues, local newspapers reported today.
The Excise Department under the Finance Ministry is re-considering the
introduction of a five-percent excise tax on pickups, which it said can
no longer be classified as "cars for the poor" as they are increasingly
used to carry both people and goods.
The exemption from excise tax for pickups is unfair to buyers of
passenger cars which are subject to excise taxes ranging from 32.5 to
45 percent based on their engine capacity, the newspapers quoted
officials of the department as saying.
Pickups in Thailand are now subject only to a seven-percent value-added
tax but exempted from excise tax.
Analysts said that the new policy might be opposed by auto dealers who
are currently suffering a slowdown in sales.
The Banharn government had earlier proposed the introduction of the
excise tax on pickups, but failed to put the policy through because of
a cool response from the related sectors.
