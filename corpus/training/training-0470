Four People Killed in Two Plane Crashes in Canada 
Four people were killed in two plane crashes in Canada Wednesday.
A small plane crashed at 07:30 p.m. (0030 GMT) on a road near Porters
Lake east of Halifax, Nova Scotia, killing two people on board, said
Morris Green, spokesman for the emergency health services in the
Atlantic province of Canada.
The white, two-seater plane "was spiraling a bit, doing funny things,
then it just dropped out of the sky," said one witness.
Authorities have not yet identified the plane and its occupants.
Earlier in the day, a Canadian cargo plane crashed at Houlton Airport
in northern Maine, U.S.A., killing both pilot and co-pilot.
Airwave Transport of Toronto said the tragedy happened while the
twin-engine Gulfstream was attempting an emergency landing.
The plane carrying mail from Halifax crashed and exploded a dozen
kilometers away from Houlton Airport.
