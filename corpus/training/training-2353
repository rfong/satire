French Minister Says Political Unity of Euro Countries Not Solid 
French Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry Laurent Fabius said on
Wednesday that the euro keeps falling because the political unity of
the 11 euro zone countries is not solid enough.
In an interview with the weekly Le Nouvel Observateur published on
Wednesday, Fabius said Europe has a strong economic potential which
should also be reflected in its money.
"We still don't know how to explain it sufficiently, and above all, the
political unity of the 11 euro countries is not solid enough yet," he
said.
He said that during the meeting of finance ministers of the seven most
industrialized nations and the International Monetary Fund last month
in Washington, most attendants agreed that the euro was under-valued by
30 percent in its exchange rate with the U.S. dollar.
The euro fell below 0.90 U.S. dollar on Wednesday, the record low since
its launching in January 1999.
