Lebanon Eases Travel Limits on Palestinian Refugees 
Lebanon has eased the tight travel restrictions imposed on Palestinian
refugees residing in the country.
"The general directory of the General Security decided to consider
Lebanese travel documents granted to Palestinians living in Lebanon as
passports," a government statement issued Tuesday said.
The General Security, however, later issued a clarification, saying
that Palestinians still need clearance to travel, but that the permits
will henceforth be valid for six months and enable their bearer
multiple trips within that period.
The paper said that previously Palestinians needed exit and re-entry
visas for every trip.
The government statement said the decision is the result of talks on
the issue between Lebanese leaders and Farouk Kaddoumi, head of
Palestinian Liberation Organization's Political Department who visited
the country last weekend.
Some 350,000 Palestinians live in 12 refugee camps across Lebanon. They
are denied the right to work in some 75 occupations.
A Palestinian source said further measures, including the lifting of
the working ban on Palestinians in Lebanon, will come out soon.
