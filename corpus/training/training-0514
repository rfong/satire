World Bank Approves Financing for Poverty Project 
The World Bank today approved a 51 million U.S. dollar loan to help
finance the Natural Resources Management and Poverty Alleviation
project in the Sierra region of Peru.
The project will help improve water and natural resource management in
the seven most poverty-stricken districts of the Sierra mountains.
The project is also designed to help adjust land use to soil
characteristics, increase production of fertile lands and convert
marginal and erosion-prone soils into stable soils suitable for
agriculture.
In addition to the World Bank loan, local community labor will
contribute some 28 million dollars to the total project cost of 93
million dollars. The government of Peru will provide 14 million dollars
for the project.
