South Africa Wins Toss, Elects To Bat 
South Africa won the toss and elected to bat when play started
Saturday, opening day of the Centenary Test against New Zealand at Eden
Park.
New Zealand omitted left-handed batsman Mark Greatbatch from its squad
of 12, while the Proteas left out off-spinner Pat Symcox.
The start of play was delayed because of rain and the umpires scheduled
two two-hour sessions.

South Africa: Hansie Cronje (captain), Gary Kirsten, Andrew Hudson,
Rudi Steyn, Daryll Cullinan, Jonty Rhodes, Dave Richardson, Clive
Eksteen, Fanie de Villers, Craig Matthews, Allan Donald.

Martin Crowe, Stephen Fleming, Dipak Patel, Adam Parore, Gavin Larsen,
Dion Nash, Matthew Hart, Danny Morrison.
