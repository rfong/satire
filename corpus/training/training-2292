Germany poised to reclaim lost war territories
In a desperate bid to relaunch her dramatic slide in the opinion polls,
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has indicated that she would be
pressing for the restitution of Germany's lost territories at the end of
the last World War.
This demand would be made at next month's UN meeting in New York.
Mrs. Merkel further suggested that discrete talks have been underway
for some time with Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Russia, Ukraine,
Belarus, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Romania,
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Kosova,
Macedonia, Belgium, France, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Libya, Egypt and
the Channel Islands about possible land exchanges.
German diplomats have confidentially told reporters that they expect
full co-operation from these countries, "...or else..." Further
clarifications of this last sentence could not be obtained from the
German Foreign Office.
It is as yet not clear which borders Germany would be seeking to set,
but the talks held with the different States listed above would seem to
suggest that Mrs. Merkel and her staff have taken the situation in 1943
as a benchmark.
The Japanese government has meanwhile issued a communiqué stating that
they are "watching the situation very carefully."
