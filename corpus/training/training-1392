Ferreira keeps South African hopes alive 
Wayne Ferreira Friday kept alive South Africa's hopes of a place in the
640,000-US-dollar Hopman Cup tennis mixed teams when he defeated
Romania's Adrian Voinea in a men's singles clash.
Ferreira won 7-6 (11/9), 7-6 (7/4) at the Burswood Dome after Romania's
Irina Spirlea beat South Africa'a Amanda Coetzer in the women's
singles. Spirlea won 5-7,6-4,6-1.
South Africa will now look to Ferreira and Coetzer to beat the
Romanians in the mixed doubles.
A doubles win will guarantee the South Africans a place in Saturday's
final against the United States pair, Justin Gimelstob and Chanda
Rubin.
