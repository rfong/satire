China's New Committee for Agriculture 
China today established a consultancy committee composed of noted
agricultural experts, in an effort to more effectively resolve problems
concerning agriculture and the rural economy as a whole.
The committee, whose establishment was supported by the government
ministries and agencies concerned with agriculture, forestry, water
conservancy, meteorology and internal trade, and scientific academies,
consists of 33 leading experts in relevant fields.
The tasks of the committee include offering opinions and suggestions on
the major issues and possible problems in agriculture and rural
economic growth.
The experts are also charged with the duty of putting forward opinions
and views on policy-making concerning scientific development and reform
in the rural areas.
They are expected to air their views on important science and
technology policies, scientific plans and projects, and international
agricultural cooperation, among others.
The experts will also closely follow the latest developments in
agriculture and rural science and technology worldwide, and offer
suggestions as to how China can apply these developments.
The committee's first working meeting, scheduled to open shortly, will
focus on key technology China will need to feed a population of 1.6
billion in the 21st century and on China's policies concerning science
and technology in the countryside.
