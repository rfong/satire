Pentagon Shortens Base-Closing List Due to High Initial Costs 
The Pentagon's list of U.S. military bases to be closed is shorter than
it would have been due to pressure to minimize high up-front costs,
Defense Secretary William Perry said Monday. A senior Republican
lawmaker said the list is too short.
The Clinton administration, making final preparations for issuing the
list on Tuesday, ran into the iron logic of base closings: The savings
come years down the road; in the short term, closing bases costs money.
``It is a heavy price we are paying,'' Perry said during a
question-and-answer session at an American Legion meeting in Washington
on Monday. ``The good news is that by 1999, we will be saving dlrs 4
billion not only that year but every year thereafter as a result of
closures.''
But Rep. John Boehner, the third-ranking member of the Republican
majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, said the administration
apparently is satisfied to keep more military overhead than it needs.
``We still have a tremendous number of bases in our country that are no
longer necessary or needed for national security,'' Boehner said. ``As
painful as it is for the communities in which those bases are located,
we ought to bite the bullet.''
After an initial round of closures in 1988, a base-closure law drafted
by the current House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, led to closure
rounds in 1991, 1993 and this year. The law has no provision for
further rounds. ``We ought to look toward extending it,'' Boehner said.
Perry has said he would like to close more bases in 1997 but thinks
Congress would oppose the idea.
The fiscal 1996 defense budget includes dlrs 4 billion for previously
ordered base closings. Perry said he told the service chiefs to
consider the high cost of closing bases in making new recommendations.
``I told them to put a much greater emphasis on reducing up-front costs
and getting a faster return'' on the investment, Perry said. ``That has
influenced the bases they have selected'' for closure or realignment.
Information filtering out of the Pentagon to federal, state, and local
officials indicates that this year's may be the shortest closure list
yet. Pentagon recommendations must be approved by an independent
Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, then accepted or
rejected in their entirety by Congress and the president.
Under current Pentagon plans, the military will shed 21,000 uniformed
and 30,000 civilian jobs in fiscal 1996, which begins next Oct. 1,
bringing the force to 1.46 million in uniform and 799,000 civilian
positions. Those levels will decline slightly through the end of the
century. Bases approved for closure this year would likely take several
years to finally shut down.
