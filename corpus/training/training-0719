Zmbia To Earn 500,000 Dollars From Molasses 
Zambia is expected to earn 500,000 us dollars from exporting 30,000
tons of molasses to its main markets in Britain and the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) region.
This was revealed by Mukuwe Akamana, area sales manager of the
country's major sugar firm, the Zambia Sugar Company (ZSC) in Ndola,
north of Lusaka, last weekend, according to a report reaching here
today.
''Sales of molasses to the SADC region and the UK have increased
considerably compared to last year when the company earned about
226,000 U.S.Dollars,'' Akamana said.
Sales of molasses had not been encouraging in the last four years due
to the severe drought which affected the sugar cane crop in the
country. However, with an improved production in this year's harvest
season, the ZSC expected to increase export figures of molasses to meet
the rising demand especially among commercial farmers, Akamana said.
ZSC is making arrangements to the expansion of the regional market for
its specials such as jams, squashes, sauces and icing sugars.
