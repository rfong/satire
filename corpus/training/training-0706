US authorizes 10 US news outlets to open bureaus in Cuba 
The United States has authorized 10 news outlets to open offices in
Havana, a senior administration official said Wednesday.
The newly authorized outlets include the Associated Press and Cable
News Network, said the official, who requested anonymity and indicated
an announcement would be made later Wednesday.
The last US resident journalist working in Cuba was expelled by
President Fidel Castro 28 years ago.
Last month CNN, which won Cuba's permission to open a bureau on the
island, complained that the US administration was foot-dragging in
giving its green light to opening a bureau there.
Because of the Helms-Burton law, signed by Clinton last year, CNN had
to obtain a license from the US government before starting operations
in Havana. The new law reinforces the 30-year-old US trade embargo
against Cuba.
US President Bill Clinton reversed a 30-year US ban on Cuban news
bureaus opening in the United States during his first term.
