Japanese Military Aircraft to Use Indian Airport 
Six Japanese C130 Hercules military aircraft transporting relief
material for Afghan refugees would refuel at the international airport
in Calcutta, 1,460 kilometers southeast of here, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported on Friday.
The aircraft would take on fuel at a high security zone of the airport
and take off for New Delhi en route to Islamabad and Quetta in
Pakistan, the agency reported, quoting a high-ranking official in
Calcutta.
The Japanese consulate in the city was tight-lipped about the schedule
of the military planes, the PTI said.
However, local officials confirmed that the transport planes would
refuel at the airport.
The relief materials carried by the planes are destined for Afghan
refugees, who flocked to Quetta under the threat of imminent U.S.
strikes.
It would be for the first time since World War II that foreign military
aircraft would land at the airport in Calcutta, PTI added.
