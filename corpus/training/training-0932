The Nikkei seesawed between positive and negative territory for the
most of the day after opening higher on modest gains last Friday in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, the benchmark was gradually
pushed up higher by buybacks in high-priced tech issues, traders said.
Airlines led the rise, gaining 2.37 percent, followed by automakers,
which faced selling recently.
Telecoms, oil distributors and land transportation firms were soft,
while bank issues were also weak.
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered losers
880 to 485, with 120 issues closing unchanged.
