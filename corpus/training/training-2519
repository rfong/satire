Rockets star suffers irregular heartbeat 
National Basketball Association star center Hakeem Olajuwon has been
hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat, although doctors have said
the situation is not life-threatening.
Olajuwon, a member of the United States Olympic championship "Dream
Team III" in Atlanta, suffered a similar arrhythmia in 1991 and missed
seven games.
Houston's Vernon "Mad Max" Maxwell had the problem in 1993 and so have
several other NBA players.
"You are definitely concerned because something like this can be very
dangerous," Houston forward Kevin Willis said.
The irregular heartbeat, or atrial fibrillation, took place at
half-time of Houstons 122-93 triumph over Minnesota here Tuesday.
Olajuwon had 10 points and five rebounds in the first half.
Olajuwon drank a glass of water and then complained of an odd feeling
in his heart. Team doctors examined him and, when his heart rate did
not returned to normal, rushed him to nearby Methodist Hospital.
Olajuwon underwent several tests and was kept overnight because his
heart rate did not return to normal. He will not be released until it
does.
"I am always concerned about anything that affects one of my players,"
Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. "We have to just see how he reacts
to treatment."
During the previous season, Olajuwon had clotting problems and was
treated with blood thinners. He also wore an elastic sleeve on his leg
to improve circulation. Olajuwon suffered from anemia in 1995.
"They are going to treat it with medication after they complete the
tests," a team spokesman said. "As soon as his heartbeat returns to
normal, he will be back on the floor."
Olajuwon, 33, was the 1994 NBA Most Valuable Player and led the Rockets
to league crowns in 1994 and 1995.
San Antonio forward Monty Williams has an irregular heartbeat and a
defibrillation machine is kept on the sidelines for him. Philadelphia's
Derrick Coleman missed the opening month last season with an irregular
heartbeat.
