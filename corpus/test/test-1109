China to pass new bankruptcy law next year 
China will complete a new bankruptcy law in 1996 to advance reform of
loss-making state firms, but the document will continue to focus on
avoiding closures to reduce "negative effects," Xinhua said Monday.
The Financial and Law Committee of the National People's Congress is
now drafting the new law, which is expected be completed early next
year, the report said.
Among the guidelines of the law will be a requirement to reduce "the
negative effects of bankruptcy to the minimum," by emphasising the role
of mediation and enterprise restructuring, it said.
China's first Bankruptcy Law, passed in the mid-1980s, has been little
used amid official concerns that massive unemployment could cause
social unrest.
Some 25 million workers are estimated to be redundant in the
inefficient state sector, which lost 33.6 billion yuan in 1994. Only
one third of state enterprises are making a profit.
While the new law is to comply with international practice by covering
all kinds of enterprises, it will contain a special section on
state-owned firms to "take the specific conditions of China into
consideration," Xinhua said.
The law also seeks to define the relations between the government,
enterprises and courts in handling bankruptcy cases, stipulating that
official departments may not intervene in the procedures, the report
said.
It will contain specific articles to protect the legitimate rights and
interests of creditors and debtors, as well as those of workers in
bankrupt enterprises, it said.
A separate Xinhua report stressed the serious implications for China's
economy of debts of hundreds of billions of yuan owed by state
enterprises.
"The debt burden has not only greatly weakened the competitive edge of
state-owned enterprises, but also threatened their existence," a State
Administration of State Property official was quoted as saying.
The issue is a "snake in the grass" for the national economy and a
roadblock to overall reform of the sector, the official said, calling
for the problem to be resolved by improving the capital structure of
state firms.
He condemned the practice of dealing with the problem by simply handing
over more cash to keep debt-ridden enterprises afloat, saying this
"hardly provides a solution to the fundamental problem."
