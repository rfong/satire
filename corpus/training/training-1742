Former Lieutenant of Pablo Escobar Released 
Jorge Eduardo Avendano (otherwise known as El Tato), a former
lieutenant of the late Medellin drug cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar
Gaviria, walked out of jail today after serving a four-year and
six-month prison sentence.
Avendano, who first surrendered to Colombian justice authorities in
June 1991 in response to the policy of surrender for drug traffickers,
was one of those who escaped from the "La Catedral" prison in Medellin
together with Escobar in July 1992.
El Tato surrendered a second time on September 15, 1993 and had been
incarcerated in the Itagui maximum security prison since September
1992. Other members of Pablo Escobar's dismantled criminal organization
still remain in the prison.
Several members of the cartel, including the Ochoa brothers Fabio,
Jorge Luis and Juan David regained their freedom last year after
completing their sentences.
