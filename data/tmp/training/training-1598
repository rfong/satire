GRIFF/NNP 'S/POS STATS/NNS STUNTED/VBD ,/, BUT/NNP FAMILY/NNP TIME/NNP IS/VBZ `/`` NICE/JJ '/'' And/CC Fred/NNP McGriff/NNP thought/VBD playing/VBG in/IN 162/CD games/NNS every/DT season/NN was/VBD tough/JJ ./.

``/`` One/CD day/NN we/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG to/TO Chuck/NNP E/NNP Cheese/NNP ,/, then/RB the/DT Discovery/NNP Zone/NNP ,/, then/RB hitting/VBG the/DT ball/NN in/IN the/DT backyard/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT Braves/NNPS first/JJ baseman/NN said/VBD of/IN his/PRP$ baseball-free/JJ days/NNS with/IN 31\/2-year-old/JJ son/NN Eric/NNP ./.

``/`` I/PRP have/VBP to/TO wear/VB him/PRP out/RP just/RB so/IN I/PRP can/MD get/VB out/RP on/IN the/DT golf/NN course/NN ./. ''/''

So/IN McGriff/NNP is/VBZ back/RB at/IN home/NN in/IN Tampa/NNP ,/, palling/VBG around/RP with/IN Eric/NNP and/CC hitting/VBG the/DT little/JJ white/JJ ball/NN ./.

He/PRP even/RB admits/VBZ in/IN a/DT round-about/JJ way/NN that/IN he/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB really/RB miss/VB the/DT game/NN ,/, adding/VBG ,/, ``/`` If/IN I/PRP say/VBP that/DT ,/, people/NNS will/MD get/VB the/DT impression/NN I/PRP really/RB do/VBP n't/RB care/VB ./.

``/`` But/CC what/WP they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB realize/VB is/VBZ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP have/VBP gotten/VBN to/TO spend/VB with/IN my/PRP$ family/NN like/IN this/DT ./.

When/WRB we/PRP were/VBD playing/VBG ,/, I/PRP had/VBD to/TO leave/VB at/IN 3/CD in/IN the/DT afternoon/NN every/DT day/NN and/CC Eric/NNP did/VBD n't/RB understand/VB that/DT ./.

Now/RB I/PRP see/VBP him/PRP when/WRB he/PRP gets/VBZ up/RP and/CC when/WRB he/PRP goes/VBZ down/RP ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ nice/JJ ./. ''/''

And/CC this/DT comes/VBZ from/IN a/DT player/NN on/IN the/DT verge/NN of/IN a/DT career/NN season/NN ,/, with/IN 34/CD home/NN runs/NNS and/CC 94/CD RBIs/NNS through/IN 114/CD games/NNS ./.

McGriff/NNP said/VBD he/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB really/RB think/VB about/IN what/WP could/MD have/VB been/VBN ,/, however/RB ./.

``/`` I/PRP could/MD be/VB selfish/JJ and/CC say/VB ,/, `/`` Let/NNP 's/POS go/VB back/RP out/IN there/RB ,/, '/'' ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` But/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB be/VB selfish/JJ ./.

I/PRP have/VBP to/TO think/VB about/IN the/DT other/JJ people/NNS ,/, the/DT ones/NNS before/IN me/PRP that/WDT sacrificed/VBD ./.

We/PRP 'll/MD start/VB playing/VBG again/RB when/WRB the/DT owners/NNS give/VB up/RP the/DT salary/NN cap/NN ./.

We/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN what/WP the/DT salary/NN cap/NN has/VBZ done/VBN in/IN football/NN ./.

Talk/NN to/TO Stan/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- Kasten/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

The/DT ball/NN is/VBZ in/IN their/PRP$ court/NN ./. ''/''

McGriff/NNP ,/, like/IN many/JJ players/NNS ,/, is/VBZ ready/JJ to/TO wait/VB it/PRP out/RP ,/, even/RB if/IN it/PRP goes/VBZ well/RB into/IN next/JJ season/NN ./.

Does/VBZ he/PRP miss/VB the/DT paycheck/NN ,/, a/DT cool/JJ $/$ 20,718/CD a/DT day/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ added/VBN up/RP to/TO $/$ 393,642/CD ?/.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB one/CD of/IN those/DT things/NNS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` We/PRP had/VBD been/VBN paid/VBN for/IN two-thirds/NNS of/IN the/DT season/NN ./.

We/PRP 'll/MD survive/VB ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO look/VB long-range/JJ ./.

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB anybody/NN is/VBZ hurting/VBG ./. ''/''

McGriff/NNP said/VBD the/DT only/JJ teammate/NN he/PRP has/VBZ talked/VBN to/TO is/VBZ Mark/NNP Lemke/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ his/PRP$ best/JJS friend/NN on/IN the/DT club/NN ./.

And/CC other/JJ than/IN golf/NN and/CC some/DT tossing/NN with/IN Eric/NNP in/IN the/DT backyard/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD he/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN no/DT conditioning/NN work/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP would/MD take/VB me/PRP three/CD or/CC four/CD days/NNS to/TO get/VB back/RP into/IN it/PRP ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Hitting/NNP is/VBZ all/DT mechanical/JJ ,/, so/IN it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB no/DT big/JJ deal/NN ./.

But/CC something/NN is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO happen/VB ,/, something/NN quick/JJ to/TO save/VB it/PRP ./.

September/NNP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT big/JJ ./.

``/`` I/PRP think/VBP everybody/NN wants/VBZ to/TO come/VB back/RB and/CC play/VB ./.

But/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB that/IN I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB enjoyed/VBN the/DT two/CD or/CC so/RB weeks/NNS I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN off/RP ./.

It/PRP sure/RB does/VBZ something/NN for/IN your/PRP$ aches/NNS and/CC pains/NNS ./. ''/''

So/RB does/VBZ Eric/NNP ./.
