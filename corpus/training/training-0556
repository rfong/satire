Peugeot sees European car market growing 0.5 pc this year 
The European market for new cars is likely to grow by 0.5 percent this
year, the president of the private French auto group PSA
Peugeot-Citroen, Jacques Calvet, said here on Tuesday.
Last year the market grew by by 6.6 percent from the figure for 1995
and absorbed 12.8 million cars.
Calvet said that trends would vary strongly in the main European
markets this year. The French market would decline by 10.percent, he
said.
On Monday data from the French auto trade showed that the number of new
cars registered in February had fallen by 24.6 percent after a decline
of 33.6 percent in January.
Calvet said that the Italian market would grow by more than 10.0
percent in response to the launch of a government subsidy for the
purchase of a new car to replace an old car sent for scrapping.
Such a scheme had boosted the French market last year.
The German and British markets would grow by 1.5-3.0 percent, Calvet
said.
