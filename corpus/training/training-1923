Arafat will attend Arab summit in Beirut: Abed Rabbo 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who has been trapped in the West Bank
by an Israeli blockade for more than a month, will attend the Arab
summit in Beirut in March, Palestinian information minister Yasser Abed
Rabbo said Thursday.
"President Arafat will attend the next Arab summit in Beirut," Abed
Rabbo said, without disclosing further details.
"Arafat sincerely wants to participate in the summit, especially
because it will be held in Beirut, the symbol of victory and resistance
against the occupation," Abed Rabbo said.
He was alluding to Lebanon's battle against 22 years of Israeli
intervention and occupation in Lebanon that ended in May 2000, after a
successful guerrilla war conducted led by the Shiite movement
Hezbollah.
Abed Rabbo was speaking to journalists after meeting with Lebanon's
minister for displaced persons, Marwan Hamadeh, at the Palestinian
representative office in Amman.
Hamadeh relayed an invitation to Arafat via Abed Rabbo.
Arafat has been under virtual house arrest in the West Bank city of
Ramallah since Islamic radicals shook Israel at the start of December
with a wave of suicide bombings.
Israel has said he must stay put until he arrests the murderers of
Israel's tourism minister in October.
