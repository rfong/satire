Japan Beats Saudi Arabia in Friendly Tie 
The Japanese footers defeated visiting Saudi Arabia 2-1 in their
friendly tie at the National Stadium here on Tuesday.
The host opened its account in the 27th minute when Hiroshi Nanami
tapped in a rebound from Masahiro Fukuda's shot that hit a Saudi
defender in the box.
Kazuyoshi Miura, Japan's ace striker, also caught Saudi goalie Mohammed
Al-Deayea aghast in the 54th minute with a free kick outside the
penalty box.
Saudi substitute Mishal Al-turki pulled back a consolation goal with
less than a minute before the final whistle.
The win gave Japan a 2-1-1 slate against the Saudis, before their next
encounter on Saturday in Ehime, western Japan.
