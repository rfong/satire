Grachev Tells Lebed to Choose: Army or Politics 
Russia's Defense Minister said Saturday that Gen. Alexander Lebed, a
popular and disgruntled general who has frequently criticized his
bosses in Moscow, should obey orders or quit.
``A willful child may appear in any family. So (Lebed), too, has become
a willful child, regrettably, under the influence of certain political
leaders who are dreaming of eventually coming to power,'' Defense
Minister Pavel Grachev told a news conference in response to a
question.
``He should either continue service in the armed forces or take off his
uniform, retire and continue his political activities,'' Grachev said.
The news conference, which marked the third anniversary of Russia's
armed forces, was devoted to issues facing the military.
Lebed, a 44-year-old Afghan veteran, has commanded Russia's 14th Army
in Moldova. A hero in the army and a supporter-turned-critic of
President Boris Yeltsin, Lebed recently aligned himself with a
nationalist party, a move seen as his entry into politics.
He has criticized moves by Grachev to reorganize the 14th Army, and
told the ITAR-Tass news agency Saturday that the proposed changes
``will behead the command.''
Lebed told the Interfax news agency he is considering resigning as 14th
Army commander, and would decide after Victory Day, Tuesday.
Grachev said he has offered Lebed other jobs, but believes Lebed will
not take them. ``Once a good commander, today he has decided to become,
it appears, a good politician,'' Grachev said.
