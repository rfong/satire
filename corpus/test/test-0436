Martha Stewart down sharply on report trading probe widened 
Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia tumbled Wednesday amid
reports US prosecutors have widened their probe of founder Martha
Stewart beyond insider trading in shares of ImClone Systems.
The Wall Street Journal said the probe may now also include possible
obstruction of justice and making false statements.
At midday, the shares were down 19.3 percent at 10.97, and are down
more than 50 percent from their highest point this year.
Dealers said the report further undermined public confidence in
corporate America, after the news that WorldCom would have to restate
earnings and cash flow after uncovering improper accounting for almost
four billion dollars in expenses.
The Wall Street Journal, citing "a person with knowledge of the case,"
said that the issue for investigators probing aging news about the
company was made public.
The report said Douglas Faneuil, a Merrill Lynch broker who executed
trades for Stewart, reversed his initial account of the transaction.
Faneuil conceded that he initially misled the brokerage firm's lawyers
and the US Securities and Exchange Commission when he backed up an
account by Stewart and her Merrill broker, Peter Bacanovic, that they
had arranged to sell the stock when it reached a certain level,
according to the report.
Faneuil has now told Merrill lawyers that he was unaware of any such
arrangement and that he concocted his initial account after being
pressured by Bacanovic, the report said.
The lifestyle entrepreneur is a family friend of former ImClone chief
executive officer Samuel Waksal, but she has said that she had no
inside information that Erbitux was going to be rejected by the FDA
when she ordered the sale of her stock.
Waksal has posted 10 million dollars bail in New York on criminal
charges that he urged family members to divest their ImClone holdings
just before the FDA issued its negative report on Erbitux, considered
to be a blockbuster cancer treatment.
