WHO/WP Blames/NNP Ebola/NNP Virus/VBD for/IN Deaths/NNP in/IN Zaire/NNP The/DT hospital/NN where/WRB the/DT Ebola/NNP epidemic/NN began/VBD was/VBD eerily/RB deserted/VBN when/WRB health/NN experts/NNS arrived/VBD Thursday/NNP to/TO investigate/VB the/DT outbreak/NN of/IN the/DT virus/NN already/RB blamed/VBN for/IN dozens/NNS of/IN deaths/NNS in/IN central/JJ Zaire/NNP ./.

The/DT patients/NNS and/CC staff/NN apparently/RB fled/VBD the/DT disease-infected/JJ ,/, 350-bed/JJ hospital/NN in/IN Kikwit/NNP ,/, 600/CD kilometers/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 370/CD miles/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- east/JJ of/IN the/DT capital/NN ,/, and/CC aid/NN officials/NNS fear/VBP they/PRP may/MD have/VB spread/VBN the/DT virus/NN ./.

Some/DT ,/, however/RB ,/, may/MD be/VB among/IN the/DT dead/NN ./.

Health/NNP officials/NNS also/RB were/VBD investigating/VBG a/DT possible/JJ second/JJ outbreak/NN of/IN the/DT virus/NN in/IN another/DT hospital/NN about/IN 100/CD kilometers/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 60/CD miles/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- from/IN Kikwit/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ Ebola/NNP epidemic/NN in/IN 16/CD years/NNS ./.

The/DT virus/NN causes/VBZ hemorrhaging/JJ ,/, fevers/NNS and/CC death/NN within/IN days/NNS for/IN up/IN to/TO 80/CD percent/NN of/IN those/DT infected/JJ ./.

Kikwit/NN ,/, a/DT city/NN of/IN 600,000/CD people/NNS ,/, was/VBD put/VBN under/IN quarantine/NN Tuesday/NNP ./.

A/DT team/NN of/IN experts/NNS who/WP arrived/VBD there/RB Thursday/NNP found/VBD its/PRP$ main/JJ hospital/NN deserted/VBN except/IN for/IN 20/CD patients/NNS ,/, the/DT World/NNP Health/NNP Organization/NNP said/VBD in/IN Geneva/NNP ./.

WHO/WP said/VBD 27/CD people/NNS have/VBP died/VBN and/CC 22/CD others/NNS were/VBD hospitalized/VBN ,/, many/JJ of/IN them/PRP in/IN terminal/JJ stages/NNS of/IN illness/NN ./.

Health-care/JJ workers/NNS accounted/VBD for/IN most/JJS of/IN those/DT 49/CD cases/NNS ,/, the/DT agency/NN said/VBD in/IN a/DT phone/NN report/NN from/IN Zaire/NNP ./.

WHO/JJ officials/NNS said/VBD that/IN toll/NN only/RB included/VBD those/DT who/WP were/VBD definitely/RB diagnosed/VBN as/IN having/VBG Ebola/NNP ./.

They/PRP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD likely/JJ to/TO rise/VB as/IN investigations/NNS continued/VBD ./.

``/`` In/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT dispersal/NN of/IN patients/NNS and/CC staff/NN from/IN the/DT hospital/NN ,/, WHO/WP believes/VBZ that/IN more/JJR cases/NNS of/IN Ebola/NNP disease/NN will/MD occur/VB in/IN the/DT vicinity/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT agency/NN said/VBD ./.

It/PRP said/VBD 20/CD more/JJR cases/NNS were/VBD suspected/VBN in/IN the/DT hospital/NN in/IN Mosango/NNP ,/, about/RB 100/CD kilometers/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 60/CD miles/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- outside/IN of/IN Kikwit/NNP ./.

WHO/WP said/VBD cases/NNS also/RB have/VBP been/VBN identified/VBN at/IN another/DT Kikwit/NNP hospital/NN and/CC at/IN a/DT hospital/NN in/IN Yass/NNP Bongo/NNP ,/, about/RB 250/CD kilometers/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- 155/CD miles/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- from/IN Kikwit/NNP ./.

The/DT U.S./NNP Centers/NNPS for/IN Disease/NNP Control/NNP and/CC Prevention/NNP in/IN Atlanta/NNP identified/VBD the/DT virus/NN as/IN Ebola/NNP after/IN testing/VBG blood/NN samples/NNS from/IN victims/NNS in/IN Zaire/NNP ,/, WHO/WP spokesman/NN Philippe/NNP Stroot/NNP said/VBD ./.

The/DT number/NN of/IN deaths/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN difficult/JJ to/TO tally/NN because/RB of/IN conflicting/JJ reports/NNS and/CC the/DT uncertainty/NN that/IN Ebola/NNP was/VBD the/DT cause/NN of/IN all/DT deaths/NNS ./.

The/DT aid/NN group/NN Doctors/NNS Without/IN Borders/NNP reported/VBD Thursday/NNP from/IN Brussels/NNP ,/, Belgium/NNP ,/, that/IN 170/CD people/NNS had/VBD died/VBN since/IN hemorrhagic/JJ fever/NN was/VBD reported/VBN in/IN Kikwit/NNP a/DT month/NN ago/IN ,/, but/CC later/RB backed/VBD down/RP from/IN this/DT figure/NN ./.

Its/PRP$ team/NN was/VBD not/RB expected/VBN in/IN Kikwit/NNP until/IN later/RB Thursday/NNP ./.

The/DT group/NN 's/POS spokeswoman/NN in/IN Kinshasa/NNP said/VBD 20/CD deaths/NNS from/IN Ebola/NNP were/VBD confirmed/VBN as/IN of/IN Tuesday/NNP and/CC 61/CD others/NNS died/VBN from/IN bloody/JJ diarrhea/NN ,/, which/WDT tests/NNS may/MD show/VB to/TO have/VB been/VBN caused/VBN by/IN Ebola/NNP or/CC the/DT bacteria/NNS shigella/NN ./.

The/DT spokeswoman/NN ,/, Veerle/NNP Eygenraam/NNP ,/, said/VBD 20/CD others/NNS ,/, mainly/RB hospital/NN staff/NN ,/, were/VBD quarantined/VBN with/IN suspected/VBN Ebola/NN ./.

Oleko/NNP Taoibashe/NNP ,/, an/DT economics/NN professor/NN at/IN the/DT University/NNP of/IN Kinshasa/NNP ,/, warned/VBD Thursday/NNP that/IN even/RB if/IN the/DT disease/NN does/VBZ n't/RB spread/VB ,/, the/DT quarantine/NN could/MD cause/VB hardships/NNS elsewhere/RB in/IN Zaire/NNP ./.

``/`` Kikwit/NNP is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS important/JJ agricultural/JJ area/NN near/IN Kinshasa/NNP ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

``/`` If/IN trucks/NNS can/MD not/RB leave/VB there/RB ,/, there/EX will/MD be/VB food/NN shortages/NNS ./. ''/''

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT vaccine/NN or/CC treatment/NN for/IN Ebola/NNP ,/, which/WDT Ralph/NNP Henderson/NNP ,/, the/DT assistant/JJ director/NN for/IN WHO/NNP ,/, called/VBD ``/`` one/CD of/IN the/DT deadliest/JJS viruses/NNS we/PRP know/VBP ./. ''/''

However/RB ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` This/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT public/JJ health/NN emergency/NN in/IN the/DT sense/NN of/IN a/DT wild/JJ spread/NN either/CC in/IN Zaire/NNP or/CC internationally/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB serious/JJ outbreak/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN it/PRP concerns/VBZ ./. ''/''

Henderson/NNP and/CC other/JJ WHO/JJ officials/NNS emphasized/VBD that/IN in/IN previous/JJ outbreaks/NNS ,/, the/DT virus/NN has/VBZ run/VBN its/PRP$ course/NN quickly/RB ./.

Like/IN the/DT AIDS/NNP virus/NN ,/, Ebola/NNP is/VBZ spread/VBN through/IN body/NN fluids/NNS and/CC secretions/NNS ,/, not/RB casual/JJ contact/NN ./.

But/CC those/DT infected/VBD with/IN Ebola/NNP become/VBN sick/JJ almost/RB immediately/RB and/CC are/VBP unlikely/JJ to/TO pass/VB it/PRP on/IN before/IN dying/VBG ./.

The/DT doctor/NN who/WP first/RB discovered/VBD Ebola/NNP two/CD decades/NNS ago/RB said/VBD its/PRP$ fatality/NN rate/NN is/VBZ as/RB high/JJ as/IN 80/CD percent/NN ./.

``/`` It/PRP is/VBZ definitely/RB a/DT hemorrhagic/JJ fever/NN ,/, where/WRB victims/NNS bleed/VB to/TO death/NN with/IN blood/NN coming/VBG out/RP of/IN the/DT ears/NNS and/CC eyes/NNS ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT horrible/JJ disease/NN ,/, ''/'' Dr./NNP Peter/NNP Piot/NNP told/VBD The/DT Associated/NNP Press/NNP ./.

WHO/JJ officials/NNS said/VBD two/CD of/IN three/CD previous/JJ confirmed/JJ outbreaks/NNS originated/VBN in/IN hospitals/NNS with/IN very/RB poor/JJ hygiene/NN ./.

A/DT third/JJ was/VBD caused/VBN by/IN African/JJ funeral/JJ rituals/NNS that/WDT involve/VBP cutting/VBG open/RP the/DT corpse/NN ./.

Piot/NNP said/VBD the/DT Zairian/NNP hospital/NN where/WRB he/PRP discovered/VBD Ebola/NNP in/IN 1976/CD had/VBD 120/CD beds/NNS and/CC only/RB three/CD syringes/NNS ./.

That/DT same/JJ year/NN ,/, 274/CD of/IN 300/CD people/NNS died/VBD in/IN an/DT Ebola/NNP outbreak/NN in/IN one/CD Zairian/NNP village/NN ./.

``/`` Once/IN you/PRP institute/VB precautions/NNS ,/, make/VB sure/JJ you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB using/VBG contaminated/JJ needles/NNS ,/, you/PRP can/MD contain/VB the/DT virus/NN ,/, ''/'' CDC/NNP infectious/NNP disease/NN specialist/NN Dr./NNP Ruth/NNP Berkelman/NNP said/VBD in/IN an/DT interview/NN on/IN ABC/NNP television/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT head/NN of/IN WHO/NNP 's/POS Africa/NNP office/NN ,/, Ephraim/NNP Samba/NNP ,/, said/VBD the/DT danger/NN of/IN the/DT virus/NN spreading/VBG could/MD not/RB be/VB ruled/VBN out/RP because/RB of/IN air/NN travel/NN in/IN and/CC out/IN of/IN Kikwit/NNP ./.
