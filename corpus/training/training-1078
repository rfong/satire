2.3 Million Poor Farmers Escape Poverty in Shanxi 
At least 2.3 million poor farmers in north China's Shanxi Province have
shaken off poverty in the past decade, thanks to the implementation of
a nationwide anti-poverty strategy.
The province, located on the Loess Plateau with adverse natural
conditions, had some 4.5 million poor people, mainly in 50 counties of
the Taihang and Luliang mountains, when the poverty relief program
began in the mid-1980s.
Decade-long efforts, together with more than two billion yuan of
funding by the central and local governments, the number has been
reduced to 2.2 million.
Those farmers who now have sufficient food and clothing now enjoy a per
capita income of 950 yuan and 437 kg of grain. And 29 of the poor
counties have basically met the poverty relief targets.
During the period, the province raised over a billion yuan to improve
rural infrastructure. It completed projects to provide drinking water
for a million people, build roads for every township, enable 97 percent
of the villages to have electricity and 45 percent to have telephones.
The province also helped build a large number of rural hospitals and
schools to end the history of cave classrooms.
Every year, the poor areas increase nearly 40,000 ha of basic farmland
and plant some 30,000 ha of economic forests. The nine counties of the
mountainous Luliang area along the Yellow River have grown more than
130,000 ha of jujube trees and produced 200 million kg of dried jujube
last year. As a result, tens of thousands of farmers have got rich.
