China's Trade with Dubai up 
China's trade with Dubai, the commercial hub of the Middle East, has
increased sharply in recent years, according to the director-general of
the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Following a meeting with an economic and trade delegation from Dalian,
a port city in northeastern China, Abdul Rahman G.al Mutaiwee told
reporters Tuesday that the two way trade between Dubai and China soared
to 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1994 from 560 million dollars in 1990,
registering an average yearly growth of 37 percent.
China could improve the market share of its products in Dubai from 5
percent to 7.5 per cent, he said.
Their growing trade cooperation was underscored by China's enhanced
role as the second biggest trading partner of Dubai behind Japan,
Mutaiwee added.
The head of Dubai Chamber urged Chinese companies to make use of the
excellent infrastructure and incentives Dubai offered to entrepreneurs,
to invest more in the city.
