Football Star Simpson Found Not Guilty of Murder 
After a year-long marathon trial, former U.S. football star O.J.
Simpson was acquitted on Tuesday of killing his ex-wife and her
boyfriend.
The verdict, handed in by a 12-member jury after a four-hour
deliberation on Monday, was read in three minutes at a Los Angeles
court in front of Simpson and the family members of the victims.
Simpson, a 48-year-old black star who had spent 473 days in prison
since his arrest last year, became a freeman and can't be retried on
the same charges under California law.
Many thought that the 10 women and two men jurors, nine of them black,
were to deliberate for more than a week after hearing eight months of
testimony from 133 witnesses and were presented with 857 contradictory
pieces of evidence.
Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown and her boyfriend Ronald Goldman were
found stabbed and slashed to death outside her condominium on June 12,
1994.
Following a five-day initial investigation, police charged Simpson with
double murder and arrested him in a nationally televised 60-mile
highway chase after he refused to surrender.
During the trial that obsessed the U.S. media and cost local government
about nine million dollars, prosecutors said DNA test found blood drops
from the crime scene matched that of Simpson, claiming that the black
star killed both Brown and Goldman in a rage after she tried to
estrange herself from him following a breakup.
They also presented evidence of Simpson's abuse of Brown before the
murder.
But defense lawyers hinted that blood samples might be planted or
contaminated. They claimed police and criminalists walked through the
evidence before collecting them.
