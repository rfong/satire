Government Finally Notices Vermont Secession
White House Press Secretary Tony Snow today reported to the press that
the state of Vermont actually seceded from the Union three years ago.
"They sent us a nice note and everything," Mr Snow said at this
morning's press conference. "I guess we were just so busy with Iraq
that we didn't pay attention."
Mr Snow went on to say that allegations that the Bush administration
ignored Vermont's secession because they did not even know that Vermont
was a state were "as ridiculous as anything Bob Woodward could think
up."
A spokesman for recently re-elected Vermont Governor James H. Douglass
confirmed the secession. In October of 2003 while current Democratic
National Committee Chairman Howard Dean was still Governor, the General
Assembly passed Act *69--which absolved all political union between the
State of Vermont and the United States of America.
When asked whether or not the United States would take action against
Vermont, Mr Snow replied: "Probably not. Their note very clearly gave
us one year to negotiate. We missed our chance."
As of this writing, rumors are coming in reporting rioting in major
cities across the country over the hoarding of real maple syrup.
