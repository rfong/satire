SADC Urged to Deal with Y2
Zambia Monday challenged member countries of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to quickly update their computer systems
to avert the impending economic and development catastrophe associated
with the year 2000 (Y2K) millenium bug.
Dismus Kalingeme, Zambian Deputy Minister of Communications and
Transport, urged the SADC members to put in place contingency measures
to avoid the catastrophe in critical areas such as agriculture, public
utilities and transport.
Services such as electricity, telecommunications, petroleum products,
railway and air transport systems are regionally inter-linked, he said
at the third SADC Y2K National Coordinators Meeting opened here Monday
.
The vice-minister called for compliance of all interdependent systems
and management of the likely risks of potential failure with
appropriate contingency measures.
Non-compliance could jeopardize efforts to positively transform the
respective economies and stifle sustainable growth in the sub-region,
said Kalingeme.
He said there is little time remaining to the deadline of December 31,
1999, hence, the need for SADC countries to adopt and use information
and communication technology.
He warned that failure to address the Y2K problem could risk SADC
members being excluded from the information age.
The meeting is being attended by national task force coordinators from
SADC members and other agencies.
