Gulf states set to boost chemical exports to Asia by Nadim Kawash 
Gulf Arab states are set to increase their exports of petrochemicals
and refined products to south Asia as new World Trade Organisation
rules will boost demand, a Gulf official said.
Most of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states have embarked on
multi-billion-dollar projects to expand their petrochemical plants and
refineries and set up new units to take advantage of the growing Asian
consumption, already among the fastest in the world, said Anwar
Abdullah, director of the Oil and Gas department at the Riyadh-based
GCC secretariat.
Writing in the quarterly bulletin of the Organisation of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries, Abdullah said refinery and petrochemical expansion
projects in Japan and other Asian countries were not enough to meet
demand.
"The petrochemical and refining industry in Asia has reached a
bottleneck as a result of a delay in construction of those units and
problems associated with government procedures regarding this
industry," he said.
"A quick solution for such problems is not expected. There is now an
opportunity for the GCC countries to invest in new projects within the
coming 10 or 15 years to secure a big share of the prosperous Asian
market."
Abdullah said GCC states had already become key suppliers of
petrochemicals and refined products to south Asia given their strong
oil partnership.
He cited figures by the giant Saudi Arabian Basic Industries
Corporation showing around 46 percent of its chemical products were
being exported to Asia, which also imported 22 percent of SABIC's
plastic products and 59 percent of its fertilizers. It has also
forecast a further growth in such exports.
"There are great hopes that Gulf petrochemical sales to Asia will
sharply grow because of the new WTO trade rules, which will lead in two
or three years to the lifting of customs barriers in some south Asian
countries," he said.
"The strong and long relationship between the GCC and Asia will also
play a key part in securing a balance between supply and demand in
Asia."
GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) -- produce more than 10 million tonnes of
petrochemicals and their refining capacity is estimated at over two
million barrels per day.
Production levels are set to surge in the next few years as most of
them have announced plans to build new units and expand existing
facilities.
Kuwait and Qatar have said they would set up two new petrochemical
plants while the UAE announced two projects with a production capacity
of nearly one million tonnes per year of ethyelne and polyethylene. The
plants, estimated to cost more than one billion dollars, are the UAE's
first petrochemical projects.
UAE officials said the two projects would target southeast Asian
markets, where demand for petrochemicals and refined products was
growing by an average 5.5 percent annually in the first half of 1990s.
"There are several reasons which make us believe that the proposed
expansions in capacities in Asia will not reach the expected levels
because of the high risks of new refineries and huge costs," Abdullah
said.
"Furthermore, the private sector's role in such countries as China,
India and Indonesia has until recently remained relatively limited.
"We strongly believe that the GCC countries are capable of facing those
challenges and play an important role in meeting the growing Asian
demand for petrochemicals, heating oil, petrol and other products," he
concluded.
