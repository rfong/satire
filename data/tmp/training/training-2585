``/`` This/DT is/VBZ the/DT right/JJ thing/NN to/TO do/VB ./. ''/''

Clinton/NNP took/VBD the/DT action/NN after/IN a/DT sobering/JJ meeting/NN with/IN Republican/JJ and/CC Democratic/JJ leaders/NNS from/IN both/DT houses/NNS of/IN Congress/NNP who/WP bluntly/RB warned/VBD him/PRP that/IN lawmakers/NNS would/MD reject/VB the/DT quick/JJ rescue/NN plan/NN that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN the/DT goal/NN of/IN bipartisan/JJ negotiations/NNS for/IN more/JJR than/IN two/CD weeks/NNS ./.

The/DT president/NN 's/POS spokesman/NN said/VBD Tuesday/NNP 's/POS action/NN won/VBD initial/JJ support/NN from/IN Senate/NNP Majority/NNP Leader/NNP Bob/NNP Dole/NNP ,/, Senate/NNP Minority/NNP Leader/NNP Thomas/NNP Daschle/NNP ,/, House/NNP Speaker/NNP Newt/NNP Gingrich/NNP and/CC House/NNP Minority/NNP Leader/NNP Richard/NNP Gephardt/NNP during/IN the/DT White/NNP House/NNP meeting/NN ./.

The/DT session/NN also/RB included/VBD Secretary/NNP of/IN State/NNP Warren/NNP Christopher/NNP and/CC Treasury/NNP Secretary/NNP Robert/NNP Rubin/NNP ./.

But/CC the/DT urgency/NN of/IN the/DT crisis/NN required/VBD immediate/JJ executive/JJ action/NN ,/, McCurry/NNP said/VBD ./.

Neither/CC the/DT president/NN nor/CC his/PRP$ Cabinet/JJ secretaries/NNS criticized/VBD leaders/NNS of/IN the/DT GOP-controlled/NNP Congress/NNP for/IN failing/VBG to/TO push/VB the/DT measure/NN with/IN their/PRP$ colleagues/NNS ,/, McCurry/NNP emphasized/VBD ./.

McCurry/RB said/VBD Clinton/NNP 's/POS executive/JJ action/NN means/VBZ that/IN the/DT U.S./NNP part/NN of/IN the/DT international/JJ aid/NN package/NN would/MD be/VB about/RB half/PDT the/DT $/$ 40/CD billion/CD target/NN initially/RB set/VBN for/IN the/DT original/JJ U.S./NNP loan-guarantee/JJ package/NN for/IN Mexico/NNP ./.

Action/NNP by/IN other/JJ nations/NNS and/CC international/JJ financial/JJ institutions/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT International/NNP Monetary/NNP Fund/NNP ``/`` has/VBZ lessened/VBN some/DT of/IN the/DT exposure/NN that/WDT would/MD be/VB taken/VBN by/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

Administration/NNP officials/NNS had/VBD argued/VBN that/IN the/DT loan-guarantee/JJ package/NN would/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN a/DT large/JJ risk/NN to/TO American/JJ taxpayers/NNS ./.

U.S./NNP Ambassador/NNP to/TO Mexico/NNP James/NNP Jones/NNP said/VBD Tuesday/NNP that/IN American/JJ taxpayers/NNS face/VBP negligible/JJ financial/JJ exposure/NN from/IN the/DT $/$ 20/CD billion/CD being/VBG drawn/VBN from/IN the/DT U.S./NNP Exchange/NNP Stabilization/NNP Fund/NNP ./.

The/DT Clinton/NNP administration/NN has/VBZ not/RB decided/VBN whether/IN to/TO pledge/VB the/DT $/$ 20/CD billion/CD as/IN a/DT loan/NN guarantee/NN or/CC a/DT line/NN of/IN credit/NN ,/, Jones/NNP said/VBD ./.

The/DT $/$ 17.5/CD billion/CD line/NN of/IN credit/NN from/IN the/DT International/NNP Monetary/NNP Fund/NNP is/VBZ in/IN addition/NN to/TO $/$ 7.8/CD billion/CD that/IN the/DT world/NN lending/VBG agency/NN approved/VBD last/JJ week/NN ./.
