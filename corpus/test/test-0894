Closing Arguments In Case of Teen-Ager Charged In British Tourist
A teen-ager accused of murdering a British tourist last year in North
Florida was lying when he said he was at home sleeping at the time of
the killing, a prosecutor said in closing arguments Thursday.
John ``Billy Joe'' Crumitie, 17, helped plan a robbery that went awry
and left 34-year-old Gary Colley dead at a highway rest stop near
Monticello on Sept. 14, 1993, assistant state attorney Mike Schneider
said.
``His testimony's too good to be true. That's it, too good to be
true,'' Schneider told the 12-member jury. ``What a transparent job.''
The killing of Colley -- one of nine foreign visitors killed in Florida
within a year -- damaged the state's dlrs 31 billion tourism business
and spurred tighter security at highway rest stops and major reforms in
the state's juvenile justice system.
Crumitie's attorney, Dwight Wells, said the state had no physical
evidence linking the youth to the murder. Instead, Wells said
prosecutors relied on three informants, all of whom cut deals with
authorities in exchange for testifying against Crumitie, and an
eyewitness who failed to identify Crumitie until the trial began this
week.
``When it is all put together it does not link John Crumitie to the
incident,'' Wells said.
Crumitie testified Wednesday that he was at home when Colley was killed
and his female companion wounded.
At midday Thursday, the jury, which includes a former classmate of
Crumitie's and one of his former teachers, began deliberations.
Another teen-ager charged in the crime testified Wednesday that he and
his friends decided to get their guns, steal a car and rob someone
because they needed some cash.
But the plan fell apart when Colley tried to get away from the youths
at a rest stop on Interstate 10, said Deron Spear, 18, the driver of
the getaway car.
``The man tried to back up and he ran into our car,'' said Spear, who
testified for the state. ``That's when everybody started firing.''
One of the bullets hit Colley, 34, in the neck, killing him. His
longtime companion, Margaret Jagger, was wounded.
Spear testified against Crumitie as part of a plea bargain. Crumitie is
charged with first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder.
Also Wednesday, another prosecution witness testified that Crumitie
admitted he was involved in the slaying.
``I asked him if he knew anything about it. He laughed and said yes,''
said Thaddeus Crumitie, a distant cousin of the defendant. Thaddeus
Crumitie is serving a four-year prison sentence for an unrelated
robbery.
Thaddeus Crumitie, 19, said he gave his cousin and two other youths a
ride the same night that Colley was slain.
The witness testified that the three youths said they were ``going on a
mission'' to steal a car and rob someone.
Spear, 15-year-old Aundra Akins and another youth also were initially
charged with first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder.
Akins' trial date has not been set.
Spear and his half-brother, 14-year-old Cedrick Green, have pleaded to
lesser charges and are awaiting sentencing.
Green was not present during the robbery attempt, Spear said. Green was
released from custody last year because of a lack of evidence against
him.
Spear, who pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy to commit armed
robbery and accessory after the fact, faces a maximum of 10 years in
prison under the plea bargain.
Jagger, 36, said the couple were on vacation from their home in West
Yorkshire, England, and were driving from New Orleans to St.
Petersburg. They had stopped for a brief nap shortly after 1 a.m. when
the gunmen approached their car.
Crumitie faces a life sentence with a mandatory 25 years without parole
if convicted of the murder charge.
