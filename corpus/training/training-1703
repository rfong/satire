Gestetner changes its mind, agrees to takeover bid by Ricoh 
British office automation supplier Gestetner on Thursday accepted a 179
million pound (286 million dollar) cash takeover bid by Japan's Ricoh,
reversing its earlier rejection of Ricoh's bid plans.
Shareholders in the UK firm, which has sold Ricoh products since 1968,
were offered 89 pence per ordinary share and 92 pence per capital
ordinary share.
Gestetner chairman David Thompson said:" Whilst I am sorry to see
Gestetner lose its independence, the commercial logic for its
acquisition by Ricoh is strong".
Ricoh, which owns 28.8 percent of Gestetner, made its original takeover
move in early July. At that time, it secured an undertaking from
Inchcape, the other major shareholder in Gestetner, to sell its holding
of 15.1 percent of ordinary capital shares.
Ricoh became the majority shareholder in Gestetner in 1991 when it
bought a 24.2 percent stake in the group.
The Japanese company is a major world manufacturer of office automation
equipment, including copiers and facsimiles and also makes photographic
equipment.
The takeover will provide it with direct access to Gestetner's
worldwide distribution network and customer base.
Ricoh President Hiroshi Ramada said that the acquisition reflected a
trend in which manufacturers "are becoming much more involved in
distribution" because of the increasing sophistication of office
automation products which can now be linked directly to computer
networks.
In the last financial year to March, Ricoh made profits of 266 million
pounds on sales of 6.611 billion pounds.
Shares in Gestetner rose by seven pence to 89 pence following the
announcement.
