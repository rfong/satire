SADC Urged for United Fight Against Illegal Drug 
The Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) of Zambia has urged member states
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to unite in drug
fighting.
The absence of an extradition treaty among SADC countries and the
silence on the protocol on combating drug trafficking have made it
difficult to fight the scourge in the region, DEC spokesman Mukutulu
Sinyani said here on Friday.
Sinyani noted that there is no country in the region which has signed
an extradition treaty and this makes it impossible to prosecute drug
traffickers who escape to other countries. He warned that unless SADC
countries make an effort to sign an extradition treaty now, the war
against the scourge will be an exercise in futility.
11 of the 12 SADC member states signed a protocol on combating illicit
drug trafficking in August last year. However, only Zambia and
Mauritius have implemented the treaty, according to Sinyani.
"Unless the protocol is reconciled with laws in member countries and an
extradition treaty is signed, this fight against illegal drug trade and
abuse will be meaningless," Sinyani said.
Cross-border drug-related crimes in the region are on the increase and
drug traffickers are using fraudulent travel documents to enter and
leave countries.
