Bangkok Opens Olympics 2008 Bid Office 
A shower before Tuesday's opening of Bangkok's Olympics 2008 Bid Office
here, was considered by Thai people as a good indication to suggest
that Bangkok was on the right road to achieve success.
This was observed by many local people before the ceremonies began to
bless the opening of the office.
"We have not bid for the Games of the Olympiad before, and many were
surprised why we have been so modest. Now that we have come forward, we
are naturally earnest to win the bid," said Deputy Bangkok Governor
Tirachai Vuthitham before the opening ceremony.
As the Hosts of four Asian Games and five Southeast Asian Games,
Bangkok has also staged many international events. In 1978, sports
leaders in the continent had proposed the Metropolis as permanent
headquarters for the Asian Games, when the continent was fighting hard
to maintain continuity of the quadrennial celebration.
The beats of traditional Thai drum heard, shouts of "chaiyo" ( Thai
word for "long live") rent the air as the President of the National
Olympic Committee Chettha Thanajaro cut the ribbon and declared open
the office.
Chettha said, "The signs as of today are very good and we are convinced
we will pass the first stage and qualify as a bidding city. That's our
next step."
All 10 cities bidding to be hosts: Bangkok, Beijing, Cairo, Havana,
Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, Osaka, Paris, Seville and Toronto must first
graduate from the applicant status, and that depends on the answers
they provide to the 22 questions which the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) have set out.
The deadline for the answers is June 20. Each city must provide 50
bilingual copies in French and English. The IOC executive will examine
the replies June 21-August 27. The results will be announced August 28,
either in Lausanne or Sydney.
At the same time, Miss Thailand added charm and beauty to the Olympic
campaign with her presence. She has already accepted to serve as Public
Relations Ambassador for the bid and will address meetings scheduled to
be held to build momentum for the Games.
Other build-up ceremonies are to be held at the Rajamangala Stadium
here. and free concerts for Bangkok's Olympics bid are to be staged in
Chiang Mai, Khon Kaen, Hat Yai and other provinces.
Australian bid expert, Rod McGeoch who was behind the successful bids
of Sydney and Athens and who saw the potential of Bangkok to host the
Games is expected to make television addresses to the country,
outlining the reasons why the Metropolis should make an excellent host
city.
