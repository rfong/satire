U.S. Regrets to Mexico on Money-Laundering 
U.S. President Bill Clinton has told Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
he regrets the Mexican government was not notified in advance of a U.S.
money-laundering sting, said the White House Tuesday.
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said that Clinton expressed his
regrets last week in a telephone call.
"President Clinton expressed regret that better prior consultation had
not been possible in this case," McCurry said.
Clinton and Zedillo both agreed that "the U.S.-Mexico counterdrug
partnership is vital to success against the shared threat that people
in both Mexico and the United States face," the spokesman added.
Speaking at a separate briefing, State Department spokesman James Rubin
said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called her Mexican
counterpart Rosario Green last week to express the same regrets.
However, Rubin stressed the cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico on
anti-narcotics.
"All I can say is that we value our cooperation with the Mexican
government in the fight against drug traffickers," said Rubin.
The U.S. authorities indicted more than 160, including dozens of
Mexican bankers, in a money-laundering sting operation code-named
Casablanca.
Mexican officials have condemned the operation as an attack on Mexico's
sovereignty, complaining that U.S. agents operated inside Mexico
without their knowledge and in violation of Mexican laws and
international agreements.
