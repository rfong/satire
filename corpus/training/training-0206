Putin warns military strikes against Iraq would be a mistake 
Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Sunday that military strikes
against Iraq would be a mistake, the RIA Novosti news agency said.
"Talk of using force today, when other means exist, is for the least
politically incorrect, and would be a mistake," Putin told reporters
before leaving for Germany.
The US Secretary of State Colin Powell said Sunday his country is "not
yet planning" an operation against Iraq, acknowledging that the
conflict in the Middle East was complicating US options.
"The president does not have on his desk the real and present plan,"
Powell told Fox News Sunday.
The United States, he said, is "not yet planning an operation against
Iraq."
"All options are open," he said.
The US administration has threatened to take military action against
Iraq to try to overthrow President Saddam Hussein's regime unless UN
inspectors are allowed back in to check that Baghdad no longer has
weapons of mass destruction.
The inspectors have been barred from Iraq since pulling out on the eve
of a December 1998 US-British bombing blitz.
