George Bush bites off Vladimir Putin's head at WTO summit
As the news conference concluded between the cheerful leaders of the free
world, a smiling President George W. Bush left his podium and approached
Russian leader Vladimir Putin with extended arms, patted his back, turned
to the assembled dignitaries while leaning toward Putin's ear, and said: "I
know this man's soul!" Then baring his teeth Bush suddenly engulfed and
ripped Vladimir Putin's head off.
Blood spurted out of Putin's neck up to the ceiling and across the
room, splattering horror-stricken journalists and cameramen. Grimacing
in disgust, the President spit Putin's head into the trash can in the
corner and rushed off to his waiting limousine.
Just before his unanticipated attack on Putin, Bush genially assured
the Russian civil libertarian that he has no ulterior motive for
deploying his Star Wars defense shield in the Czech Republic and
Poland, saying that America and Russia should co-operate with each
other in this peaceful enterprise meant to prevent nuclear attack on
the United States from North Korea, Iran and the fruits and nuts on the
San Francisco city council. Bush told Putin that the Russians and
Americans share the same enemy, the French.
Putin, a competitive wrestler in his youth before he was inducted as a
hit man into the KGB, the former Soviet Union's security forces, had no
response. However, his not-yet-named replacement at the Kremlin
recalled Russia's ambassador, Rosie McDonnell, from Washington D.C. in
protest.
After wiping Putin's blood from his face using his jacket's sleeves and
his tie, the President smiled, winked, and apologized for his sudden
outburst and returned to his hotel room to change his clothes. Bush's
prepared statement was read by White House spokesman Tony Snow who
warned the new Kremlin in a short statement prepared by Carl Rove:
"Stop f****ng with us!"
The President boarded Air Force One, turned and waved to the cheering
Russians with Save-the-Whale signs, before the aircraft took off on its
return flight to the United States.
