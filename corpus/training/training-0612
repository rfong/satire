Wheat down, corn mixed and soy up 
Wheat was down, while corn was mixed and soy products rose in heavy
trading Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Soy products and the corn near contract rose due to dry weather in
growing areas, according to Jerry Gidel, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds.
The dry weather should continue over the next few days, he added.
Favorable weather is crucial in this period, which is the most
important to soybean development, Gidel said.
Wheat began the day buoyed by soy prices, but dropped due to weak soy
exports, according to Gidel.
Wheat fell between 4.25 and 7.50 cents, while corn fluctuated between
4.75 cents up to 1.50 cents down.
Soybeans gained between 14.75 cents to 5.00 cents. Soy meal and soy oil
were also up.
