Fire Destroys French Regional TV Relay Station 
A fire destroyed Thursday evening a French regional television relay
station in Loire-Atlantique, western France, depriving tens of
thousands of families of television pictures, reported Agence
France-Presse.
The relay station, located in Louee near Nantes, served
Loire-Atlantique, and a part of Vendee and Maine-et-Loire.
No one was injured in the fire, which was caused by a short circuit of
electricity of a 26,000 volt-transmitter in the station.
