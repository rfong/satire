Russian forces have surrounded the presidential palace in Grozny and
shooting was still going on there late Sunday, Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev said.
The government press service quoted him as saying "shooting continues
around the building" in the capital of the breakaway republic of
Chechnya and that Russian forces had surrounded the building.
The same service had said in an earlier statement that Russian forces
had seized control of the presidential palace. This communique quoted a
joint statement from the defence and interior ministries.
The press service also said Sunday that Chechen President Dzhokhar
Dudayev was holed up in a bunker in the outskirts of Grozny with his
bodyguards. It said he was having trouble making radio contact with his
forces and that they were running low on ammunition.
