Mubarak Warns Israel On Nuclear Debate 
President Hosni Mubarak on Thursday blasted Israel for attacking Egypt
over its anti-nuclear campaign and warned that it could sour relations.
``Are they going to accuse us of an anti-Israeli policy every time we
disagree on something?'' Mubarak asked reporters at a hastily called
news conference at the presidential palace.
Mubarak's criticism came two days after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin told an Israeli parliament committee that a ``foul wind'' was
coming from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry.
Rabin accused Egypt of using the debate over renewal of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty to try to hurt Israeli efforts to expand
relations with Arab and Third World countries.
Egypt has said that it will not back renewal of the treaty when it
comes up for discussion in Geneva, Switzerland, in April unless Israel
signs it.
Israel, the only nation in the Middle East with nuclear weapons, has
said it will not sign the treaty until there is peace in the region.
The two countries have been at peace since 1979, and Egypt has
frequently served as a broker in Arab-Israeli peace efforts.
