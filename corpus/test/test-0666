Government employees march in Bandgladesh demanding pay hike 
A group of Bangladeshi government employees marched through the streets
here Sunday demanding immediate pay increases and threatening unrest.
The crowd of 400 carried banners and shouted anti-government slogans
during the downtown protest march organised by the Bangladesh
Government Employees' Coordination Council, an umbrella organisation of
unions representing one million government employees and officers
nationwide.
The government set up a national pay commmission in October last year
to recommend a new pay scale within six months.
Some newspapers here have reported the commission, expected to submit
its recommendations next month, might be forced to keep the rate of
increase lower than expected and also delay the start date of the pay
rise, in the face of pressure on the government from the World Bank and
donor agencies.
World Bank officials reportedly advised the new government of Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed against fresh public sector wage increases
without first cutting expenditure by privatising loss-making state
enterprises.
Bangladesh spends two percent of its 32 billion dollar gross domestic
product annually on subsidising loss-making public enterprises.
Sheih Hasina's ruling Awami League Party, which returned to power in
June after two decades in the political wilderness, pledged in last
year's election campaign to raise salaries.
