Apparent setback snags US, Japan semiconductor talks
After early signs of progress, the talks between Japan and the United
States over a new access agreement to the lucrative Japanese
semiconductor market apparently stalled Monday.
US chief negotiator Ira Shapiro and Japan's Vice Minister for Trade and
Industry Yoshihiro Sakamoto spent about two hours together Monday
afternoon, in a downtown hotel, and both reported no progress.
Significantly, unlike Sunday evening when the two men met reporters
together to report they thought they were making progress, Sakamoto and
Shapiro left their meeting room at the Hyatt Regency hotel separately
after Monday's session.
With US Acting Trade Representative Charlene Barshefksy and Japanese
Trade and Industry Minister Shunpei Tsukahara en route for Vancouver
for ministerial level discussions, Shapiro said: "We have quite a lot
to report (to the ministers), although much of it is clarifying and
defining differences which remain substantial."
Asked what the next step would be, Shapiro replied: "We are expecting
new ideas from Japan."
Sakamoto told reporters: "I am not in a position to make a comment on
the the progress apart from saying that we have much work to be done on
both sides."
Ironically, there seemed to be some hope of a new push for an agreement
on access to the insurance industry, the subject of talks which ended
without agreement on Saturday.
Shapiro said that one of the first things Barshefsky would do on
arriving in Vancouver would be to have a telephone conversation with
Japanese Finance Minister Waturu Kubo on the insurance issue.
There have been unconfirmed reports that Kubo planned to fly to
Vancouver to meet with Barshefsky on Thursday.
