China to Use Containers For Liquid Cargo 
Containers are to be used to transport liquid cargo on sea, replacing
barrels which are now used in China, according to China Transport News.
The use of cargo containers has been a key factor in the development of
China's sea transport industry in the past decade.
Stolt-Nielson, a major liquid chemicals transport company that controls
one fourth of the world's ocean shipping business of chemicals, plans
to become a major force in China's chemicals shipping market, and to be
engaged in wharf building, coastal energy exploration and marine
aquatic products catching.
The company plans to anchor its ships at Chinese ports before the end
of the year.
After large amount of surveying on the Chinese market, Stolt-Nielson
has decided to set up oil tank washing facilities in Shanghai.
Compared with barrels, containers are more cost saving and
environmentally beneficial.
