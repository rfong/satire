Romanian President Stresses Three Diplomatic Priorities 
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu Thursday outlined the country's
three diplomatic priorities: entry to the EU and NATO, promoting ties
with neighboring countries, and to developing cooperation with Asian
states.
Constantinescu stressed the three were of the same importance and
refuted comments that Romania was giving top priority to West.
Constantinescu said that during his tenure he had pushed for bilateral
relations with all major countries.
Citing his recent visits to some Asian countries, the president
emphasized his significant recognition of relations with those states.
China, Japan and South Korea all expressed their willingness to foster
economic and trade cooperation with Romania, he added.
