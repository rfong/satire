European Union, Tunisia Sign Partnership Accord
The European Union signed a partnership accord with Tunisia Monday, the
first of a series the EU says will form a ``zone of security and
prosperity along the two shores of the Mediterranean Sea.''
The accord is ``the cornerstone of a Euro-Mediterranean area,'' said
Foreign Minister Javier Solana of Spain, who chaired the meeting of EU
foreign ministers.
``Economic development in the Mediterranean is a prerequisite to peace,
stability and security in the region,'' said EU Commissioner Manuel
Marin, co-author of the agreement.
The plan provides for regular political dialogue and free trade in
industrial goods, farm produce and services by the year 2010. In
addition to helping fight poverty and drug trafficking and shoring up
weak democratic institutions, Marin said the accords also should
challenge rising religious extremism and terrorism.
Along with strengthening Europe's political ties to each country, the
EU wants to help foster regional ties between Algeria, Morocco,
Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Palestinian
authorities.
Tunisia's foreign minister, Habib ben Yahia, called the signing ``a
wager on the future.''
``The stakes are high,'' he said. ``The challenge is to succeed at a
model of civil society, economic stability, social stability, peace and
security.''
Tunisia's efforts to build a new, democratic society encompassing
respect for human rights and equal rights for women need the impetus of
economic growth and open markets, Ben Yahia said.
