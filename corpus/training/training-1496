Israeli soldiers evacuated the West Bank town of Bethlehem on Thursday
handing it over to Palestinian control in time for Christmas
celebrations.
Bethlehem, which according to Biblical tradition is the birthplace of
Jesus Christ, is the fifth of six Palestinian towns on the West Bank to
be handed over to the Palestinian Authority under a September deal.
