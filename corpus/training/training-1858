Albanian boat with refugees sinks off Italian coast, no victims 
An Albanian military vessel transporting more than 500 people fleeing
the chaos in their country sank off the Italian coast Monday but its
passengers were rescued by Italian warships, maritime officials said.
The stricken vessel sank off the coast of San Cantaldo de Lecce, near
the southeast town of Otranto. Authorities in Otranto said there were
no victims and the rescue operations were proceeding smoothly thanks to
good weather conditions.
Italian coast guards said they had already recovered 120 passengers
that were to be transferred to an unknown location.
The captain on board the Albanian ship said the excess number of
passengers may have caused the boat to sink.
Italian officials were alerted that the ship was in trouble overnight
after it became stranded about eight nautical miles away from San
Cataldo de Lecce because it had run out of fuel.
A fishing boat with around 150 people on board had been escorted
overnight as far as Otranto by an Italian coast-guards' boat and was
about 12 nautical miles from the coast on Monday morning.
Another fishing boat with 182 people on board arrived in Brindisi
earlier.
The crew were arrested and the town's chief of police, Antonio
Ruggiero, announced that "in future, all Albanian ships and sea-going
craft which arrive in Brindisi with illegal immigrants on board will be
seized."
Between 4,000 and 5,000 Albanian refugees have arrived in Italy over
the last few days to flee the insurrection in their country.
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Sunday appealed to the refugees
to stay at home.
