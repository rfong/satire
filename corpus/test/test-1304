France Ready to Support Egypt's Development
A visiting French official Sunday expressed his country's readiness to
support Egypt's development programs, the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency reported.
After a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, French Minister
of State for Foreign Trade Jacques Dondoux told reporters that France
is ready to finance Egypt's infrastructure projects.
In an effort to attract foreign investments, Egypt has planned to open
infrastructure projects to foreign investors.
Dondoux voiced satisfaction with the growing ties among the medium and
small enterprises of the two countries. He proposed that Egyptian
medium and small companies set up joint ventures with French firms to
market their products in the European Union.
To facilitate the step, France will organize a fair in Egypt next May
for its products, he said.
Besides the bilateral economic ties, Mubarak and Dondoux also touched
on the Egypt-EU relations, the news agency said.
Mubarak expressed dissatisfaction with EU's anti-dumping measures
against Egypt, Dondoux said, adding that this problem no longer exists
between Egypt and France.
Some EU members, including France, proposed early this year to adopt
the measures against Egypt's goods, including textiles and cotton. The
two sides have resolved the issue through talks.
The French official arrived here Saturday night for a three-day visit.
He signed Sunday with Egyptian Minister of State for Planning and
International Cooperation Zafer el-Beshri a financial protocol for
1999, under which France is to provide Egypt with a loan of 260 million
French francs (47 million U.S. dollars) for development projects.
