Moldovan parliament refuses to endorse cabinet reshuffle 
The Moldovan parliament has refused to endorse President Mircea
Snegur's proposed cabinet reshuffle, opening the way for a possible
constitutional crisis.
The move late Tuesday followed a warning by Snegur on television Monday
that he might call for a referendum on no-confidence in the government
if parliament rejected the planned reshuffle.
In a message to parliament, the president blamed the government for the
fall in living standards over the past two years in this
Romanian-speaking former Soviet republic of 4.5 million people.
Premier Andre Sangheli on Tuesday retorted in parliament that the
economic crisis was due to the disapearance of the country's
traditional trade links with the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
Sangheli in turn blamed Snegur for the "rise in social and political
tension" by resigning in June 1995 from the ruling agrarian party to
join the opposition.
Snegur has since then been in constant institutional and political
conflict with his government and the majority in parliament.
