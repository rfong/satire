Hong Kong Companies Susceptible to Fraud: Survey 
About one third of the Hong Kong companies lost money through fraud in
1994, according to a recent survey published by the Federation of Hong
Kong Industries.
The survey found that half of the companies hit by fraud reported the
problem to the authorities, but more than 40 percent of cases were not
reported.
The figures may not mean that standards in Hong Kong were inordinately
low, said George Humble, chairman of the Hong Kong branch of the
Britain-based Institute of Directors.
"There is fraud, there is dishonesty, there is triad activity, but you
show me anywhere except perhaps Switzerland, that isn't like that," he
said.
