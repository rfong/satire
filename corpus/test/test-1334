Over 268,000 New Zealanders Receive Food Grants 
Over a quarter of one million New Zealanders have been given grants to
buy food since December 1994, according to figures released by the
opposition Labor Party today.
Labor social welfare spokeswoman Annette King said that over 268,000
special needs grants for food were approved by the Income Support
Service between December 1994 and November 1995.
"The explosion in the number of grants for food shows the low and
modest income earners are continuing to miss out on any benefit from
the government's much flaunted economy," she said.
She noted the rise in grants coincided with reports of continued
requests for help from food banks.
"In this 11-month period more than one quarter of a million New
Zealanders needed financial assistance to fill the most basic human
need -- hunger. This is a horrifying statistic," she stated.
