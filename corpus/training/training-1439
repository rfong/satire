Canada backs NATO airstrikes against Serb positions 
Canada backed the NATO airstrikes against Serb positions around Bosnia
Wednesday in retaliation to a deadly attack on a market in Sarajevo.
"Attacks on safe areas cannot be tolerated and will not go unanswered,"
said Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet. "These air strikes demonstrate our
resolve to respond to such outrages."
He called Monday's bombing in Sarajevo which left 37 dead "barbaric,"
and urged "all parties to set aside military options and seize this
opportunity to resolve their differences at the negociating table."
Defense Minister David Collenette meanwhile announced that some 1,000
Canadian peacekeepers and personnel are to pull out of Croatia in
coming weeks as planned.
