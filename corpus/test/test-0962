The tough job of Major Marcel Wijsbroek, Dutch UN peacekeeper
Major Marcel Wijsbroek of the Dutch United Nations peacekeeping
contingent in Bosnia pointed to Mount Vis overlooking the camp holding
thousands of refugees from the former Moslem enclave of Srebrenica.
"The Serbs are up there," he said. "They are watching us and any time
they can shell us. With all the people we have here it would be a
disaster."
The mustachioed major, 43, who arrived here on March 4 for his first
six-month tour with the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), has not been
idle recently. Like the other 1,000 members of his battalion he starts
his day around dawn and gets to bed about midnight.
Among his tasks are to care for the mainly Moslem population of this
enclave, one of the now notorious UN-declared "safe areas," protect
humanitarian aid convoys, and for the past week to try to provide for
the thousands who have flooded in from Srebrenica.
The situation was under control Wednesday, Wijsbroek said, but a new
influx of refugees with the reported fall of Zepa, the second "safe
area" in eastern Bosnia after Srebrenica to be seized by the Bosnian
Serbs in eight days.
"More than 6,000 refugees arrived here," he said on the Tuzla airfield
where rows of tents have been pitched to house them. "We weren't
prepared for them and the first two days were tense, but now it's
okay."
But the worry of a Serb bombardment remains. "They can see everything
we do from their observation posts," Wijsbroek said. "Yesterday
(Tuesday) they sent a shell into central Tuzla and two civilians were
killed."
The refugees, however, are more concerned with the fate of their
relatives missing since Srebrenica fell. Some of its Bosnian government
army defenders managed to escape through Serb lines but thousands of
men were detained by the victors and their fate is unknown.
Commenting on the men and women crowding round a young soldier holding
a long list of names, Wijsbroek said, "We have listed all the refugees
in the camp and we are helping people find their families. A father has
just been reunited with two of his four sons, for instance."
Further on more soldiers were setting up a pump after sinking a new
well in the fields, and Wijsbroek said another tent would soon be
erected which the refugees could use as a mosque.
While insisting that the peacekeepers are impartial, refusing to take
sides, Wijsbroek was bitter about the powerlessness of his Dutch
colleagues based in Srebrenica when the Bosnian Serbs attacked the
enclave and took 55 of them prisoner.
"We did what we could and it was a miracle that none of our men was
injured, but of course I feel frustrated," he said. "Our men had to
leave behind their equipment, uniforms and weapons, and the Serbs stole
them all."
Refugees recounted how they had been deceived by Bosnian Serbs who
appeared wearing UN uniforms. "Imagine how they felt when they got here
and found us wearing the same," Wijsbroek said.
The remaining 308 Dutch troops in Srebrenica are holed up in their camp
at Potocari waiting to be evacuated. Asked if they were prisoners,
Wijsbroek said, "Call it what you like, but they are surrounded and
they can not go out."
The major said the Dutch, commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Ton
Karrenmans, would probably be evacuated at the end of this week. "But
we want those inhabitants of Srebrenica who are still on the base to go
with them, and we want to be sure they can take their uniforms and
weapons this time."
Wijsbroek indicated deep suspicion and mistrust of the Bosnian Serbs.
"Yesterday we had the authorisation to evacuate the last 93 patients
from Srebrenica hospital," he said. "But on the way the Serbs took
seven of them, and only 86 arrived in Tuzla."
Wijsbroek expressed fears that any further UN action to defend the
remaining enclaves could lead to Serb reprisals against the Dutch still
in Srebrenica. And he added that when they were released the Dutch
soldiers would require psychological help.
"They are only young, and they have seen some horrible things," he
said.
