Muslim Romany Admits Killing Catholic Bishop in Kotor 
Veton Rizvani (23), a Romany of Muslim religion who was arrested today
by Montenegrin police on suspicion of killing Kotor's Catholic bishop
Ivo Gugic, later admitted the crime.
Rizvani, born in Pec, a town in southern Yugoslavia, worked as a street
sweeper in the Montenegrin Adriatic resort of Kotor, the Montenegrin
Interior Ministry said in a statement.
Rizvani told police investigators that he had killed the bishop for
gain, the statement added.
The retired bishop was found dead in the local bishopric on Monday
evening.
Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic and Minister of Religions
Slobodan Tomovic expressed their condolences to Kotor bishop Ilija
Janjic, the clergy and all Catholics in Montenegro.
"Bishop Gugic was a man who sincerely believed in understanding,
tolerance and love among people not only as a way of life but also as a
way of surmounting all possible conflicts," Bulatovic said in a
telegram of condolences.
"The Catholic church has lost an exalted missionary of virtue and the
people of (the Adriatic bay of) Boka Kotorska have lost a man who
contributed to harmonious relations among people of different religious
affiliations," Tomovic said.
