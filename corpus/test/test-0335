Budget Deficit Down Remarkably in Czech Republic 
The Czech government's budget deficit went down remarkably in July,
making it the best month for the state finance so far this year.
Latest National Statistics Bureau figures carried by the press here
today showed an accumulative deficit of 8.8 billion koruny (270 million
U.S. dollars) by the end of July.
Compared with the total deficit of 14.8 billion koruny (450 million
dollars) at the end of June, the July figure represented a drop of 6.0
billion koruny (180 million dollars).
The improved finance was the result of government revenues of 287.6
billion koruny (8.71 billion dollars) and expenditures of 296.4 billion
koruny (8.98 billion dollars) in July.
The budget deficit of the Czech Republic emerged at the beginning of
this year as the country began to see a slowdown in economic growth and
recording a deficit in foreign trade.
As over one third of the country's enterprises reported losses and its
currency was depreciated, the economy dipped into real hardship and the
deficit climbed to the all-time high in June.
To stop the downward slide, the Czech government rushed in April and
May to introduce the two series of austerity measures that so far have
cut its budgetary spendings by 7.56 percent.
The measures now in practice include downsizing government
institutions, postponing the construction of office buildings and other
facilities, and canceling regular state banquets.
