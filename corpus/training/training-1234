Agen win European club tournament 
French club Agen became the first winners of the four-team
International Challenge Cup rugby tournament when they beat hosts
Leicester 28-22 in the final on Monday.
The French visitors turned in a superb all-round performance, which
included three tries, and the final scoreline failed to reflect their
overall superiority.
