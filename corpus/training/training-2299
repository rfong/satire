Former CTP MPs Join Chavalit in Thailand 
A key member of Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party (CTP) Tuesday led some
20 former CTP members of parliament (MPs) to join the New Aspiration
Party (NAP) led by Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the Bangkok Post reported
today.
Sanoh Thienthong, former CTP secretary-general, said he had no choice
but to leave the CTP after being treated unfairly by party leader
Banharn Silpa-archa.
Sanoh said he was leaving with regret as the CTP had changed so much
and he could not stay.
After weighing a number of factors, Sanoh said that the NAP was his
only choice.
Sanoh will serve as secretary-general of the NAP, which had 57 seats in
the Lower House that was dissolved by Banharn last weekend, to replace
Sukavich Rangsitpol who will become the advisory chairman of the party.
Meanwhile, according to the newspaper, 16 former MPs from the Nam Thai
(Thai Leadership) Party (NTP) led by Amnuay Virawan were also admitted
into the NAP Tuesday.
However, Amnuay and another NTP former MP, the newspaper said, are
expected to join the Democratic Party.
NAP leader Chavalit's prospect for the election was significantly
enhanced with the recruitment of these potential MPs.
