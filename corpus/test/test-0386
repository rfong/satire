UN chief's battle to stay fuels Franco-US row by Rene Slama 
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is set to meet French
President Jacques Chirac Wednesday, just as tensions are mounting
between Washington and Paris over the fate of the world body chief and
other matters.
The United States opposes Boutros-Ghali's bid for reelection to a
second five-year term, while France has tried to rally support for the
embattled UN chief, whose term expires December 31.
Adding fuel to the Franco-American tension is the just concluded trip
to Africa by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
There is also the recent butting of heads over the situation in Iraq
and the NATO command structure in Europe, notably Washington's refusal
to allow a European head of the southern command of the North Atlantic
Treaty Alliance.
"Things are not going very well right now" between France and
Washington, said one UN diplomat, who requested anonymity.
As for the Africa trip, French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain
suggested Christopher was using the occasion to generate support among
US blacks ahead of the presidential elections, remarks that a State
Department spokesman called "scandalous."
Christopher, who began his African journey October 7 in Mali, invited
the African countries to present serious candidates to replace
Boutros-Ghali, a 73-year-old Egyptian.
While France was at first ambiguous on whether it supported
Boutros-Ghali, Foreign Minister Herve de Charette recently made it
clear that his country backed the UN chief.
According to sources at the United Nations, Christopher reportedly said
at the beginning of the African tour: "We are going to show the French
that the Americans also have clout."
Boutros-Ghali's trip to France, meanwhile, will feature discussions
between the UN chief and Chirac on a variety of subjects, including the
difficulty of carrying out the "oil-for-food" deal with Iraq and the
fragile situation in Burundi, sources say.
But those same sources are mum on the issue everybody is talking about
-- Boutros-Ghali's re-election bid, and Washington's determination to
block it.
Last week, Godfrain, the cooperation minister, told TV5 (French): "The
right of veto does not only belong to the Americans, France also has
the right."
