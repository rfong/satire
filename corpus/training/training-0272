London Stocks Hit New Peak for 1995 
The London Stock Exchange reached a new peak for 1995 this week, buoyed
by takeover speculations and easing interest-rate fears.
The Financial Times share price index of 100 leading British companies
closed 50.2 points higher over the week at 3,109.9, a healthy rise of
1.6 percent.
Big gainers were Trafalgar House PLC and Northern Electric PLC, the
privatized power generator in Newcastle, northeast England. Two weeks
ago Trafalgar -- the London-based consortium with interests in
construction, engineering, property, cruise liners and hotels --
launched a hostile 1.2 billion-pound (dlrs 1.85 billion) takeover bid
for Northern.
Northern immediately sought to have the proposed buyout referred to the
Merger and Monopolies Commission, but most traders decided this week
that's unlikely to pose an obstacle.
More broadly, the market rose following last week's half-point base
rate rise in Britain, which followed by a day the same
anti-inflationary action in the United States. Investors increasingly
believe that interest rates have reached the high end, leaving the way
open for more bullish times in London.
