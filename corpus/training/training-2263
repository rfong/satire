Japanese Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said Friday the current dollar's

orderly reversal," which was agreed at the Washington meeting of the
Group of Seven major economies last April, he told reporters after a
cabinet meeting.
The dollar changed hands at 104.95-98 yen in mid-morning trading
Friday, compared with 105.03 yen in New York late Wednesday and 105.22
