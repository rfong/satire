Canadian auto workers win round one of contract talks: Chrysler signs 
Canada's unionized auto workers have won round one in their contract
talks with the Big Three automakers, but tougher battles lay ahead.
With just one hour to go before a strike deadline, the Canadian Auto
Workers (CAW) union signed an agreement late Tuesday night with
Chrysler, the first of the Big Three to hold contract talks.
And Chrysler gave the union what it wanted: security from escalating
contracting-out practices under which automakers hire the services of
cheaper, usually non-union sub-contractors to produce parts less
expensively.
But CAW president Buzz Hargrove admitted that the next rounds of talks,
with Ford and General Motors, could be tougher -- especially the talks
with GM.
Just hours after warning a strike against Chrysler was likely, a
jubilant Hargrove told journalists: "Who said you can't move mountains?
There's no concessions in this agreement."
Chrysler's 13,000 union workers are expected to ratify the agreement on
Sunday.
Chrysler spokesman Othmar Stein admitted the fear of a strike forced
Chrysler to agree to terms it would have preferred to have rejected.
"For us," he said, "the cost of a strike is prohibitive."
Among the main items of the three-year agreement:
- Chrysler agrees to replace any job it contracts out with a similar
job at one of its own plants;
- a two percent per year pay increase;
- an extra 10 days paid time off for all workers over the three-year
term of the contract;
- No plant closures by Chrysler during the term of the contract.
