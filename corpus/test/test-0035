S. Africa Politely Refuses Rafsanjani's State Visit 
South Africa today politely refused the state visit by Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to Pretoria in a bid not to offend
Americans.
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said at a press conference
here that two days before he left for Iran, President Nelson Mandela
told him that he would welcome an unofficial visit by Iran's President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani "if he was passing by in the area."
Earlier reports here had indicated that a state visit by Rafsanjani to
South Africa was scheduled for March or April this year.
Nzo said that it was not the question of "the desire" to extend an
official invitation.
"We want to pay a very special attention to the visit by the Iranian
president to our country," he said.
But he noted that was not "a state visit."
Nevertheless, the South African minister said, the problems between
Iran and the United States will not affect relations between Tehran and
Pretoria.
Nzo stated that his country pursues an independent foreign policy.
Nzo, who arrived here today, is on a second visit to Tehran. His first
visit was in November 1994. During his current three-day visit, he
would inaugurate the South African Embassy.
Iran reestablished ties with South Africa after Pretoria abolished the
apartheid system. Relations between Tehran and Pretoria have remained
friendly despite U.S. pressure on Mandela to limit or sever ties with
Iran.
