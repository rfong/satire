Murdered crime reporter buried as PM vows action 
President Mary Robinson joined thousands of people Saturday at the
funeral of an investigative journalist gunned down apparently on the
orders of underworld drugs barons.
More than 3,000 people turned out in a suburb of the Irish capital for
the service for Veronica Guerin, 36, who was shot dead Wednesday by two
men on a motorcycle.
Prime Minister John Bruton, who was also among the mourners, earlier
pledged to clamp down on organised crime with referendums to tighten up
bail conditions and restrict a suspect's right to silence.
He said nationwide referendums on those measures could be held by the
end of the year.
Bruton is due to meet again Monday with Dick Spring and Proinsias de
Rossa, the two junior partners in the government coalition, to discuss
other measures to tackle organised crime.
Czech President Vaclav Havel, who is on a visit to Ireland, signed a
book of condolences.
A minute's silence will be observed throughout the country Monday in
honour of Guerin, who worked for Dublin's Sunday Independent. She had
been the target of two previous attacks, in 1994 and 1995, following
articles which identified Irish organized crime kingpins.
Her killing has rocked the country and highlighted the very savagery of
the underworld she was trying to write about.
According to police, her murder was ordered by a major Dublin drugs
baron in his 40s who was known to them, but against whom nothing has
been proved. Guerin was apparently investigating money laundering
involving his drugs network.
The Irish Independent Newspapers group has offered a reward of 100,000
Irish pounds (150,000 dollars) for information leading to the arrest of
her killers.
Bruton has convened a special one-day session of the Irish parliament
for July 25 to consider new measures against organised crime.
