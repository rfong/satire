ANC and IFP leaders pushing for political merger
Leaders of South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the
Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in the troubled KwaZulu-Natal
province are backing a merger between the arch-rival parties,
Johannesburg's Sunday Times newspaper said.
A merger, which "could be the most significant political realignment in
South Africa in decades" is supported by KwaZulu-Natal ANC leader Jacob
Zuma and the IFP's provincial public works minister Celani Mtetwa, the
newspaper said.
Nearly 20,000 people have died -- including 300 since February -- in 11
years of fighting betweeen ANC and IFP supporters in KwaZulu-Natal.
