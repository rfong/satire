French Open Champions Toppled in Monte Carlo Open 
French Open former and reigning champions both crushed out of the Monte
Carlo Open men's tennis tournament in the third round on Thursday.
Reigning champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil was beaten 7-6 (8-6), 6-1
by Frenchman Cedric Pioline, while former French Open title holder
Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov suffered his defeat against Carlo Moya of
Spain 6-2, 6-3.
The defeats were hardly surprising as neither the eight-seeded
Brazilian nor the fourth-seeded Russian ever did well in Monte Carlo
while Pioline reached the final in 1993 and Moya the semifinals last
year.
"I don't feel any pressure with the French Open only a month away. I'm
improving with each week and remember that last year I lost in the
first round here," Kuerten said.
The Brazilian showed glimpses of the form which helped him to win at
Roland Garros last year. In the first set with five breaks, Kuerten
even had a 5-3 lead in the tiebreak before losing 6-8.
"I could have taken the first set and it would have been very
different," said Kuerten.
