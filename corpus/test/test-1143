China Encourages Treatment of Leprosy With Bonus 
Many local governments in China are taking new steps to improve the
prevention and treatment of leprosy, and some are awarding cash to
people who report cases of the disease to authorities.
In some economically-developed areas, up to 500 yuan can be given for
turning in the names of people who suffer from the chronic condition --
a bacterial disease of the skin and nerves which causes severe
deformities.
According to official reports, the number of cases is now estimated at
7,000, and that of newly-discovered cases has gone down from nearly
5,000 in 1985 to some 2,000 in 1995.
Leprosy used to be rampant in Guangdong, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces
in southern China, where great financial and human resources have been
focused on treating the disease. Today, the disease has been nearly
wiped out in these areas.
Leprosy dates back more than 5,000 years, and has been in existence in
China for at least 2,000 years.
In 1957, the official estimate of the leper population in China was put
at between 380,000 and 390,000. Those afflicted were concentrated
mainly in the southeast coastal areas and the Yangtze River area, and
scattered throughout the northeast, north and northwest parts of China.
According to He Daxun, secretary general of China Leprosy Association,
China's strategy is to discover the patients as early as possible and
treat them with chemotherapy as recommended by the World Health
Organization (WHO).
According to the WHO standard, a country is considered to have
basically wiped out leprosy if the incidence rate drops below 0.1 per
1,000. China reached the goal in 1981.
Several nationwide surveys of contagious diseases were carried out in
the 1970s. Nearly all the lepers in China were discovered and
registered by 1981, and 250,000 lepers were cured.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Public Health, the
number of lepers needing treatment was reduced to less than 120,000 at
the end of 1981.
To completely eradicate leprosy, the Chinese Government set its own
goal in November of 1981, vowing to reduce the incidence rate in every
county or city to less than 0.01 per 1,000 at the end of the century.
At present, 83.4 percent of the counties have reached the target.
He Daxun started research on leprosy in the 1960s, and treated lepers
in Tibet from 1970 to 1977.
"Health education is crucial to the prevention and treatment of
leprosy," he said. "It is crucial that the lepers be discovered and
treated before they become severely handicapped."
If treated at the initial stage, more than 90 percent of the leprosy
bacteria can be killed, he said. But to return cured patients to
society is a tremendously painful task.
China stopped isolating lepers by placing them in separate rooms in
1986. Patients now are asked to receive treatment at home.
On the last Sunday of January every year, which is both the World
Leprosy Day and China's Leprosy Day, various activities are held to
spread knowledge about leprosy, and officials visit lepers.
The 15th International Leprosy Conference will be held in Beijing in
1998. China will announce to the world at the conference that it has
basically exterminated leprosy, He disclosed.
