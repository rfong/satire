Kohl To Start Three-Nation Asia Tour 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will visit Asia from November 12 to 22,
the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) reported today, quoting a reliable
government source.
Kohl will first visit Beijing, where he will meet Chinese leaders,
before proceeding to Vietnam and Singapore.
During the tour, Kohl will not go to Malaysia as originally planned
since the visit to that country has been postponed indefinitely.
