Gansu Farmers Improving Desert Farmland 
Farmers in northwest China's Gansu Province have been busy with
improving large tracts of desert farmland.
Major slices of farmland were lost because of a local custom of
protecting land in winter with a cover of sand.
However, because the region lies on the southern fringee of the Tengger
Desert, the desertification of farmland was serious, said a local
agricultural official.
A large water conservancy project was finished last October, with the
cooperation of experts from China, Japan, Italy, Australia and the
United States.
It takes water from the Datong River, which lines the border of Gansu
and Qinghai provinces, to the Qinwangchuan Prefecture, 60 km north of
Lanzhou City, the provincial capital.
The official said that the project will help local farmers in the
prefecture to reclaim 57,000 hectares of desert.
About 280,000 farmers in Yongdeng and Gaolan counties have raised
nearly 20 million yuan. The money will be used to remove a sand dune as
thick as 30 cm from their land, said the official.
Moreover, local government has bought 130 bulldozers to help the
farmers, he added.
The farmers have already reclaimed 21,600 ha of desert, the official
added. The acreage of the region's irrigated area has increased by
19,000 ha.
He noted that the farmers have also repaired and upgraded more than
2,000 km of roads and planted trees to form a 400 km-long shelterbelt.
The local government plans to move 80,000 people from poverty-stricken
areas to the region. So far, 11,000 people have already resettled, the
official added.
