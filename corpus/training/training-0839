Court hearing in Manhattan on Daiwa affair 
The US federal court handling the Daiwa affair unexpectedly announced
it was holding a hearing here Wednesday afternoon.
Court officials declined the give details of the hearing but said
Manhattan prosecutor Mary Jo White would hold a news conference later
in the day.
The announcement triggered rumors the Japanese bank, which is accused
of fraud and concealing losses from regulators, may agree to a plea
bargain.
The trial was scheduled for April 15.
Daiwa Bank was charged last November with 24 counts of fraud,
obstruction and falsification of documents. If found guilty, it could
face a fine of 1.3 billion dollars.
Last month, Daiwa agreed to sell its US operations to the Sumimoto bank
after being ordered by the Federal Reserve to cease all operations in
the United States.
Daiwa said it would plead not guilty.
The former vice president of Daiwa's New York branch, Toshihide Iguchi,
is charged separately with masterminding the fraud.
