General Motors Reports Better-Than-Expected Profits, Revenue 
General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, posted
first-quarter results Thursday that easily beat earnings estimates,
according to reports from the company.
The company reported a net income of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars, or 2.80
dollars a share, in the quarter. Analysts surveyed by earnings tracker
First Call had forecast the company would earn 2. 66 dollars per share
in the quarter. A year earlier, GM reported then-record earnings of 1.8
billion dollars, or 2.68 dollars a diluted share.
Revenue rose 10 percent to 46.9 billion dollars in the latest quarter
from 42.4 billion dollars a year earlier. Revenue from vehicle sales
rose to 40.4 billion dollars from 36.6 million dollars, while its
financing operations saw revenue rise to 4.1 billion dollars from 3.5
billion dollars.
GM reported that 11 of 13 vehicle categories had sales gains in the
quarter, and overall North American vehicle sales rose 11 percent.
Sales in the profitable truck segment rose 20 percent to a company
record, and company officials said the mix of vehicles sold improved to
more profitable models.
Despite those gains, industry analysts believe that the pricing
pressure meant North American operating profit slipped to 1.3 billion
dollars from a record 1.4 billion dollars a year earlier. But the
company posted improved operating results everywhere else around the
globe.
"Record market demand in North America and Europe was accompanied by
unrelenting competitive pressures, while economic conditions continued
to affect markets in the Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions,"
Chairman and CEO Jack Smith said.
"We're particularly pleased that GM Europe improved its profitability
during the period, and that both GM Latin America/ Africa/Middle East
and GM Asia Pacific were profitable, a significant improvement over the
first quarter last year." Smith added.
