Platt joins Arsenal 
England captain David Platt announced on Monday he was leaving Italian
giants Sampdoria for Arsenal in a 4.75 million pound move, according to
the BBC.
The 29-year-old midfielder, who began his Italian career in 1991 with a
5.5 million pound deal from Aston Villa to Bari, becomes the second
big-money signing by the North London club in the last month after the
arrival of star Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp from Inter Milan.
