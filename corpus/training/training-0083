Damon Hill drove his Williams-Renault to victory in Sunday's Grand Prix
of San Marino, beating Ferrari drivers Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger at
the Imola track.
The 11th career victory in the third event of the 1995 World F-1
championship -- and Hill's second straight this season after Argentina
-- vaulted the 34-year-old Briton atop the world drivers standings,
with 20 points.
World champion Michael Schumacher, who started the race in pole
position and as championship leader with 14 points, spun off in the
10th lap and crashed against the protective barrier at the Piratella
turn.
Schumacher's Benetton-Renault was badly damaged, losing the right front
and rear wheels but the German driver escaped the accident with a minor
cervical muscle sprain.
Hill beat runner-up Alesi by 18.5 seconds in a replay of the Argentine
GP finish.
Berger came third, 43.1 seconds behind.
Hill's teammate David Coulthard, delayed by a penalty pit stop,
finished fourth, with a gap of 51.8 seconds.
In the world drivers championship Alesi tied Schumacher at 14 points,
six behind Hill.
Berger and Coulthard were tied at nine points.
Hill's triumph at Imola was emotional for Williams-Renault at the
circuit where Ayrton Senna, the team No. 1 driver, suffered a fatal
crash last year.
Drivers paid a one-minute silence tribute to the memory of Senna before
starting in the race.
Only the top four drivers completed 63 laps or a total distance of
308.38 kilometers (191.62 miles).
Finland's Mika Hakkinen, in a McLaren-Mercedes, was the first of the
lapped drivers in fifth place.
Austrian Heinz Harald Frentzen placed sixth in a Sauber-Ford, one lap
behind the winner.
