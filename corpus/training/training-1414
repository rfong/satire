Sex in Space - Astro-Tourist Returns After Zero-G Shagging!
Billionaire space tourist Chuck Simon and two crew from the
Pan-International Space Station (PISS) have safely returned to Earth.
A reporter for TheSpoof.com was on hand in Kazakhstan to witness their
arrival and to get a few words with the intrepid multi-squillionair,
poon hound and all round lucky fcuker.
He told our reporter "the in-flight service was great although I was a
bit cheesed off that the attendants didn't wear mini skirts, that would
have been cool in zero-G. But I did managed to get my end away, which
always good when you have a weekend mini-break"
He informed our stunned reporter that they are all doing it up there,
"as soon as a newbie arrives, it's kit off and down to business"
Floating felatio!
Zero gravity gratification!
Aerial adult acrobatics!
Apparently, According to Mr Simon, this has been going on as long as
man (and woman) has been in space. He said, "I was told by one
astro-naughty lady, that Michael Collins, who stayed in the command
module on the first moon landing, started it all by having a quick one
off the wrist while Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong skipped across the
lunar surface"
Michael Collins will go down in NASAs history books as making a giant
leap for hand kind.
We asked the free-floating fornicator how it was for him, " it's was
great being a space punter and getting involved with the zero-G shag
fest, but I am so knackered! The only problem with doing it in space
is, I was up all night!
