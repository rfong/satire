Harare Residents Protest Against Price Hikes 
Hundreds of Harare's Mabvuku residents today staged an incident-free
protest against the recent price hikes on almost all basic commodities.
Basic commodities, including mealie-meal, cooking oil and bread were
last week hiked by an average of 20 percent.
The demonstrators called on President Robert Mugabe to intervene and
reintroduce subsidies on essential goods.
Producers attributed the price hike to the 17.5 percent rise in sales
tax from the 15 percent toward the end of last year and the devaluation
of the Zimbabwean Dollar which has constantly lost to major currencies
over the past few months.
The demonstrators said they expected the rest of the country to join
and trigger a national consumer boycott.
"We are appealing to President Mugabe to intervene and save us from
continued suffering. We are the ones who put that government in power
and hence it should be seen to protect our interests," a resident said.
"What hurts us most is that these hikes are unnecessary as most of the
raw materials used in the production of these things are found locally
in Zimbabwe. This is too much and we are saying we can not take this
any longer," the resident said.
Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications Chen
Chimutengwende last week said the government was aware that some whites
were bitter about the land redistribution exercise and were trying to
use every possible means to discredit the government.
He warned that the government could soon impose price controls on basic
commodities to curb the price hikes.
