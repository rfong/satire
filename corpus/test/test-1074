Nicaraguan police, army fan out to guard airport amid student unrest 
Nicaraguan army troops and police were ordered into action Wednesday to
guard Managua's international airport amid fears that increasingly
disruptive student protestors could occupy it, officials said.
"We have stepped up monitoring with our own personnel, with police and
military troops, since we believe the (students') storming of the
foreign ministry (Tuesday) is not an isolated incident but part of a
plan," said the airport's managing director Constantino Cespedes.
He said there was an "atmosphere of maximum tension" at the airfield,
which was occupied by about 1,000 students December 12, demanding that
six percent of the government budget be spent on state universities.
They managed to stop at least two international flights from landing.
"It's a very difficult situation," Cespedes acknowledged. "It would be
a very tough blow for the students to take the (airport) building."
Authorities are particularly jittery as Pope John Paul II is due to
visit Managua February 7. The airport would be closed to the public
that day.
The tighter airport security deployment came just hours after
university students briefly took 15 police captive, a day after another
crowd of some 300 armed students boldly took the Philippine and
Pakistani ambassadors hostage in an occupation of the foreign ministry
to press for more public university spending.
Student leaders said several hundred from their ranks nabbed the police
officers Wednesday from a bus near the Managua Military Hospital while
other youths hurled homemade explosive devices. There were no injuries
reported.
The police, members of the special unit in charge of embassy
protection, were held for 30 minutes at the University Engineering
School here.
They were released after the Nicaraguan Human Rights Center and some
student leaders appealed for them to be freed to try to rein in the
unrest.
Meanwhile, hundreds of students gathered at the Central American
University to march to National Police offices to demand the release of
107 detained students, part of the estimated 300 who took part in the
occupation of the foreign ministry.
Among those under arrest were the National Union of Nicaraguan
Students' president, Julio Orozco, and vice president Yudelia Aburto.
The occupation was routed early Wednesday when more than 100 riot
police wearing bullet-proof vests lobbed tear gas into the ministry
around 4:00 a.m. (1000 GMT) and stormed the building, surprising the
sleeping hostage-takers, ministry officials said.
There were no reports of casualties during the attack after a 12-hour
standoff with the students but AFP reporters on the scene saw dozens
being beaten and handcuffed by police outside the building.
Before the police attack, the students had released Ambassadors Manzar
Shafik of Pakistan and Clemencio Montesa of the Philippines along with
most of the women hostages.
There were some unconfirmed reports that most of the students managed
to escape during the brief police attack.
The students -- armed with home-made explosives and carrying signs
demanding bigger university budgets -- had taken over the building at
4:30 p.m. Tuesday.
The two ambassadors were released four hours later and Foreign Minister
Ernesto Leal went inside the building to negotiate with the students.
The release of the two diplomats was a condition set by the government
to begin negotiations with the students, said an official who asked not
to be identified.
Students have been protesting regularly since December to try to press
President Violeta Chamorro's lame-duck government to earmark six
percent of the budget, by their definition, to public universities. A
new president is due to be elected late this year.
In one recent protest December 13, in front of the legislature, a
student was killed in a clash with police which left several others
injured.
Nicaragua's constitution calls for the six percent formula for
university funding but the dispute has been over whether that means six
percent of current accounts, or six percent of all government income
including international funding.
