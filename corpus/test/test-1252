Egyptian FM Condemns Israeli Raids on Palestinians 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Friday strongly condemned Israeli
air strikes against the Palestinian territories, the state-run Middle
East News Agency reported.
Moussa, who is in Washington to prepare for Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's scheduled visit to the U.S. in early April, said the strikes
showed Israeli insistence on violent policies and its violation of the
Fourth Geneva Declaration, which calls for protecting civilians in time
of war and in occupied lands.
The Israeli raids also showed "exaggerated" reaction on the part of the
Israeli forces, thus contravening the U.N. Security Council resolution
which condemns the excessive use of force, he added.
Moussa, who would succeed outgoing Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid in May, said that Egypt condemned Israeli acts " strongly"
when such strikes against civilians were part of a state policy rather
than individual acts of violence.
Israeli army launched air strikes on Gaza and the West Bank cities of
Ramallah and Hebron Wednesday evening, killing two Palestinians and
injuring more than 60 others.
The strikes came apparently in retaliation for a wave of anti- Israeli
bombing attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, which killed several Israelis
and wounded more than 40 others.
The air raids were staged shortly after the closing of an Arab summit
in the Jordanian capital Amman on Wednesday, where Arab leaders pledged
support for the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, against Israeli
occupation.
So far, more than 430 people, most of them Palestinians, have been
killed and thousands of others injured since the eruption of the deadly
Palestinian-Israeli clashes last September.
