Chirac Rejects Papon's Medical Pardon Request 
French President Jacques Chirac has rejected a demand to release former
Vichy official Maurice Papon for health reasons, said the Elysee
presidential palace on Tuesday.
"The president of the republic was asked on December 23, 1999, to grant
a pardon for medical reasons by the lawyer of Maurice Papon. After an
investigation, the head of state has rejected the demand for a medical
pardon," said the communique of Elysee.
Papon, 89, was condemned to 10 years in jail on April 2, 1998, by a
court in Bordeaux, southwest France, for complicity in crimes against
humanity.
As a senior official of the Vichy collaboration regime during World War
II, he was responsible for deporting more than 1,600 Jews from the
southwest Gironde region to Nazi death camps.
