President Calls for Temporary Halt in Peace Process
President Ezer Weizman called Sunday on Israel's government to
temporarily halt peace talks with the PLO and rethink how to proceed
after a suicide bombing in which 18 Israelis were killed.
Speaking on Israel television, Weizman said, ``we have to suspend the
talks until further notice and do some rethinking, very strongly.''
The statement was a departure from the tradition of the office to stay
out of day-to-day politics, but reflected the gravity with which
Israeli leaders are viewing the spate of violence by Islamic militants
that has claimed 51 Israeli lives since Oct. 1.
Weizman made clear that he was calling for suspension and not a
permanent end to the Israel-PLO negotiations which are on the verge of
entering a new phase in which Israel is supposed to withdraw from West
Bank cities so Palestinians can hold elections.
``The Prime Minister (Yitzhak Rabin) and the Israeli government must
delay, stop, look and decide, and then move onwards,'' Weizman said.
He said that he had discussed his recommendation with Rabin before the
Cabinet convened in special session to discuss Israel's response to the
bombing.
Weizman also said that the government should demand that PLO leader
Yasser Arafat make a ``bigger effort, and if you cannot, then some
thinking.''
He also hinted that Rabin should join forces with right-wing leaders in
rethinking the course of peace.
``We have to grit our teeth, be angry, express what we think, but be
full of hope that in a democratic country we can join all forces to
take part in advancing this matter.''
