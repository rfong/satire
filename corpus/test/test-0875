White House supports "twin track" negotitations for Northern Ireland 
With talks between Britain and the Irish Republican Army at a
standstill, President Bill Clinton backed a plan Saturday that would
allow the parties to begin political talks before the IRA disarms.
In a statement, the White House said President Bill Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore endorsed the creation of an international commission
on the disarmament question while the parties simultaneously engage in
constitutional negotations.
The leaders made their views known Friday to Irish Foreign Secretary
Dick Spring during a brief meeting.
Britain has demanded that the IRA begin disarming before it allows the
political wing of the group, Sinn Fein, from participating in
multi-party talks on the status of Ulster.
Sinn Fein leaders have ridiculed the idea, saying it would be insane to
unilaterally disarm while unionists continue to sit on a stockpile of
weapons.
In the statement, the White House said Clinton and Gore, while
reiterating that "guns and bombs must be banished for good in Northern
Ireland," gave support to the "twin track" negotiations on disarmament
and political talks.
"The president and vice-president voiced their hope that all the sides
will continue to be flexible and creative in the search for a lasting
peace," the statement said.
National Security Advisor Anthony Lake had on September 14 told Sinn
Fein leader Gerry Adams that he endorsed the "twin track" approach.
The president reiterated that the "best guarantee of a just and lasting
peace is for all concerned to engage in a meaningful dialogue about
their aspirations for the future," the statement said.
