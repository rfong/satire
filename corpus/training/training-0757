Helicopter Corp. Rejoices at Garrison's Arrival
Engineers from the Harbin Aviation Corporation (HAC) were moved to
tears of joy at the sight on television of their factory's helicopters
crossing into the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tuesday
along with the garrison of People's Liberation Army (PLA).
Since being delivered to the Hong Kong PLA troops, a total of 12
helicopters produced by HAC have been thoroughly tested, registering
21,000 take-offs and landings and clocking up 5,000 hours of safe
flying, said Guo Jingshan, chief designer of HAC. Six of the
helicopters entered Hong Kong as part of the PLA's initial deployment
there.
HAC undertook the task of supplying the garrison with helicopters for
eventual service in Hong Kong back in 1992 when the central government
announced that the detachment's equipment should be both state of the
art and domestically made.
The corporation, based in the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, fulfilled the order for 12 choppers over a 15-month period,
commencing in early 1994.
