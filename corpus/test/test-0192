US secretary of state to make historic Asian tour by Sarah Jackson-Han 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher leaves Saturday for a historic
trip to Asia during which he will normalize ties with Vietnam two
decades after US forces withdrew from Southeast Asia.
"This is an exceedingly important trip and an important time for the
United States and Asia," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said
of Christopher's July 29-August 7 visit.
After delivering a policy speech on Asia here Friday, Christopher
travels to Brunei for the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN)
Post-Ministerial Conference and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) July
31-August 3.
Security discussions in Brunei are expected to cover French nuclear
tests in the Pacific, tensions on the Korean peninsula, and the
disputed Spratly Islands -- considered a major potential flashpoint in
the region.
Alongside the ASEAN meetings, Christopher is to meet with Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at a time of increasingly strained
relations between Washington and Beijing.
Sino-US ties have taken a sharp turn for the worse since the president
of Taiwan paid a private visit here in June over Beijing's vehement
objections.
Chinese authorities have detained an American citizen, human rights
activist Harry Wu, and charged him with espionage during undercover
trips to expose alleged abuses in Chinese prisons.
Both of those issues, along with alleged Chinese missile sales and
bilateral trade issues, are expected to arise in talks between Qian and
Christopher.
Christopher travels to Malaysia on August 3 for talks on regional
economic and security issues, and to Cambodia and Vietnam from August
4-6 for the symbolic highlight of the trip -- normalization of US
relations with Hanoi.
"In Cambodia and Vietnam, we will go to those two countries intent on
remembering the past, reflecting upon the past and the war that we had
there 20-odd years ago," Burns said.
The US delegation will press for resolution of the fate of some 1,600
US troops who went missing in Vietnam, he said, evoking one of the most
bitter legacies of the conflict there and a continuing political sore
point.
"We will also look towards the future," he added, noting that
Christopher would open the US embassy in Hanoi and officials would
discuss the "importance of good Vietnamese-American relations in the
future."
President Bill Clinton announced normalized relations with Vietnam on
July 11, just 17 months after he lifted an embargo imposed at the end
of the Vietnam War.
But analysts and officials here say much remains to be worked out
before Vietnam obtains privileges such as Most Favored Nation (MFN)
trade status.
US and Vietnamese officials are also expected to discuss a range of
issues including trade, human rights, regional security, and efforts to
counter the spread of narcotics from Indochina.
A vocal minority in Congress remains bitterly opposed to normalization
on grounds Vietnam has been insufficiently forthcoming with information
that might resolve the fate of US servicemen missing since the Vietnam
War.
In another sign that 20-year-old wounds are finally healing, Cambodia
reopened its embassy here July 20, two decades after the Khmer Rouge
seized power in Cambodia and the two countries broke off diplomatic
ties.
Christopher's meetings in Phnom Penh are expected to highlight recent
Cambodian moves toward democracy after four brutal years under the
Khmer Rouge and 13 years of civil war that ended with a UN peace accord
in 1991.
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
and Thailand. Vietnam is to join ASEAN on Friday.
