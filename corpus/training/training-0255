Former President's Daughter Has Out-of-Wedlock Baby
The daughter of former President Corazon Aquino, who stunned the nation
last year by announcing she was pregnant by a married man twice her
age, had a baby boy Sunday, hospital staff said.
A nurse at Saint Luke's Hospital said Kris Aquino, 23, gave birth to an
8.5-pound (3.9-kilogram) boy by Caesarean section. The child was in
good condition but the mother was in the ``high-risk'' unit because of
an eye ailment.
The pregnancy had driven a wedge between the former president, a devout
Roman Catholic, and her daughter because the father, actor Philip
Salvador, is married.
Mrs. Aquino said she would forgive her daughter and welcome her
grandchild but that she would never accept Salvador. Mrs. Aquino was in
the United States on Sunday.
Sources close to the father's family said the child would be named
Joshua Phillippe Aquino. Philippine law requires that children born out
of wedlock bear the mother's surname.
Salvador has been seeking an annulment from his wife, who lives in
Queens, New York. Last week, a judge in Quezon City delayed a decision
on the petition for 60 days to allow the wife time to respond to her
husband's request to dissolve their marriage.
There is no divorce in the Philippines although annulments are
sometimes granted.
