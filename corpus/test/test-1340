Iran Urged to End Occupation of Disputed Gulf 
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid Tuesday called on Iran
to "end occupation" of three disputed islands in the Gulf.
Meguid made the call when he spoke to reporters about the dispute
between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran over the sovereignty of
the islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.
He urged the Iranian government to halt further establishment of any
facilities on the islands and demolish the installations already set
up.
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum reasserted support for UAE's
claim of sovereignty over the three islands near the strategic Strait
of Hormuz.
He called on the two countries to resort to peaceful means to end the
dispute on the basis international laws.
Both the UAE and Iran claim ownership of the three islands, on which
Iran deployed troops and civil workers in 1971 when Britain pulled back
from them. The two countries have expressed readiness to solve the
dispute through peaceful means.
The UAE has proposed to solve the problem through international
arbitration while Iran prefer bilateral negotiations.
