SAPTA to Be Lunched at Delhi Summit 
The much-awaited Preferential Trade Arrangement (SAPTA) is to be
formally launched at the three-day eighth summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to be held here from May
2-4, it is learnt here today.
Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao told parliament Friday that
SAPTA would be launched this year at the Delhi summit. Once SAPTA was
operational, SAARC would become an ASEAN-like grouping.
The first round of the proposed trade concessions under SAPTA was
successfully concluded at the standing committee meeting here Friday
and was in the process of finalisation and formal acceptance at the
forthcoming summit, an Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman said.
Concessional tariff among SAARC countries came up for discussion at the
inter-governmental group level during the past two months at Islamabad
and Kathmandu. Al the seven- member countries have exchanged their
proposed tariff concessions, he said.
SAARC, formed in 1985, embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
For the past ten years the SAARC had not been able to make headway in
this direction due to political disputes among the member countries,
especially between India and Pakistan.
Asked whether Pakistan had any reservation on SAPTA, the spokesman said
that the discussion on the issue at various levels of SAARC were
serious and substantial. There was no impression given by any member
country that it was not serious about the proposal.
