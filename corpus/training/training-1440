UNICEF Urges Expanded Effort to Help Landmine 
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Monday called for
widely-expanded effort to help the landmine treaty bear fruit.
Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of UNICEF made the statement on the
occasion of entry-into-force of the Convention on the Prohibition of
the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines
and on their Destruction on March, 1, 1999.
"A giant step has been taken, which shows that the world is more and
more reluctant to use these hidden killers. But the real test lies in
seeing that the treaty is fully implemented, that stockpiles are
destroyed and that demining proceeds rapidly." Bellamy said.
"Universal ratification of the treaty is crucial to ensure that the
production and use of landmines are truly abolished," Bellamy
continued.
"Mine awareness is an essential activity. We have worked and will
continue to work with many partners to make sure that no child in a
mined area is without a clear warning about the danger and how to avoid
it," she said.
"But the true victory will come when such awareness is not needed
because there are no more mines in the ground. The day is not here yet
and it will not be until all the world's nations act to guarantee the
right of children and other innocents to survive in a world free of
these murderous devices," Bellamy added.
UNICEF has been designated within the UN family as the lead agency to
educate and advocate on the landmine issue. Educational campaigns have
centered on teaching children about the danger of landmines and safety
procedures to follow in mined areas. Almost all mined countries served
by UNICEF have an educational program in place.
