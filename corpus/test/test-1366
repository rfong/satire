Senior UN troika to meet in Split 
General Rupert Smith, the commander of UN forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina,
is to meet Friday with UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and General
Bernard Janvier, the supreme commander of UN troops in former
Yugoslavia, the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said.
UNPROFOR would not reveal details of the meeting, saying only that it
would take place in the Croatian port of Split on the Adriatic coast
and that it was a routine gathering of the UN troika.
But the meeting does come at a critical time for UN peacekeepers, 145
of whom are still being held by Bosnian Serbs.
Thursday, Pakistani peacekeepers came under fire from Bosnian Serbs,
while France moved a heavy mortar unit into the demilitarised zone
around Sarajevo in the first troop redeployment since western powers
agreed to plans for a rapid reaction force to protect UN Protection
Force troops in Bosnia.
