Paris/NNP Club/NNP to/TO reschedule/VB Russian/JJ debt/NN over/IN several/JJ years/NNS Western/JJ creditor/NN nations/NNS who/WP hold/VBP 40/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS in/IN Russian/JJ debt/NN agreed/VBD Tuesday/NNP to/TO reschedule/VB payments/NNS over/IN several/JJ years/NNS rather/RB than/IN on/IN a/DT year-to-year/JJ basis/NN as/IN has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT case/NN ,/, Paris/NNP Club/NNP officials/NNS said/VBD ./.

The/DT informal/JJ grouping/NN of/IN creditor/NN countries/NNS met/VBD Tuesday/NNP with/IN a/DT Russian/JJ delegation/NN led/VBN by/IN Deputy/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Oleg/NNP Davidov/NNP to/TO discuss/VB a/DT rescheduling/VBG plan/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT principle/NN of/IN a/DT negotiation/NN that/WDT covers/VBZ more/JJR than/IN one/CD year/NN has/VBZ been/VBN accepted/VBN by/IN the/DT creditors/NNS ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Christian/NNP Noyer/NNP ,/, head/NN of/IN the/DT Paris/NNP Club/NNP ./.

The/DT creditors/NNS could/MD tailor/VB the/DT rescheduling/NN to/TO a/DT program/NN that/IN Russia/NNP is/VBZ negotiating/VBG with/IN the/DT International/NNP Monetary/NNP Fund/NNP for/IN the/DT period/NN 1996-98/NN ./.

Russia/NNP hopes/VBZ this/DT latter/JJ program/NN will/MD be/VB signed/VBN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN and/CC says/VBZ it/PRP will/MD need/VB support/NN from/IN creditors/NNS because/IN the/DT IMF/NNP is/VBZ demanding/VBG more/JJR austerity/NN measures/NNS from/IN Moscow/NNP in/IN exchange/NN for/IN fresh/JJ loans/NNS ./.

Since/IN the/DT Group/NNP of/IN Seven/CD summit/NN in/IN Halifax/NNP ,/, Nova/NNP Scotia/NNP in/IN June/NNP ,/, Russia/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN demanding/VBG from/IN its/PRP$ government/NN creditors/NNS a/DT ``/`` global/JJ accord/NN ''/'' on/IN repayments/NNS that/WDT would/MD spare/VB it/PRP from/IN coming/VBG back/RP every/DT year/NN to/TO ask/VB for/IN grace/NN periods/NNS and/CC rescheduling/VBG ./.

Such/PDT a/DT global/JJ accord/NN would/MD allow/VB Moscow/NNP to/TO know/VB just/RB how/WRB much/JJ its/PRP$ needs/NNS to/TO repay/VB over/IN the/DT next/JJ three/CD years/NNS ./.

Since/IN 1993/CD ,/, Russia/NNP has/VBZ rescheduled/VBN its/PRP$ debt/NN payments/NNS three/CD times/NNS ./.

The/DT first/JJ time/NN involved/VBD 15/CD billion/CD dollars/NNS in/IN debt/NN for/IN the/DT period/NN 1992-93/NN ./.

This/DT latter/JJ accord/NN is/VBZ valid/JJ until/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN but/CC can/MD be/VB extended/VBN if/IN the/DT Paris/NNP Club/NNP does/VBZ not/RB agree/VB on/IN a/DT new/JJ deal/NN by/IN then/RB ./.

But/CC Noyer/NNP said/VBD the/DT group/NN had/VBD agreed/VBN to/TO hold/VB another/DT meeting/NN with/IN Russia/NNP soon/RB ./.
