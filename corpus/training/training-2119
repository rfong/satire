Daley to promote billion dollar deals in Latin American mission 
Commerce Secretary William Daley leaves Saturday for Latin America to
back US companies seeking contracts worth billions of dollars and to
show the flag in the face of stiff competition from Washington's trade
competitors.
Daley, who will be on his first trade mission as commerce secretary,
will lead a delegation of more than 30 US business executives to
Brazil, Argentina and Chile from May 10 to 20.
A department statement said Daley would "send a clear message" to
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and South Korea that the United
States will not leave them an open field in Latin America.
In the past year, according to the department, more than a dozen trade
missions from the six countries visited Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
"The message to our competitors is clear," Daley said here this week.
"The United States government will stand shoulder to shoulder with its
business community in a vigorous public-private partnership."
He pledged that the Clinton administration would "advocate forcefully"
for US businesses bidding on long-term contracts worth several billion
dollars.
But in meetings with heads of state, ministers and business leaders, he
will also advocate continued economic integration as a foundation for a
free trade area of the Americas and will discuss intellectual property
protection, according to the department.
In Brazil Daley will take part in a business forum in Belo Horizonte
and will visit Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
He will also hold talks in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Santiago, Chile.
