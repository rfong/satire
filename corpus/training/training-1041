Ancient City Develops Tourism (1) 
Luoyang in the hinterland province of Henan in China has invited a
group of experts from Beijing University to map out a blueprint for
developing local tourism.
The plan gives details comparing the city with such big international
cities as Berlin, Paris, Bone, Rome, and London in promoting tourism.
Luoyang has formed sister-city relations with cities in Japan, France,
Bulgaria, the Republic of Korea, and the United States.
"We are apparently lag behind other famous international cities, " said
Li Baishuan, secretary of the Luoyang Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC). "However, it is realistic to turn Luoyang into an
excellent tourism city in the new century."
Li visited Rome and Paris last year and was impressed by efforts in the
two cities to protect the environment.
"Modernization does not simply mean high buildings and luxurious
mansions," Li said, adding that "the most important thing is to create
a comfortable living environment for people." ( more)
