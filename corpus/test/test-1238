Man executed for murdering girlfriend 
Texas authorities executed a man Tuesday convicted of murdering his
girlfriend, despite appeals by his defense attorneys that he was
insane.
"I just hope Mrs. Fields is happy now," the man, Vernon Sattiewhite,
said in a last statement referring to the victim's mother, Lillian
Fields, who had urged the execution be carried out swiftly.
The US Supreme Court rejected last-minute appeals claiming that
Sattlewhite was retarded, schizophrenic and insane.
Sattlewhite was charged and convicted in the June 19, 1986 murder of
former girlfriend Sandra Sorrell as she walked to a nursing class with
a new boyfriend. At the time, he was on parole for an earlier murder
conviction,
Witnesses testified that Sattlewaite dragged Sorrell two blocks before
shooting her in the head, saying that if he could not have her, no one
would. He then tried to kill himself.
