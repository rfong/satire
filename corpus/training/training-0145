The closure was imposed under instructions from Israeli caretaker Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak, the radio said.
The move was taken after a shooting attack against Israeli troops in
Rafah on the border with Egypt earlier in the day when one of them was
killed, according to the radio.
This was not immediately confirmed by the Palestinians.
