Japanese PM Not to Visit Yasukuni Shrine on August 15 
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Thursday he would not visit
Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine on August 15, the 54th anniversary of Japan's
surrender in World War II.
"Taking the current circumstances into consideration, I will not make a
visit," Obuchi told reporters at his official residence.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka and eight other cabinet
ministers also said they would not visit the shrine.
"While understanding toward Yasukuni has not advanced in neighboring
countries, I will refrain from visiting on the 15th ( of August) so as
not to cause unnecessary misunderstanding and irritation as a member of
the government," Nonaka told a press conference.
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura, Justice Minister Takao Jinnouchi,
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazwa, Education Minister Akito Arima,
International Trade and Industry Minister Kaoru Yosano, Defense Agency
chief Hosei Norota, Home Affairs Minister Takeshi Noda and Economic
Planning Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya also have made clear that they
would not visit the shrine.
Meanwhile, eight ministers including Environment Agency chief Kenji
Manabe and Transport Minister Jiro Kawasaki, however, expressed their
intention to visit the shrine, a bastion of the wartime
government-sponsored Shintoism and symbol of militarism in Japan before
and during World War II.
The shrine houses the memorial tablets of 14 class-A war criminals,
including wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, and some 2.4 million
Japanese military personnel and officials who died since 1853 in
Japan's various wars.
Cabinet ministers' visits to the shrine have drawn criticism from Asian
countries and are also controversial because Japan's postwar
Constitution stipulates separation of the state and religion.
