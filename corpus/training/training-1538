Boris Yeltsin dies of alcohol deprivation
In a stunning St George's Day development the Kremlin has announced that
former Russian President Boris and Olympic-standard vodka drinker Boris
Yeltsin has died.
Yeltsin was 76 and set the nation's gold standard for alcohol intake
during the cold war years of the Reagan/Bush1 Administration as well as
later when replacing Mikhail Gorbachev in a 1991 coup.
The official cause of death has not yet been announced but alcohol
deprivation remains a top possibility after doctors made him go
teetotal or unbdergo a liver transplant.
Some reports however say that Plutonium 210 has not been altogether
ruled out and neither has the organic toxin wolfbane which recently
despatched Pakstani cricket coach Bob Woolmer.
Yeltsin became Russia's first democratically (sic) elected president
after Gorbachev was busted by the KGB for ratting onn his own security
service personel in an insider corruption probe about vodka grain
futures.
The 76 year old former Russian president attracted universal derision
in a series of highly publicised TV comedy sketches where he fell over
while pissed during official engagement with visitng foreign
dignitaries.
His daughters Svetlana and Perestroika have been linked to every major
Russian credit card fraud investigated since 1995 and the source of
their recent inexsplicable wealth has been traced to the UN
Oil-for-Fraud Saddam scam of 2001.
However, not even a massive quintuple Interpol fraud investigation
by-pass could erase the magnitude of the Yetsin family's mobster
activities and the former paterfamilias of this clan remains a legend
in crime cartels across the globe.
He handed over the reins of power to ex-KGB hitman Vlad 'The Impaler'
Putain on 31st December 1999 and had remained a reclusive immune from
prosecution ever since.
A full state funeral is expected on Friday.
