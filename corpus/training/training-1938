Hong Kong activists plan series of anti-Japanese protest 
Hong Kong activists were Thursday planning more anti-Japanese protests
here over the latest landings by Japanese on disputed islands in the
East China Sea, a spokesman for the group said.
"The series of protests will show our determination to land on the
islands," the spokesman for the Action Committee for Defending the
Diaoyu Islands said.
The group planned to set sail to the islands, known as Diaoyus to
Chinese and Senkakus to the Japanese, on May 18 and camp there for four
to five days.
A group of about 40 people will fly from Hong Kong to Taipei and team
up with 100 protesters from Taiwan and the United States to carry out
the mission. The islands are claimed by China, Japan and Taiwan.
The activists, who staged a noisy protest outside the Japanese
consulate here yesterday, plan a street exhibition this Saturday and a
street march on Sunday
The protests were sparked by two landings on the islands by Japanese
rightwingers in the past two weeks.
Tung Chee-hwa, who becomes Hong Kong's chief executive when the
territory is return to China on July 1, has called for calm after
returning from a day of talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing on
Wednesday.
The protests started last year when Japanese built lighthouses and
raised flags on the islands.
On September 26, a Hong Kong activist David Chan drowned when
attempting to land on the uninhabited islands, situated 150 kilometers
(90 miles) northeast of Taiwan.
