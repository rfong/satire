More Fossils of Dinosaur Found in Yuanmou Man's Home 
Archaeologists recently excavated two more complete sets of dinosaur
skeletons in the county of Yuanmou, the "home of Yuanmou Man, in the Yi
Autonomous Prefecture of Chuxiong, in southwest China's Yunnan
Province.
The excavation began in late April after a villager in the county
discovered a fossil in last November which was later confirmed as a
fossilized dinosaur.
Experts believed that the finding is another major archaeological
discovery following the find of the first Yuanmou Man in 1965 at
Shangnabang Village in Yuanmou County.
Yuanmou Man which dates back to around 1.7 million years ago is the
earliest homo sapien found in China.
The latest three fossils which belong to the Cretaceous Period (some
135 million and 60 million years ago) may help explain possible reasons
for the extinction of dinosaurs and the origin of human and the
relationships between dinosaur and human beings.
Yunnan is abundant in various pithecanthropus fossils.
