Philippine Businessmen Protest High Interest Rates 
Hundreds of businessmen in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao
closed shops Monday to protest against high interest rates being
imposed by local banks.
Augusto Velarde, head of a provincial business association, said 90
percent of business in Marbel town, South Cotabato were paralyzed.
He said that the businessmen were against what they said excessive
lending rates of 30 to 38 percent set by local banks, adding that the
action only meant to serve as indignation over the banks' unreasonable
rates increase.
However, Deogracias Vistan, head of the Bankers Association of the
Philippines, said bankers were already directed on February 2 to lower
the interest rates by one percent every week until it falls at around
21 percent.
Vistan said that any unreasonable increases should be immediately
reported to the Bankers Association of the Philippines for proper
action.
On the same day, some 1,000 people from different sectors held a
peaceful rally at a park in South Cotabato, asking for the lowering of
the interest rates.
