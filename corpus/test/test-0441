Australia Closes to U.S. for Obesity Number 
Australia has turned out to be second to the United States for its
overweight population, according to a recent national survey made by
the New South Wales Center for the Advancement of Adolescent Health.
The Australian Associated Press quoted Michael Booth from the center as
saying that more than 20 percent of children were overweight or obese.
The level of obesity had more than doubled in the last 15 years,
reaching 18 percent of men and women in Australia, and 20 percent of
men and 25 percent of women in the United States.
About 50 percent of Australian women and more than 60 percent of men
were now classified as overweight.
According to the survey, Australians eat too much meat and dairy
products and too little vegetables. Meanwhile they become lazier and
physically exercised only an average of one hour a week. One fourth of
the population are threatened by diabetes and heart diseases.
