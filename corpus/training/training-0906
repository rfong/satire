Backing up too far, he used his right hand in taking evasive action
from a throw to the bowler's end from Robert Kennedy at cover, after
Shivnarine Chanderpaul had played a delivery from Chris Harris.
Adams and Chanderpaul shared a fifth wicket stand of 125, but both had
to endure a torid morning from Danny Morrison.
Fined 10 percent of his match fee by referee Mike Denness for an
apparent breach of conduct after a futile appeal for an lbw verdict
against Brian Lara on Saturday, Morrison delivered easily his best two
spells on tour in the period, which West Indies ended at 381 for four.
Although neither Morrison nor New Zealand captured a wicket, life was
made difficult for Adams and Chanderpaul as Morrison delivered
short-balls into their ribs and evinced an uncharacteristic hook from
Chanderpaul that dropped short of long leg fielder Larsen.
Lee Germon removed Morrison after 40 minutes and five overs that cost
eight runs, but it was after his departure that both batsmen began to
score freely. They made 62 in the next 80 minutes, during which
Morrison returned for four overs before the interval that went for 13.
West Indies reached 495 for six at tea, Adams accouting for 10 of the
17 four struck in the period en route to 176 not out.
Germnan persisted with Harris and Patel for most of the session, though
neither could stop the flood of runs nor capture enough wickets.
Patel had Chanderpaul, whose 41 was brought to an end when he drove at
a flighted delivery and the ball flew off the leading edge into the lap
of Nathan Astle at cover.
If New Zealand hoped things would improve, they were disappointed.
Lately the West Indian bowlers have been propping up the innings with a
few useful scores and Ian Bishop made 14 in a partnership of 47 for the
seventh wicket with Adams, who gained support from Ambrose (21 not out)
in adding 53 unbroken for the eighth wicket.
