Ernie Els Missing After Entering Woods To Find Golf Ball
South African golfer Ernie Els followed an errant golf ball into the scrub
woods of the Dove Mountain course rough Wednesday during the Accenture
Match Play tournament and has now been missing for over 36 hours, PGA
officials have announced. "Els went too long on the fifth hole and struck
his ball into a dense stand of sage, creosote tree, and saguaro cactus from
which both Els and his ball have yet to emerge," the PGA's Ana Laird told
reporters, struggling to be heard over the drone of rescue helicopters
combing the brush. "We are unsure if Els was carrying water, matches, or
any of the survival equipment the PGA recommends our golfers take into the
rough as a matter of routine, but we stress that he will not be in danger
until 96 hours have passed, and will only be assessed a three-stroke
penalty." Though no sign of Els has been found, rescuers investigating
circling buzzards over the sand trap on the par 4 dogleg-right sixth hole
fairway have found what they believe to be the desiccated remains of John
Daly.
