Some 160 South Koreans injured in clashes over Uruguay Round 
Some 160 people were injured here Saturday in clashes between riot
police and anti-US demonstrators opposed to parliamentary ratification
of the new global trade accord, police and reports said.
The fighting erupted when some 3,000 riot police stormed into Seoul's
Hongik Unversity, firing barrages of tear gas, to rescue 54 officers
held hostage by some 600 radical students, police said.
At least 110 policemen and 50 students were injured in the most violent
demonstration since President Kim Young-Sam took office in Februay
1993, the Yonhap news agency said.
Police arrested 100 students after rescuing the captured officers in a
three-hour operation during which students fought back with fire bombs,
rocks and steel pipes, the news agency said.
Later in the day, some 7,000 students, dissidents and farmers joined a
street march against parliamentary ratification of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) pact, shouting anti-US slogans.
"Let's drive out the Yankees," yelled the protesters, slamming
Washington for alleged trade pressure and demanding South Korea reject
the pact.
The demonstrators also accused Washington of heightening tension on the
Korean peninsula and called for talks between South and North Korea to
solve the nuclear crisis -- unaware that as they marched President Kim
Young-Sam had accepted an invitation to meet with his Stalinist
counterpart in the North.
