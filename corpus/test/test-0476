Clinton Rejects Talk of No Gun Ri "Whitewash" 
President Bill Clinton rejected allegations Friday that the United
States "whitewashed" an investigation of the killing of unarmed Korean
civilians by American soldiers early in the Korean war.
Elaborating on his own statement of regret about the shootings, he
said, "We are profoundly sorry."
Eight days before leaving office, the president sought to ease the
unhappiness of South Korean survivors and family members who had sought
a direct apology and were disappointed by the U.S. Army 's finding
which failed to hold any individuals responsible for the slayings.
Clinton said, "I don't think there's any difference in the two words" -
regret and apology - because "they both mean that we are profoundly
sorry for what happened and that things happened which were wrong."
The president made his remarks in a brief question and answer session
after releasing the final economic report of his administration.
On Thursday, survivors of the refugee killing by American GIs at No Gun
Ri angrily denounced as a whitewash the U.S. report that the there was
no evidence that the soldiers were ordered to kill.
They said the report was "full of excuses," and the Americans need to
be more frank about their past wrongdoings.
