In/IN an/DT important/JJ step/NN toward/IN the/DT resumption/NN of/IN long-stalled/JJ peace/NN talks/NNS between/IN the/DT government/NN and/CC peasant/NN rebels/NNS in/IN the/DT southern/JJ state/NN of/IN Chiapas/NNP ,/, the/DT two/CD sides/NNS have/VBP settled/VBN on/IN mediators/NNS for/IN a/DT new/JJ dialogue/NN ./.

In/IN an/DT effort/NN to/TO address/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT root/NN causes/NNS of/IN the/DT year-old/JJ rebellion/NN ,/, the/DT government/NN also/RB promised/VBD on/IN Wednesday/NNP to/TO begin/VB confiscating/VBG and/CC redistributing/VBG some/DT illegally/RB large/JJ private/JJ landholdings/NNS in/IN the/DT state/NN ./.

The/DT move/NN toward/IN new/JJ talks/NNS came/VBD in/IN a/DT communique/NN from/IN leaders/NNS of/IN the/DT rebel/NN Zapatista/NNP National/NNP Liberation/NNP Army/NNP that/WDT was/VBD dated/VBN Dec./NNP 25/CD and/CC made/VBD public/JJ on/IN Tuesday/NNP night/NN in/IN the/DT Chiapas/NNP city/NN of/IN San/NNP Cristobal/NNP de/IN las/NNP Casas/NNP ./.

The/DT message/NN brought/VBD the/DT insurgents/NNS '/POS first/JJ conciliatory/JJ words/NNS for/IN the/DT government/NN in/IN months/NNS ./.

Saluting/VBG the/DT decision/NN of/IN President/NNP Ernesto/NNP Zedillo/NNP Ponce/NNP de/IN Leon/NNP 's/POS government/NN to/TO put/VB aside/RP its/PRP$ earlier/JJR opposition/NN to/TO a/DT commission/NN of/IN eight/CD intermediaries/NNS led/VBN by/IN the/DT Roman/NNP Catholic/NNP bishop/NN of/IN San/NNP Cristobal/NNP ,/, Samuel/NNP Ruiz/NNP Garcia/NNP ,/, the/DT rebels/NNS indicated/VBD that/IN they/PRP were/VBD now/RB ready/JJ for/IN negotiations/NNS to/TO begin/VB ./.

The/DT government/NN responded/VBD by/IN ordering/VBG the/DT retreat/NN of/IN army/NN soldiers/NNS who/WP ,/, in/IN their/PRP$ most/RBS aggressive/JJ deployment/NN since/IN a/DT cease-fire/NN nearly/RB a/DT year/NN ago/RB ,/, had/VBD taken/VBN up/RP positions/NNS inside/IN the/DT area/NN that/IN the/DT Zapatistas/NNPS consider/VBP to/TO be/VB under/IN their/PRP$ control/NN ./.

Hours/NNS after/IN the/DT Defense/NNP Ministry/NNP issued/VBD a/DT statement/NN justifying/VBG its/PRP$ occupation/NN of/IN two/CD villages/NNS in/IN the/DT Lacandon/NNP rain/NN forest/NN ,/, Zedillo/NNP 's/POS office/NN said/VBD they/PRP had/VBD been/VBN withdrawn/VBN ``/`` with/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN promoting/VBG the/DT relaxation/NN of/IN tensions/NNS in/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN Chiapas/NNP ./. ''/''

Although/IN exchange/NN was/VBD perhaps/RB more/RBR symbolic/JJ than/IN substantive/JJ ,/, it/PRP appeared/VBD likely/JJ to/TO break/VB a/DT cycle/NN of/IN hostility/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD sides/NNS ./.

Angered/VBN by/IN what/WP they/PRP asserted/VBD was/VBD the/DT fraudulent/JJ election/NN of/IN a/DT Chiapas/NNP governor/NN from/IN Zedillo/NNP 's/POS governing/VBG party/NN ,/, Eduardo/NNP Robledo/NNP Rincon/NNP ,/, the/DT Zapatistas/NNPS declared/VBD the/DT formal/JJ cease-fire/NN broken/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ inauguration/NN on/IN Dec./NNP 8/CD ./.

They/PRP then/RB rejected/VBD a/DT commission/NN of/IN legislators/NNS from/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS main/JJ political/JJ parties/NNS that/IN Zedillo/NNP had/VBD named/VBN to/TO intercede/VB in/IN the/DT conflict/NN ./.

And/CC in/IN a/DT relatively/RB insignificant/JJ action/NN on/IN Dec./NNP 19/CD that/IN they/PRP nonetheless/RB announced/VBD as/IN a/DT major/JJ new/JJ offensive/NN ,/, the/DT rebels/NNS emerged/VBD from/IN their/PRP$ strongholds/NNS to/TO briefly/NN seize/VB a/DT town/NN and/CC several/JJ villages/NNS and/CC to/TO block/VB several/JJ highways/NNS ./.

``/`` This/DT is/VBZ very/RB encouraging/VBG for/IN us/PRP ,/, ''/'' a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT mediating/JJ commission/NN ,/, Alberto/NNP Szekely/NNP ,/, said/VBD on/IN Wednesday/NNP ./.

The/DT rebels/NNS '/POS change/NN in/IN tone/NN was/VBD also/RB significant/JJ because/IN it/PRP came/VBD in/IN their/PRP$ first/JJ statement/NN since/IN the/DT Mexican/JJ economy/NN was/VBD plunged/VBN into/IN crisis/NN by/IN a/DT devaluation/NN of/IN the/DT peso/NN ./.
