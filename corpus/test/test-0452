The National Football League -- which made overtures this weekend about
building a new football stadium in Los Angeles -- should focus its
efforts on renovating the Coliseum instead, local officials said.
``I don't know if there is any need for a new stadium,'' said Los
Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. ``The Coliseum is
now earthquake safe, it's the only stadium that meets current building
standards and, in terms of amenities, those are moving along as a
matter of course,'' Burke said. ``We are also making improvements to
the entire Exposition Park area.''
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Sunday said he was looking to
develop a partnership with the city and state on construction of a
stadium in Los Angeles to order to ensure the continued presence of an
NFL team in the region.
The stadium would then become the site of the Super Bowl on a
semipermanent basis.
Tagliabue, however, provided no details of where the stadium would be
located or how it would be financed.
``There really isn't more detail at this point,'' NFL Communications
Director Greg Aiello said Monday. ``It's just an idea that was
discussed very briefly at the end of the owners' meeting last week in
Houston.
``The commissioner just said he would like the Super Bowl policy
committee to consider having a semipermanent site. Los Angeles makes
sense because we've had the most Super Bowls there and is ideal from a
variety of standpoints, from the weather to the hotels to other
facilities.''
Aiello cautioned that the proposal would have a long way to go in
getting the approval of the owners.
``There are a lot of unanswered questions, but it's a concept that's
interesting in using the Super Bowl to get a stadium built,'' Aiello
said.
But Burke said she already has contacted NFL officials to encourage
them on the selection of Los Angeles and to consider use of the
Coliseum, which recently underwent a $60 million improvement as the
result of earthquake damage.
``If they want to have the Super Bowl here every other year, we'll be
able to afford whatever improvements they want us to make,'' said
Burke, whose district includes the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan was out of the city on vacation, but
his office said he also supports the selection of the Coliseum.
Steve Soboroff, who chairs the city's Recreation and Parks Commission
and sits on the Coliseum Commission, said Tagliabue's comments were
encouraging to him.
``We are only $30 million to $40 million away from having a world-class
football stadium and we are working hard on that,'' Soboroff said. ``We
will be doing this work anyway and have to have it in place by the
start of the football season next year.''
Among the work to be completed is a new press box that will have all
the modern communications equipment now needed. There also are plans to
add from 85 to 90 luxury suites to be built between the goal lines.
Soboroff said the commission is now studying various financing options
to pay for the work as he questioned whether a new facility would be
needed.
``Why would they want to spend 10 times what we need for a new facility
when we will have everything they want?'' he said.
Don Webb, who is overseeing the renovation work at the facility, was
involved in discussions with Tagliabue, Burke and Riordan earlier this
year on whether the Coliseum repairs would be completed in time for
this season.
``He was concerned if it would be done in time and if it would be
satisfactory to the NFL,'' Webb said. ``We proved both these out. The
Coliseum is now the safest stadium and has all modern facilities and
amenities.''
Webb said Tagliabue also was interested in other improvements being
planned for the Exposition Park area, such as providing greater
parking.
``Exposition Park is perfect for a Super Bowl because they have all
these corporate sponsors and there aren't many places that can have a
park like setting for their tents and other operations,'' Webb said.
Also, presumably, the project would help the Coliseum in keeping the
Los Angeles Raiders at the facility.
Officials with the Raiders, who have a one-year contract for the
Coliseum, did not return telephone calls.
In the meantime, Oakland, Calif. officials have come up with a new plan
to try to lure the Raiders back to the Bay Area, which the team left in
1982.
The Associated Press reported the Oakland proposal would issue bonds to
pay for improvements at Oakland Coliseum, with the bonds to be paid off
by football revenue.
It would give Raiders managing general partner Al Davis luxury boxes
and 11,000 parking spaces adjacent to the facility if he returned the
team to Oakland.
