Philippine, US FMs sign extradition, mutual legal assistance treaties 
The Philippine and US foreign secretaries on Sunday signed extradition
and mutual legal assistance treaties in an effort to boost the fight
against global drug rings and international fraud.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Philippine Foreign
Secretary Roberto Romulo signed the Extradition Treaty and the Mutual
Legal Assistance Treaty at the presidential palace in Manila.
The signing ceremonies were witnessed by President Fidel Ramos and US
President Bill Clinton, who will leave later Sunday for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Indonesia after a
22-hour stopover in Manila.
Both treaties were negotiated this year following a visit by Ramos to
Washington in late 1993.
Christopher said in a speech that the signing showed the two nations'
"solidarity in the fight against international drug trafficking and
organized crime."
He warned: "Let our action here today serve notice to criminals in both
our countries that the United States and the Philippines will stand
united to defeat them. We are determined that they will not succeed."
The extradition treaty would allow both nations to repatriate fugitives
in each other's territories, while the mutual legal assistance pact
enables Manila and Washington to exchange information needed for the
prosecution of suspects.
The agreements need the approval of both the US and Philippine senates
before they can be implemented. Both foreign secretaries said they
would seek their legislatures' early approval of the treaties.
Several fugitives from the Philippines have sought refuge in the United
States, where many Filipinos have relatives.
Philippine and US officials have said that Manila was being used as a
transshipment point of drugs to the United States and Europe. Many of
these drug gangs engage the services of the world-class Filipino
forgers or bribe corrupt law enforcers here.
