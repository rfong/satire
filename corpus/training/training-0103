Dollar higher as market awaits Fed announcement 
The dollar was higher against other major currencies Thursday except
the pound with traders waiting for an annoucement by the Federal
Reserve's Open Market Committee.
Gold meanwhile shed 70 cents to 385.20 dollars per ounce from the
closing price Wednesday.
Around 10:10 a.m. (1410 GMT), the dollar was worth 1.3825 German marks
against 1.3795 marks late Wednesday. The greenback was also trading at
85.19 yen (84.80). In London, it was worth 1.3815 marks and 85.12 yen
at mid-session.
The US dollar also gained against the French and Swiss currencies,
rising to 4.8367 French francs (4.8265) and 1.1484 Swiss francs
(1.1445).
But the dollar slipped against the pound sterling to 0.6262 (0.6266).
Initial reaction to an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve would
be a net slide by the dollar, but analysts predict the fall won't last
long.
Some analysts expect the Fed to take no action Thursday apart from
asking Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to cut rates when he
decides the time is right.
But Greenspan could decide to wait for the release of unemployment
figures on Friday before taking a decision.
Statistics released Thursday showing unemployment claims unchanged and
a 0.2 percent drop in May economic indicators aggravated confusion on
the markets.
The greenback was expected to trade between 1.3720 and 1.3880 marks for
the remainder of Thursday.
