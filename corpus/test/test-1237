Taliban-Iran talks fail to improve ties: spokesman 
Talks between an Iranian delegation and Afghan Taliban leaders this
week failed to improve the uneasy relations between Tehran and the
Islamic militia, a Taliban spokesman said Saturday.
Mufti Mohammad Masoom Afghani, who is based at Quetta in Pakistan, told
AFP the delegation was told that Iran had a "one-sided and partial
attitude" to the Afghan conflict.
"We told them that Tehran is therefore not in a position to play any
mediatory role," Afghani said, adding that the delegation returned home
after the talks at Kandahar, the main Taliban base in southern
Afghanistan.
The Kandahar governor and several members of the Taliban governing
council participated in the talks with the Iranians, he said.
Afghani alleged that Iranians had backed recent attacks in Islam Qila
and Nimroze areas by the Afghan "fugitives," a reference to pro-Rabbani
men who fled into Iran when Taliban captured the western Herat region
in September.
The allegation is denied by Tehran, which recognises the Afghan
government headed by President Bhurhanuddin Rabbani and wants a
negotiated settlment to the civil war in Afghanistan.
Iran has been wary of the Taliban, led by religious students trained in
Koranic schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan, since they burst onto the
scene in November 1994.
The Taliban militia, which controls about half of Afghanistan, is
currently besieging Kabul with the aim of toppling Rabbani and
installing Islamic law throughout the war-torn country.
Rabbani's recent offer to travel to the provincial strongholds of his
rivals for peace talks was first rejected by Taliban but they later
softened their stand saying they might consider this after receiving
full details.
"We have not received the required details yet," Afghani said.
Another anti-Rabbani force, an alliance of four parties, has neither
publicly rejected nor accepted the president's offer.
The main parties in this coalition are Uzbek leader general Abdul
Rashid Dostam's National Islamic Movement and former premier Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami.
