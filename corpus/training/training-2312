African Church Conference Opens in Addis Ababa 
The plenary sessions of the seventh assembly of the All Africa
Conference of Churches (AACC) opened at the United Nations Conference
Center here today.
The sessions were divided into three groups, dealing respectively with
issues concerning youth, women and African churches. Prior to the
plenary sessions, an opening joint meeting was held.
In his speech at the joint meeting, representative of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Burundi, Michel Sidibe, said more
than two million African children have lost their lives in armed
conflicts, and three times that figure have either been injured or
permanently disabled.
It was the responsibility of the participants to lead Africans to be
able to deal with "the deeper psychological, moral and spiritual
dimensions of the human dilemma at this crossroads in history," he
said.
The main conference of the AACC will be held here from October 4 to 10
and representatives from about 150 churches from nearly 40 African
countries will attend the conference.
