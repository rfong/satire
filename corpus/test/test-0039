Brazil and Holland struggle in first half 
Brazil and Holland looked anything but World Cup quarter-finalists as
they ended a lacklustre first half 0-0 here on Saturday.
While the Brazilians controlled the midfield for most of the opening 45
minutes they found opportunities to get past the solid Dutch defence
few and far between.
With the promised blazing sunshine hidden behind storm clouds that
moved into the area earlier in the morning, both teams were having
trouble guaging the strong wind swirling around the stadium.
Brazil's best chance came after 15 minutes when Dunga flighted a long
ball wide to Bebeto on the right. His centre found Romario but the
Barcelona striker shot wide.
The Dutch were having even more trouble than the Brazilians in getting
going.
A 26th minute foul on Peter Van Vossen out on the left wing by Aldair
set up a free kick that found Holland's danger man Dennis Bergkamp
unmarked in the area but his header went well over.
Four minutes later in another rare Dutch attack Bergkamp found an inch
of space just inside the area but his right footed shot only found the
side netting.
Brazil tried to step up the pace in the final ten minutes. A Bebeto
free kick from the left after Aron Winter brought down Branco, in for
the banned Leornado, found Romario but his header was tipped away for a
corner.
Marcio Santos went close with a header four minutes from time and
seconds before the final whistle Romario burst through. Zinho squared
the ball to an unmarked Aldair who somehow managed to miss.
