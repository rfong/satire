Inmate describes North Korean prison "hell" 
A Chinese man jailed for espionage in North Korea described Tuesday how
he had been tortured in prisons which were were "like hell."
Huang Longshui, 47, said he spent six years in the Sungho detention
center until discharged in 1990.
He said North Korean jailers severely beat him on the legs with square
timbers. Huang told how he was once forced to eat 50-grammes (1.5
ounces) of salt without water as a punishment.
Prisoners also ate insects and rats to boost their meager rice or wheat
rations, he added. "It was terrible," Huang said. "Prisoners live in a
place like a hell."
Some inmates were forced into water for long periods while others had
to live in a six-square-meter (65-square-feet) cell with two other
prisoners.
Huang is in Japan to approach the government to ask Pyongyang to
release Kozo Shibata, a Japanese friend whose jail term finished in
1990 but is still said to be detained in North Korea.
Shibata was also arrested for spying and had been imprisoned for 30
years.
Huang met Shibata in 1982 in Sungho. The North Korean authorities have
said Shibata was released and died in January 1990 in a train accident.
Huang said Shibata was alive and still in prison in December 1990 when
Huang was released.
