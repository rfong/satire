Philippines to Float More Eurobond 
The Central Bank of the Philippines will issue additional 50-million to
100-million-U.S. dollar eurobond this week to raise more funds for
paying off maturing short-term debts, the Today newspaper said Monday.
Gabriel Singson, governor of the Central Bank, was quoted as saying
that the bank's approval of the additional eurobond issuance comes on
the heels of the 300-million-U.S. dollar eurobond flotation more than a
week ago.
"We (still) have some short-term loans maturing soon," Singson said.
The bond issuance will coincide with the government's road show for the
planned 500-million-U.S. dollar eurobond flotation, the third time the
Finance Department is tapping the international markets for funds under
the present administration.
The Philippine government has indicated it is open to more foreign
borrowings this year to remove upward pressure on domestic interest
rates, analysts said.
But they are divided on whether the government should continue to pile
up borrowings considering the country's growing debt stock.
Some are concerned that the debt stock is growing too rapidly, while
others agree the twin objectives of hammering down domestic interest
rates and keeping the economy growing should be a paramount concern.
