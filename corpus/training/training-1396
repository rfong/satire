Pakistan-US to Discuss Non-Proliferation Agenda
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said Monday that Pakistan and the U.S.
will discuss a five-point non-proliferation agenda during U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's visit early next month.
Talking to reporters at the Parliament lobby, Aziz said the two
countries will discuss matters relating to the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty, deployment of nuclear
weapons, export control and the Pakistan-India ties with special
reference to the Kashmir issue.
Aziz said the Nuclear Regulatory Authority bill would be introduced in
the National Assembly within six to eight weeks to tighten control over
exports of nuclear technology and sensitive materials to a third
country.
An autonomous body will be set up with the participation of Pakistan
Atomic Energy Commission and other related institutions to deal with
the nuclear program, he added.
Aziz also said he was sending letters to member countries of the G-8
(Group of Eight) to convey Pakistan's serious concern over the recent
defense deal between Russia and India.
There is a need to control the arms race rather than inking more deals
for the spread of traditional weapons, he said.
