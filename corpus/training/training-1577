Tanzania Encourages Livestock Sales for Better Life 
The Tanzanian government has encouraged its livestock keepers to sell
adequate amount of the animals in exchange for a better life, local
newspapers reported Sunday.
Vice-president Omar Ali Juma told a workshop Saturday in northern town
of Arusha that though Tanzania has the third largest number of
livestock in Africa after Ethiopia and Sudan, the sector has
contributed only 18 percent to the GDP.
In contrast, he said, countries like Botswana and Namibia have far
smaller number of livestock, their livestock industries have
contributed 45 percent and 25 percent to the GDP respectively.
Botswana has about 1 million heads of cattle while Namibia has 1.5
million compared to Tanzania's some 35 million heads of cattle, goats,
chicken and pigs.
"We must reverse this and revive and modernize the industry to help
boost export earnings," he told an 18-man Livestock Advisory Committee.
He advised the committee to look into ways of changing the trend
through the application of modern methods of raising livestock and
improving quality in breeding and packaging meat and also stressed the
revival of livestock training centers.
The government will bear the costs of vaccinating these animals at an
initial stage against diseases such as rinderpest, foot and mouth
diseases and tse-tse flies, he said.
