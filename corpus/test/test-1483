Bank of England Denies Rewarding Reckless Lenders
Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, today denied that its
recent initiative to free up the financial markets amounted to a bail
out of the very institutions responsible for creating the problems.
The arrangement involves swapping valuable Treasury bills for less
liquid assets held by hard hit banks.
"The intruments we will accept in exchange for Treasury bills are
perfectly good assets," said King in response to concerns that the tax
payer would be left with increased risk as a result of the initiative.
"There is nothing risky about a the value of a second hand Ford Cortina
and we are very grateful to RBS for securitising a half chewed toffee
and a blackie's egg."
"This is merely about improving liquidity" said King. "Hic!"
