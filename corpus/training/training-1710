Ukraine Faces No Parliamentary Crisis: Official 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's parliamentary representative Roman
Bessmertny said here today there will be no parliamentary crisis in
fall.
Denying predictions for such a crisis by some politicians and members
of parliament, Bessmertny said, "There are enough wise people in the
parliament who are capable of implementing the Ukrainian constitution."
He explained that some lawmakers attempted to convene a special session
on August 28 and 29 to consider amendments to the constitution.
Local press reported that the proposed amendments would virtually
eliminate the president's right of veto and strip him of the power to
fire the prime minister without legislative backing.
Bessmertny also said that he saw no obstacles to the parliamentary
adoption of the 1998 draft budget, adding that adoption of the 1998
budget would be facilitated by the recent appointment of Viktor Suslov
as the economics minister.
Suslov had been the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for Finance
and Banking before his latest appointment.
The new cabinet was formed on July 25.
