FAO to Help Sri Lanka Rehabilitate Jaffna Peninsula 
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the U.N. has decided to
provide 376,000 U.S. dollars to support the coordination of agriculture
rehabilitation in the Jaffna Peninsula in the Northern province of Sri
Lanka, according to the Finance Ministry here Monday.
The FAO through its technical cooperation program has provided to Sri
Lanka the assistance for the technical coordination of emergency
assistance on the agriculture rehabilitation and supply of emergency
kits to affected farmers and fishermen in the Jaffna Peninsula, the
ministry sources said.
This project is a request made by the Sri Lankan government in June,
1996. FAO immediately responded to the request at that time, the
sources added.
The Jaffna Peninsula which was once the stronghold of the Tamil rebels,
was recaptured in May 1995 by the government troops who are making
every effort to stabilize the civil administration in the peninsula.
