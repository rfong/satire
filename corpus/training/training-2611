Zimbabwean High Court Postpones Sentencing of Former President
The High Court of Zimbabwe Thursday postponed to January 18 next year
the sentencing of former president Canaan Banana who has been convicted
of 11 counts of sodomy offenses.
The High Court in Harare was scheduled to pass sentence on Thursday
morning on Banana who is on the run and believed to be in South Africa.
Banana, 62, fled the country before the High Court convicted him on
November 26, of all the 11 counts of sodomy, attempted sodomy and
indecent assault leveled against him.
The state has issued a warrant for his arrest and sought the assistance
of Interpol to bring Banana back to Zimbabwe.
The charges against Banana surfaced during the trial of his former
aide-de-camp, Jefta Dube who is now serving a 10-year jail term for
killing his colleague who had teased him as "Banana's wife".
Dube had told the court during his trial that the former president
sexually abused him.
Some of Banana's former cooks, security guards and other males he
picked from the streets, also alleged that the former president had
sodomized them while he was still in office and after, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported Thursday.
Homosexuality is illegal in Zimbabwe and can carry a jail term of two
years or more.
