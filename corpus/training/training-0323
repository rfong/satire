European Hostages May Be Freed Tomorrow: Bangladeshi Minister 
The ultimatum issued by the government two days back to the abductors
of three Europeans hostages in dense forest of Chittagong Hill Tracts
(CHT) is likely to yield positive results in bringing an end to the
17-day hostage drama, the Independent newspaper reported here Sunday.
The hostages would be released within a day or two on only one
condition that the abductors would be exempted from all illegal
charges, Minister for CHT affairs Kalparanjan Chakma said in Rangamati
Saturday evening.
"All the three hostages are in good health and they will return within
two days at the maximum," Kalparanjan Chakma said confidently.
Kalparanjan issued an ultimatum to the abductors of two Danes and one
Briton on Thursday to release the hostages by Sunday morning or face a
massive military offensive.
"When the army launches the offensive, I will not take any
responsibility for anything that may happen to your homes and lives,"
said the minister in the ultimatum. The deadline, however, was on
Friday extended to Monday.
The minister refused to give details, saying that might harm the
positive development. "The only condition tagged with the release of
the hostages is that all cases against them would be withdrawn," he
said.
An armed group abducted two Danes and one Briton on February 16 at a
place near Rangamati, some 400 kilometers southeast to Dhaka, demanding
a ransom of 1.66 million U.S. dollars.
