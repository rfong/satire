Britain, Sinn Fein in Bid to Break Impasse in Ulster 
The British government and the Sinn Fein party held talks in Belfast
today, in an attempt to break the impasse in the peace process in
Northern Ireland which has lasted for more than four months.
According to reports from the capital of the conflict-torn province,
Britain's Minister for political development in Northern Ireland Office
Michael Ancram had a 90-minute discussion with Martin McGuinness,
strategist of Sinn Fein, political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA).
Sinn Fein said that it had made to the British government "firm
proposals" which, they believed, could break the current deadlock.
Britain's Northern Ireland Office only said that today's discussion was
a continuation of talks between the two sides and further talks were
planned.
As the Irish Times disclosed that Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
would contact his British counterpart John Major within "the next
couple of days" to discuss the progress in the peace process.
The two prime ministers would chart the course of work for the
officials of the two countries on the establishment of a international
commission to oversee decommissioning of the arms of the IRA and
Protestant paramilitaries.
Bruton told the Irish Parliament two days ago that the Irish and
British governments were now engaged in a "twin-track" approach.
And the immediate aim of such an approach was to set up an
international body to monitor the decommissioning of arms and get all
parties concerned into either bilateral or trilateral talks with the
Irish and British governments on setting the agenda of all-party talks
on the political future of Northern Ireland.
But Bruton and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring both expressed
cautious optimism that the impasse in the peace process in Ulster could
be broken before the end of November, when U.S. President Bill Clinton
planned to visit Ireland and Britain.
