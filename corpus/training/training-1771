Massud Rajavi, president of the opposition Iranian National Resistance
Council, said he welcomed the Bundestag decision as "sign of clear
opposition by the German people to relations between (the late
Ayatollah) Khomeini's regime and Bonn."
"The participation of a criminal terrorist in the conference on Islam
is not only against the supreme interests of the Iranian people, but
also represents an insult to the entire Moslem world," the Iraq-based
opposition leader said in a statement to AFP in Paris.
