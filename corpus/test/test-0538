China Builds World's Largest Chlorinated Polyethylene Center 
China is building a chlorinated polyethylene project with an annual
production of 10,000 tons in Shandong province, east China.
When put into production early next year, the project will increase the
annual production capacity of the Yaxing Chemical Group in Weifang to
25,000 tons, accounting for a third of the world's total.
The group by then will export 20 million US dollars' worth of its
products annually.
Thanks to imported technology from Germany, the company produced 7,200
tons of polyethylene in 1990, becoming the largest producer of
polyethylene in Asia.
It became the world's second largest chlorinated polyethylene producer
in 1995, when it bought a German chlorinated polyethylene company and
its patent.
The company plans to increase annual sales to three billion yuan and
exports to 30 million U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
