Angola Takes Measures To Avoid Another War 
United Nations Special Envoy for Angola Blondin Beye has said that the
Angolan Peace Process Joint Committee would make every possible effort
to avoid another war in the country.
According to the local newspaper 'Angola Daily' today, Beye made the
remarks at a press conference here on thursday after the 11th meeting
of the Joint Committee.
He said that among the measures the Joint Committee would take is to
establish a committee of officers from the Angolan government, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), as well as
the military observers of the U.N. Verification Mission in Angola.
The new committee would monitor in 59 districts throughout the country
the withdrawal of the troops of the two warring sides, he said.
He revealed that the UNITA has begun to withdraw its troops from Uige
Province, northern Angola, since Thursday, adding that UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi has agreed to support all the decision of the committee.
