In/IN December/NNP 1988/CD ,/, as/IN Emperor/NNP Hirohito/NNP lay/VBD dying/VBG ,/, Motoshima/NNP broke/VBD Japan/NNP 's/POS greatest/JJS taboo/NN by/IN declaring/VBG in/IN public/NN that/IN he/PRP thought/VBD the/DT emperor/NN bore/VBD some/DT responsibility/NN for/IN World/NNP War/NNP II/NNP ./.

``/`` They/PRP said/VBD peace/NN wo/MD n't/RB buy/VB you/PRP a/DT meal/NN ,/, ''/'' Motoshima/NNP said/VBD ruefully/RB of/IN the/DT voters/NNS ./.
