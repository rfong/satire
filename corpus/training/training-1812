Trade in Narcotics Flourishes in Nairobi 
The narcotics trade is rampant and abuse of narcotics are becoming
wide-spread in some parts of the capital city of Nairobi, the Daily
Nation reported today.
The daily newspaper which has done extensive investigations said that
the abuse of cocaine, heroin and bhang/marijuana had infiltrated
schools and universities and about 40 percent of students are on drugs.
The mafia-type drug syndicate is co-ordinated by barons based in
low-class hotels and brothels in the city center, it pointed out.
Drug dealers secretly smuggle and traffick in drugs mostly from the
port city of Mombasa as the Anti-Narcotics Unit has taken stringent
measures at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi.
In Nairobi, heroin is easier available than cocaine since the former is
easily trafficked from India and Pakistan while the latter is sourced
from far-away South America.
Residents are quoted as saying that drug dealers are influential
individuals who operate under the police protection.
The paper quoted Head of Anti-Narcotics Unit Michael Jackoham as
confirming the activities of the drug syndicate.
He said, "the drug problem in Kenya, especially in urban centers, is
serious and should be addressed now."
