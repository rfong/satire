Asprilla Set for FA Showdown 
Faustino Asprilla and Keith Curle will face the Football Association
(FA) disciplinary committee on April 30 over a series of bruising
clashes watched by millions on television.
Newcastle's controversial Colombian striker and the Manchester City
skipper were involved in a running battle during the Premiership clash
between the clubs on February 24.
Soon after half-time Asprilla, angered by being hauled back as he tried
to break into the City area, lashed out with his elbow, catching Curle
in the face.
The City player went down, although referee Martin Bodenham took no
action and the South American subsequently scored his first goal in
English football in what became a thrilling 3-3 draw.
But the controversy did not end there. After the final whistle, the
pair clashed again, just yards from a linesman, with Asprilla appearing
to butt Curle, the referee again taking no action.
Both Newcastle boss Kevin Keegan and City manager Alan Ball said they
had not had a clear view of either incident but television footage was
graphic.
Within two hours of the match, the FA had launched an inquiry and
Asprilla was later charged with two counts of misconduct and Curle one.
Whatever the outcome -- and history suggests a lengthy ban is likely
for Asprilla -- there is little chance that either player will miss any
games this season.
Relegation-haunted City play their final fixture at home to Liverpool
five days later, while the Magpies face two games that week, at
Nottingham Forest on May 2 then home to Spurs on May 5.
But both clubs have a 14-day right of appeal against any punishments
imposed by the hearing and should those be claimed it would mean any
suspensions would come into effect at the beginning of next season.
