(BC-SCOTUS-93-1340 CONCUR UNITED STATES v. ME)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
No. 93-1340
UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v.
GARY MEZZANATTO
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT
(January 18, 1995)
JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR and JUSTICE BREYER join,
concurring.
The Court holds that a waiver allowing the Government to impeach with
statements made during plea negotiations is compatible with Congress's
intent to promote plea bargaining. It may be, however, that a waiver to
use such statements in the case-in-chief would more severely undermine
a defendant's incentive to negotiate, and thereby inhibit plea
bargaining. As the Government has not sought such a waiver, we do not
here explore this question.
