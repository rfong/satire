Thai share prices gain 1.4 percent 
Thai share prices gained 1.4 percent Tuesday with bargain-hunting in
banking, finance and communication stocks following recent sharp
losses, analysts said.
An analyst with CMIC Finance and Securities said the index closed in
positive territory due to gains in banks, financial and communications
sectors.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) broad-based index was up 8.06
points at 600.24 points, while the SET-50 select index advanced 1.06
points to 44.30 points.
The analyst said it was a technical rebound as there was no change in
fundamentals, adding that the possibility of a cut in domestic interest
rates remained.
A total of 131.5 million shares worth 4.16 billion (160 million
dollars) changed hands as advancing issues outnumbered those declining
192 to 130 and 73 stocks were unchanged.
Dealers said trading was volatile as profit-taking was offset by
short-term speculative buying, largely in financial sector blue chip
shares and warrants.
Wall Street Finance and Securities Issarapol Kunsorn said buying
interest in banking and financial sectors led to reports that the Bank
of Thailand would finalize the definition of sub-standard loans for
finance companies while possibly relaxing provisions in some other
areas.
The banking sector index was up 8.57 points at 640.90, the financial
sector rose 75.02 points to 2,393.48 and the communication sector index
advanced 1.62 points to 54,28.
