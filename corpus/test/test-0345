Rabin Nominates Two New Ministers, Sparking Fresh Crisis 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin filled two long-vacant Cabinet positions
Tuesday and set off a government crisis when his junior coalition
partner threatened to vote against the appointments.
The liberal Meretz party complained that the two posts went to members
of Rabin's ruling Labor Party and that Meretz was being ignored.
``We are partners in the coalition and since we aren't being properly
represented we cannot support these appointments,'' said Environment
Protection Minister Yossi Sarid of Meretz.
Sarid said Meretz legislators would meet later Tuesday to decide
whether to vote against the Cabinet appointments.
Without the vote of Meretz' 12 legislators, Rabin would only have the
support of 51 lawmakers in the 120-seat Parliament and would be unable
to get the Cabinet appointments approved.
Losing the Parliament vote would be a serious loss of face for Rabin's
already troubled coalition.
Rabin convened a special Cabinet session Tuesday to fill the posts of
religious affairs and interior minister. The posts had been kept vacant
in hopes of coaxing the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, a one-time coalition
member, back into the fold.
Earlier this month, Shas announced it would join the opposition. Shas
objects to Israel's peacemaking with the PLO and has frequently clashed
with Meretz, an advocate of secular rights.
Rabin appointed Tourism Minister Uzi Baram to head the Interior
Ministry and Economics Minister Shimon Shetreet was given the Religious
Affairs portfolio. Baram and Shetreet will also keep their original
posts.
Meretz has four ministers in the 18-member Cabinet.
