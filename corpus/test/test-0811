Two ancient trees save Chinese village from floods: report 
Two ancient trees saved a village in eastern China's Jiangxi province
from the worst floods to hit the area in 10 years in early June, a
report said Wednesday.
Two 400-year-old sandalwood trees in Chengqian village provided
early-warning clues to villagers of impending floods. The tree on the
east grew no leaves during the spring, while the one on the west
flourished, the semi-official China News Service said.
The villagers were apparently able to interpret these signs as a
portent of disaster, and took anti-flood precautionary measures that
saved them from great losses.
China's southern, eastern and northeastern provinces have been hit by
floods throughout this summer, which have so far killed some 2,000
people.
