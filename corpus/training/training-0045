No Interim Goverment Plan in Pakistan 
There is no plan to bring in a new set-up like interim political or
national government under a new prime minister in Pakistan.
This was said by Major General Rashid Qureshi, Press Secretary to the
President and Director General of Inter Services Public Relations, here
on Sunday.
"There is no such a plan and there has been no contemplation on the
lines of interim government or appointing a prime minister," Qureshi
told local journalists.
He said the government has given a roadmap for restoration of democracy
and holding of elections and steps are being taken for implementation
of this roadmap.
