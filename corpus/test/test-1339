Race for Leadership Remains Deadlocked 
Former Italian Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero is the clear leader in
the three-way race to head the fledgling World Trade Organization,
according to the first official figures published Wednesday.
The WTO said Ruggiero out of replies from 116 delegations, Ruggiero had
support from 57 countries. Former South Korean Trade Minister Kim
Chulsu trailed with 29, with former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari on 28. Two delegations did not list a preference.
Under WTO rules, any choice has to be made by consensus rather than by
a vote. This means that Ruggiero can only become director-general if no
one opposes him.
The United States and Latin American countries are firmly behind
Salinas. Japan and other Asian nations are pushing Kim, while Europe
and former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean want Ruggiero.
Ruggiero has been the clear favorite for months, but there are no signs
of a solution to the regional deadlock.
One solution is that all three candidates be persuaded to drop out, to
allow a fourth compromise choice to move in. However, this is likely to
be unacceptable to the Europeans.
An increasingly likely scenario is that Peter Sutherland, who headed
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and is now caretaker head of
the successor WTO, will agree to stay on beyond his March 15 term.
The WTO was set up on Jan. 1. It is meant to oversee a massive trade
liberalizing agreement which entered into force at the same time, but
has so far achieved very little.
