Paris mayor's wife plagiarised report: newspaper 
Xaviere Tiberi, wife of Gaullist mayor of Paris Jean Tiberi, committed
plagiary when she wrote a 36-page report for which she was paid 200,000
francs (40,000 dollars) of taxpayers' money, the centre-left daily
Liberation alleged on Friday.
Xaviere Tiberi faces indictment on corruption charges in connection
with the report.
Liberation published an extract of the report alongside a page of a
1989 study entitled "Decentralised development aid and multilateral
cooperation in the French-speaking world" and pointed out that some
passages had been copied word-for-word.
The newspaper said Tiberi had "scrupulously" followed the plan of the
author of the study, Daniel Meyer, director of the Champagne-Ardennes
Regional Institute for Develoment-Cooperation (IRCOD) and had "lifted
some sentences here and there and added some errors."
Public prosecutors at Evry, south of Paris, have ordered a judicial
probe against Xaviere Tiberi and "other persons" which, under French
law, means she will be automatically indicted with embezzling public
funds, fraud and receiving money in connection with the report. It was
commissioned in 1994 by Xavier Dugoin, Gaullist president of the
Essonne department council, south of the capital.
On Thursday Jean Tiberi expressed full support for his wife, saying the
sole purpose of the procedure against her was to "destabilise me" but
that it would only serve "to strengthen my political determination."
The probe will determine whether the Paris mayor's wife actually did
any work in writing the report whose subject was development aid and
cooperation in the French-speaking world. Tiberi received 10 monthly
payments of 20,000 francs for the report between March and December
1994.
Dugoin is already under investigation for alleged fictitious salaries
paid to his wife when she was a member of his staff.
The Tiberi report was found by anti-corruption judge Eric Halphen when
he searched the Tiberis' Paris apartment in June as part of his
investigations into kickbacks allegedly paid to the ruling Gaullist
Rally for the Republic (RPR) party for city housing maintenance
contracts. Halphen passed on the report to public prosecutors.
The indictment will be a new blow for the mayor of Paris who came in
for criticism when the investigative weekly Canard Enchaine revealed
that Tiberi had allocated city-owned apartments to his son and daughter
at below-market rents, enabling them to let out flats they owned in the
capital.
Authorities have twice cleared the mayor of accusations of conflict of
interest in the case of his children's apartments.
