Japan told to join EAEC first and leave later if unconvinced 
Malaysia has urged Japan to join the proposed East Asian Economic
Caucus (EAEC) to first understand its concept and then opt out later if
unconvinced of its benefits.
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi was quoted Monday as saying
that Japan would understand then that the EAEC did not oppose any
country, including the United States.
It would also realise that the caucus was not meant to counter any
trade bloc or the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, of
which the United States is a member.
"It is better for Japan to join the EAEC first, look at how it operates
and what it can achieve. If they are not satisfied, they can leave
later... it is a question of tasting the pudding," Abdullah was quoted
in local newspapers as saying.
His remarks, which came after Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
promised during a three-day visit here Sunday to "seriously consider
further" the EAEC, signalled Malaysia's growing impatience with Japan's
continued indecision to back the caucus.
Officials here admitted that the EAEC, initiated by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad in December 1990, could not materialise
without Asia's economic powerhouse.
Tokyo's participation is widely known to have been deterred by US
opposition to the EAEC idea, on grounds it was exclusionary and a
budding trade bloc.
Murayama, who became prime minister in June, promised a serious
re-examination to back the Malaysian plan but also indicated he was not
about ready to defy Washington by joining the EAEC.
EAEC proponents come mainly from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, which groups Malaysia with Brunei, the Philippines, Indonesia,
Singapore and Thailand. They have voiced a commitment to an open,
multilateral trading system.
