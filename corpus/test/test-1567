New Zealand Names Davis Cup Team 
New Zealand's Davis Cup captain Glen Wilson named four players on
Wednesday for a game against Thailand in February with newcomer James
Shorthall heading the field.
Mark Nielsen, Alistair Hunt and James Greenhalgh were also named in the
squad for the Asia-Oceania group one match from February 4-6.
The Thai team includes Paradon Srichapan, ranked 106th in the world and
an impressive performer at last week's Hopman Cup in Perth where
Thailand was beaten in the final by South Africa.
