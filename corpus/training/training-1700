World Bank applauds US, European aid initiatives 
The World Bank on Thursday welcomed US and European Union initiatives
to increase aid for developing countries.
"We applaud the president for his statement on the importance of
increasing development assistance," World Bank president James
Wolfensohn said, after US President George W. Bush announced he would
raise US aid to developing countries by five billion dollars over the
next three fiscal years.
"We look forward to working closely with the (US) administration in
pursuing our joint goal of fighting poverty and building long-term
peace," Wolfensohn said.
The 15 member EU countries, meeting in Barcelona, Spain, also agreed
Thursday to increase their foreign aid contributions by setting a
common rate of international aid donation.
"We also very much welcome the EU's decision to boost the average
annual aid spending of their member states to 0.39 percent of GDP by
2006. These are both important steps in the fight against poverty," he
added.
