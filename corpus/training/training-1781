Joint leader Riley goes into the third round of the Scottish Open at
Carnoustie on Friday insisting that if he fails to win on Saturday it
won't be because he has been involved in some wild party.
The 32-year-old from Sydney, tied with Montgomerie on nine under par,
said: "For my first seven years on the European tour I came over and
had a party. To hide that would be stupid.
"I'm very happy I had a good time because a lot of guys don't. How I
never lost my card I don't know.
"But now I have two children and do the things that other boring
golfers do. I still go to parties, but not as often -- and certainly
not in the middle of a tournament. I've done that before.
"I should have won before now, but it will happen and once it does I'll
be off," added the man known as the Wild Colonial Cowboy.
