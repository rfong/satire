Bangladeshi Tanker Blast Attributed to Monitoring Failure 
Absence of proper monitoring system in the private ship-breaking yards
and inadequate precautionary measures by the buyers of abandoned ships
have led to the explosion of an oil tanker on Wednesday in Chittagong,
The Daily Star reported here Friday.
The casualty figure caused by the explosion rose to 18 from 16 when two
more workers succumbed to their burn injuries at Chittagong Medical
College Hospital early Thursday morning.
Police and other sources said lapses in precautionary measures,
including making the ship chamber gas-free before scrapping, triggered
the blast and other accidents at ship-breaking yards.
Standard procedure requires a ship to be free of gas before breaking,
but it is hardly followed at ship-breaking grounds. Sources said
ship-breakers sometimes obtain gas-free certificates from the
government's explosive department in collusion with a section of
customs officials.
Meanwhile, negligence as well as gross violation of rules and
regulations of the concerned government departments by the operators of
the yards are rampant.
At least 50 workers had been killed in 30 such blasts in the
ship-breaking yards of the district during the last two decades, a
survey conducted by The Independent newspaper revealed.
Industry sources said that over 40,000 workers are directly engaged in
the ship-breaking industry while over 1 million people are indirectly
dependent on it.
The ship-breaking industry has an annual turnover of about 5 billion
taka (96 million U.S. dollars), they said.
