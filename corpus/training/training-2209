Colombian Mayor Assassinated 
Fernando Botero Jaramillo, mayor of the Colombian municipality of
Sevilla, was assassinated in his jeep Wednesday.
The Mayor of Sevilla, a municipality in the northwest of the department
of Valle del Cauca, was ambushed Wednesday morning by several
unidentified gunmen when the mayor was travelling from his ranch in
Manzanillo to Sevilla.
These gunmen had been waiting for the mayor close to the highway, where
they shot at the jeep, killing all people in it.
The mayor's son, Luis Fernando Botero, who was driving the jeep, lost
his life in the attack. A policeman and two bodyguards were also
killed.
Afterwards, police detained four soldiers in Zarzal, a rural region on
the border between the departments of Valle del Cauca and Risaralda, as
they could not give a satisfactory explanation for being on the scene.
