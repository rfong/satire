POSCO 1996 net profit falls 25.7 percent to 726 million dollars 
South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Co. (POSCO) said Wednesday net
profit fell 25.7 percent year-on to 623.9 billion won (726 million
dollars) last year due to its price-cutting drive.
"POSCO slashed local steel prices seven times last year, as the
country's economic slump narrowed demand," said a spokesman of the
state-run company, whose local sales stood at 75 percent of the total.
Sales, however, increased to 8.45 trillion won last year from the
previous year's 8.22 trillion won, the spokesman said.
POSCO, the world's second largest steel mill, plans to expand annual
production capacity from 21 million tonnes to 28 million tonnes by 2005
to meet growing worldwide demand.
The company, established in 1968, accounted for 65.5 percent of South
Korea's steel output in 1994.
