Jordan repatriates embassy driver killed by gunmen (new series) 
Jordan on Wednesday repatriated the body of an embassy driver killed by
gunmen who stole his car and the diplomatic pouch he was taking to
Baghdad, the official Jordanian news agency, Petra, said.
The body of 40-year-old Omar Ahmad Ali Sobh, who was shot dead Monday
by three gunmen, was taken to a hospital at Irbid in northern Jordan
and will be buried Thursday in the village where he was born.
Jordan's ambassador to Iraq, Bassam Kakich, and embassy staff travelled
by car to the Jordanian border with the body, embassy personnel said.
Jordanian officials said the pouch that was stolen contained embassy
mail and more than 250 blank Jordanian passports.
Iraqi authorities are investigating the attack which occurred after the
car crossed into Iraq from Jordan. The ambassador said the diplomatic
car made the trip between Amman and Baghdad every two weeks with the
pouch.
Iraq's ambassador to Jordan, Nuri Ismail Luwais, condemned the attack
and blamed "one of the bands of outlaws which have cropped up in Iraq
because of the unjust UN embargo imposed on the country."
Since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, highway robbery has increased on
the Iraqi section of the 1,000 kilometer (600-mile) road between the
two capitals.
The highway is Iraq's only link to the outside world since UN sanctions
were imposed after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Iraq's ties with Jordan deteriorated last year after two of President
Saddam Hussein's sons-in-law defected to Amman. They later returned
home only to be killed by relatives seeking to restore family honor,
Iraqi officials said.
