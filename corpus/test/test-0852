China gives new warning on market opening measures 
The Chinese authorities said Tuesday that economic reforms would not be
speeded up just to meet the demands of foreign powers in the country's
fruitless GATT negotiations.
Qiu Xichun, a senior official at the foreign trade and economic
cooperation ministry, stressed that the reforms would be pursued, the
China Daily reported.
"China will continue its foreign trade reform and development according
to its own schedule," Qiu was quoted as saying.
"We have a lot on our plates in the coming years," he added.
Qiu highlighted the restructuration of the debt-ridden state sector
industry, the convertibility of the yuan, the opening up of Chinese
markets and the reduction of certain customs tariffs.
But, he insisted, progress on reforming foreign trade will continue at
a pace dictated by China, in line with international practices and the
needs of the country's so-called socialist market economy.
China has repeatedly condemned other nations for the failure of talks
this month in Geneva over its return to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. The breakdown prevented China from becoming a
founder member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which will take
over from GATT on January 1.
The United States and European Union have said China must give stronger
guarantees on its willingness to liberalise trade.
But China has replied that it has done everything possible and that
faster reforms could endanger the national economy and social order.
China was a founder member of GATT in 1947, but pulled out when the
communists took over in 1949. It requested re-admission in 1986 when
Deng Xiaoping's market reforms were started.
Talks on China joining the WTO could start early in 1995.
