Turkey Downs Canada 3-0 in Exhibition Match 
Players from Canada's national soccer team were left in disbelief at a
superb goal from Sergen Yalcin that started Turkey on the way to a 3-0
exhibition victory on Wednesday afternoon.
``That was a world class goal,'' said Canadian midfielder Kevin
Holness. `You might see one in 100 like that.''
Yalcin's goal off a corner kick from veteran Tugay Kerimoglu in the
68th minute opened the scoring after Canada had matched chances equally
with the gifted young Turks.
Yalcin was open, 25 meters in front of the Canadian goal, when he swung
around and hit a left-foot volley to the top corner that left
goalkeeper Paul Dolan helpless.
The Canadians went on the offensive and the Turks forced tuurnovers and
scored twice more on counterattacks _ from Ogun Temizkanoglu in the
86th minute and Hami Mandirali in the 90th.
Turkey had overpowered Canada in a 3-1 victory in Toronto on Sunday,
but until Yalcin's goal, it was a closer match in the 30 C heat at
Centre Claude-Robillard in Montreal.
Geoff Aunger just missed the left post with a blast from 22 meters out
in the 36th minute and Carlo Corazzin headed a Marco Rizi pass just
over the bar in the two best scoring chances of the first half.
Tomasz Radzinski, who replaced Niall Thompson at half time, hit the
goalpost with a header only five minutes into the second half.
Canada was without two of its best strikers _ Paul Pescesolido, who was
tied up with Stoke City in England, and Alex Bunbury, currently
occupied with Maritimo in Portugal.
The Turks had made four substitutions at half time and came out
stronger, led by the fresh legs of Temizkanoglu and Yalcin.
It was a shot off the bar from Temizkanoglu that led to the corner kick
that was converted by Yalcin.
Temizkanoglu then roared down the left side and put a shot inside the
near post. With the match going into injury time, Mandirali scored from
in close.
A crowd announced at 2,602, most wearing the Turkish red and white
crescent and star, cheered on the visitors, who are on a six-game
friendly tour of North and South America.
The Turks are also to play in Peru, Honduras and Chile before returning
home to continue European Nations Cup qualifying. The Turks currently
are tied with Switzerland atop the Group 3 qualifying pool.
Turkey used several young players against Canada to give them
international experience with a view towards the next World Cup in
1998.
