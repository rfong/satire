Howard Insists on Reconciliation in practice with Aboriginals 
Australian Prime Minister John Howard insists on his "reconciliation in
practice" with Aboriginals, the Australian Associated Press reported
Friday.
The prime minister defended his refusal to apologize to those forcibly
separated from their aboriginal parents, now called "the stolen
generation."
He was in response to an accusation made by the former prime minister
Malcolm Fraser Thursday night.
The former Liberal leader criticized the government for fighting the
stolen generation in the courts, refusing to say " sorry" and rejecting
United Nations criticisms in his delivery of the annual Vincent
Lingiari memorial lecture.
In addition, he urged Australia to adopt a bill of rights, saying
common law had failed to protect the rights of around 40, 000
Aboriginals in the country.
Howard confronted the accusation by saying that "If reconciliation was
as simple as substituting one word for another, it would have been done
years ago."
"The best way of helping disadvantaged people now is to address
elements of disadvantage," he said, adding "we are increasingly doing
that."
However, Fraser' remarks were welcomed by Aboriginal leaders. Head of
the Council for the Aboriginal Reconciliation Evelyn Scott said
Thursday night: "I was most impressed, I thought it was a brilliant
speech."
"The things he spoke about like the bill of rights, I was a bit
surprised by it but I fully endorse what he was saying," she said.
