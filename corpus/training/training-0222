According to Boris Becker, the top 10 in men's tennis may soon
symbolize not only success on the court but also political power off
it.
``We don't have a proper voice in the ATP,'' Becker said Friday at a
Manhattan news conference for Lotto, the sporting goods firm whose
shoes and clothes he endorses. ``We need to be more dominant, more
strong.''
Becker said the top players competing in New Haven, Conn., last week
discussed how they were being affected by recent changes, shortening
the time between points and playing music during change-overs.
``Where are we going if every month rules are going to change?'' said
Becker, ranked No. 7 after winning two tournaments this summer.
Even if more radical changes are permitted, the 26-year-old Becker said
he wants to play tennis until he's about 30. And he no longer is
worried about being labeled a jock.
``There were times when I didn't accept I was only a tennis player,''
he said. ``That has changed. I don't need to prove myself.''
He dreams of another profession for his 7-month-old son, Noah: ``I
would prefer to see him on the basketball court, a power forward.''
