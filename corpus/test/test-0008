Bosnian army Fifth Corps training reported in Bihac 
The Bosnian army's Fifth Corps was likely responsible for the estimated
300 detonations, gun and shellfire, heard on Friday, a UN official said
here.
The Bihac news agency had reported that Bosnian Serb forces fired more
than 600 shells at mainly Moslem government forces in the former
enclave in northwest Bosnia.
A UN spokesman in Zagreb confirmed that more than 300 explosions were
heard in the pocket, including just one inside the UN-declared safe
area comprising Bihac town and its surrounding villages, early Friday.
But a UN official in Sarajevo said that the detonations were likely
caused by training by the Fifth Corps.
Bihac was surrounded on all sides by besieging Croatian and Bosnian
Serbs for over three years until early last month when the lightning
Croatian offensive through the Krajina region opened up the pocket's
western and northern flanks.
Bosnian Serb forces had shelled the region Wednesday when some 600
explosions were heard in the area, the United Nations said, including
four in the safe area.
