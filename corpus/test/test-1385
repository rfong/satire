Indian Cabinet Minister Quits 
A senior minister quit India's Cabinet on Saturday and challenged Prime
Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's leadership over his handling of alleged
corruption cases.
The resignation of Human Resources Minister Arjun Singh, a longtime
critic of Rao, deepened the crisis in the governing party as it heads
into crucial state elections in February and a general election in
early 1996.
If Congress fares badly in the five state elections, Rao is likely to
lose whatever support he retains in the party, leaving Singh in a
position to unseat him.
Singh, a persistent critic of the government's three-year-old free
market reforms, reiterated Saturday that India's economic policies
should be ``more responsive to the people,'' especially the poor.
At a news conference, Singh said he was quitting because he ``could not
remain unaffected'' by the allegations of corruption. He sent a
seven-page resignation letter to Rao demanding independent inquiries
into the scandals that have rocked the government for two years.
He also demanded a change in the party's leadership, but he denied he
was seeking the top government post.
Singh was the fifth minister to quit the Cabinet in two weeks. Three of
the ministers, who were implicated in the scandals, resigned at Rao's
request on Thursday in an effort to stave off the crisis.
Singh urged Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of assassinated Indian
leader Rajiv Gandhi, to enter politics and provide the charismatic
leadership that Rao lacked.
``At the moment we don't have a charismatic leader,'' Singh told a
crowd of more than 200 reporters at his house.
Mrs. Gandhi turned down an offer to become president of the party
immediately after her husband was killed. She exercises considerable
behind-the-scenes influence but does not speak on political issues in
public.
Rao's leadership came under serious question when the party lost two
key state elections in southern India last month, including a crushing
defeat in his home state of Andhra Pradesh.
At the same time, a scandal came to a head over the failure to import
enough sugar last year, leading to a doubling of prices. The food
minister was accused by the opposition of delaying imports to benefit
private traders.
Rao sacked two other ministers who had been criticized in a
parliamentary investigation into the dlrs 1.7 billion securities
scandal in 1991.
Congress Party officials described Singh's move as ``irresponsible.''
Lawmakers from the party held a meeting to assure Rao of their support.
A resolution passed at the meeting said: ``It is reprehensible that a
senior leader ... should choose to attack the leadership and try to
disrupt the party.''
