Wilkins wants Hateley to switch Rangers 
Queen's Park Rangers manager Ray Wilkins said Friday that he wants to
sign former England striker Mark Hateley from Scottish champions
Rangers.
"I've made an inquiry to Rangers about Mark Hateley," said Wilkins, who
may be prepared to pay one million pounds after selling Les Ferdinand
to Newcastle during the summer for six million.
"Like many other people, I want him as he is a first class striker. I'm
now waiting for an answer from Rangers."
Hateley, who will be 34 in November, has scored more than 100 goals
during his five-year career at Ibrox.
But Rangers assistant manager Archie Knox said a sale was unlikely with
the Scots facing five more games in the European Champions League.
"Every club in the Champions League realises all the players you can
get are needed with the programme of games," he said. "You do not want
to deplete your squad at this time."
