Uganda Appeals for Urgent Food Aid to Famine-Hit Region 
Ugandan Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe on Monday called for emergency
food aid to the famine-hit Karamoja region in northeastern Uganda,
Radio Uganda reported.
Kazibwe made the appeal when she chaired a meeting on tackling the
starvation in a more effective and sustained manner. The meeting was
attended by ministers, districts officials and representatives of
non-government organizations from the Karamoja region.
Some 115 people in Karamoja had died of hunger since June, and the
World Food Program (WFP) emergency operation in Karamoja has increased
relief rations.
The food has been airlifted or ferried by trucks to Kakingol and Tapac
parishes in the region, the worst hit areas by the drought.
Kazibwe and Minister of Disaster Preparedness Tom Butime made an
impromptu visit to assess the famine situation in the region last
Wednesday following press reports that people died of starvation.
Some 30 out of 45 districts of Uganda have reportedly been affected by
the drought, and the people in some areas have faced severe
food-shortage.
