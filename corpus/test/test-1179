Kuwaiti Petroleum Group to Provide Oil To Zimbabwe 
The Independent Petroleum Group (IPG) of Kuwait and the National Oil
Company of Zimbabwe (Noczim) signed a long-term deal on Friday in
Harare to provide fuel supplies to Zimbabwe to ease the months long oil
shortage in the southern African country.
The agreement comes about two weeks after Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe's visit to Kuwait.
The agreement was signed by Noczim board member Bobby Kambarami and IPG
Finance Manager R. Kesavan following a directive to Noczim from
President Mugabe on Thursday to have the negotiations concluded
urgently.
The long-term deal, whose total value is still being worked out,
includes upgrading of the pipeline to increase its capacity from the
current 1.2 million tons a year, consultant work to see how Noczim can
be reformed and revamped and restoration of the national strategic
reserves.
Zimbabwe consumes 1.8 million tons every year and the balance of about
600,000 tons has to be brought in by road and rail.
Kesavan said with the upgrading of the pipeline and storage facilities,
IPG will be able to increase the capacity to meet the daily
consumption.
Kambarami said the signing of the agreement would resolve the fuel
crisis, but people should not expect the situation to nomalize in a
week.
