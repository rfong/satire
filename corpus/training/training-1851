Eighth Glasgow terror attack arrest: cops hold 'top IRA man'
Police in Paisley, Scotland have said they have arrested a "top IRA man" in
connection with the car bomb attempt to blow up Glasgow Airport.
The news comes as Anti-Terror top brass said a treasure trove of clues
had led them to Paisley "which is the same name as the Reverend Ian
Paisley, top Northern Irish loyalist bomber of the 1970s and 80s".
No ID details have been released officially although informal reports
say the man, in his fifties, may be delusional and calling himself a
top former international politician involved in the Global Piss
Process.
Other intelligence sources say that the suspect first claimed immunity
from prosecution and when that didn't work offered the arresting
officers Life Peerages in the House of Lords.
"We can't say more at the moment except that the suspect is clearly
bonkers and may have been up to no good for the last ten years."
Lord Levy is 69.
