Private Sector Encouraged to Absorb Laid-off Workers 
The Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau has adopted a policy to encourage
the private sector to absorb more laid-off workers.
The policy stipulates that private enterprises can enjoy tax breaks or
preferential loans if laid-off workers account for more than 60 percent
of their work force.
Subsidies are also available for enterprises which absorb laid-off
workers. For example, enterprises can receive subsidies of 4,000-6,000
yuan per middle-aged laid-off worker employeed for more than two years.
"The private sector has played an important role in absorbing laid-off
workers, and more preferential policies will be formulated to encourage
the trend," according to You Lantian, director of the Municipal Labor
Bureau.
Statistics show the city's private sector absorbed more than 11,000
laid-off workers during 1997.
