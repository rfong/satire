Mothers Win Release of Six Russian Captives Held By Chechens 
A group of mothers who had traveled to the besieged Chechen capital to
seek news of their soldier sons said Friday they had won the release of
six Russian prisoners of war.
The young soldiers were evacuated Thursday night after Chechen fighters
had led the women from buildings where they had sought shelter from
heavy shelling deep into Grozny, where they had gone to pick up the
captives.
Some of the women described the Russian bombardment as terrifying.
Several said they were convinced the Russian soldiers had been ordered
to fire on them.
``Russian soldiers bombed Russian mothers,'' said one, Vera Ivanova,
who still has no word on her 20-year-old son's fate.
Three of the mothers, all nurses, stayed behind to treat the wounded in
Grozny, the women said.
The fate of Russian captives is one of many issues that a delegation
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
plans to examine during a trip to Chechnya that began Friday.
Rene Nyberg, a Finnish member of the delegation, said the group's
mission was humanitarian.
``Our most important and urgent duty is to give the support we can to
the Red Cross and other humanitarian groups so they can function in the
war zone,'' Nyberg said in Moscow before leaving for the Caucasus.
Delegation leader Istvan Gyarmati of Hungary said the group did not
plan to mediate the crisis, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
In Moscow, a radio station reported that Chechen leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev was seeking to make contact with Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin in an attempt to end the fighting.
The Echo Moscow radio station quoted Dudayev aide Movladi Udugov as
saying Chernomyrdin was the most reasonable figure in the Russian
government.
Previous attempts to hold talks to end the fighting have failed.
On Thursday, one of the day's strongest aerial bombardments targeted
the southern fringe of Grozny. But as the war in the separatist
republic neared the six-week mark, Chechen rebels' defiance remained
high.
The Russians also shelled and rocketed surrounding villages, igniting a
huge fire in an oil storage terminal in a refinery district a few
kilometers (miles) south of the Chechen capital.
One airstrike proved to be on their own troops.
Moscow news agencies reported that Russian aircraft mistook a Russian
border guard post near the village of Alkun in Ingushetia for a Chechen
militants' stronghold, delivering a missile strike on it and wounding a
soldier.
A Russian spokesman confirmed later that the post had been attacked,
but claimed the plane responsible for it was unidentified. The Chechen
fighters have no planes.
Chechen officials said their fighters had pushed Russian troops out of
some positions in the center of Grozny and retaken the railroad
station. They said their forces have the ammunition, strength and
fortified positions to defend the capital for a long time.
Thousands of people have been killed since Russia's offensive to put
down the southern region's self-declared independence began Dec. 11.
Russian guns are now pounding the last bits of the city, trying to
drive out the last of Grozny's determined Chechen defenders.
A prisoner exchange was worked out Thursday on the border of Dagestan
and Chechnya, where 34 of Moscow's soldiers were handed over in
exchange for 43 Chechens.
