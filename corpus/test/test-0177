Chinese Americans Protest Against NATO's Attack on Chinese Embassy 
A group of Chinese Americans, who drove a long way from Philadelphia,
rallied Sunday in front of the White House to protest against NATO's
brutal missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
"The Chinese Embassy is part of the Chinese territory. The brutal
bombing is an aggression of China's sovereignty," said a protester
named Wang, whose whole family came to join the protest.
"The Chinese people will not tolerate any aggression, we would never
bow to anybody," Wang said.
The protesters gathered at the Lafayette Park near the White House. A
woman held a five-star red flag and all the protesters raised posters
or signs that read: "Justice For The Innocent!" "We Love Peace!" and
"Turn In The Murderer!"
"We come here to express our anger at the killers," said a demonstrator
named He. "The U.S. leaders always claim they safeguard human rights,
now where are the human rights of the Chinese people? why did they kill
the Chinese people? "
Three Chinese journalists were killed in the NATO air raid on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade late Friday. Over 20 others were injured.
The five-storey embassy building was hit by three NATO precision-guided
missiles from different angles.
NATO and the United States claimed that the Chinese Embassy was
targeted by mistake.
However, the Americans do not believe so. "I was born and grew up here,
I know our government, they are liars," Scafer Bailey, who also joined
the protest by the Chinese, told Xinhua.
"This is absolutely not an accident, we should formally apologize to
the Chinese," Bailey said, adding, "The Americans are committing war
crimes there, it's a big shame."
"NATO=North Atlantic Terrorist Organization" reads a sign raised by
Concepcion Picciotto, who has spent 18 years at the Lafayette Park to
protest against nuclear weapons and all wars.
Commenting on U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement on the bombing of
the Chinese Embassy, an American tour guide told Xinhua, "Clinton said
(Yugoslav leader Slobodan) Milosevic should be responsible. No, no way.
It is Clinton's fault."
