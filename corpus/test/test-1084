22,000 TB Cases Recorded in Malawi Annually 
Malawi has recorded 22,000 cases of tuberculosis (TB) annually since
1998, and the number is expected to hit 29, 000 by the year 2005, a
report reaching here said on Wednesday.
"Most of these cases will be young adults," said Malawi's TB program
manager Dr. Felix Salaniponi.
The situation is particularly worrying since TB has a long treatment
regime which means a lot of young people will be off work thereby
affecting the socio-economic development of the country.
Statistics from the Health Ministry of Malawi indicate that over 90
percent of TB cases in Malawian hospitals are also HIV positive.
The National AIDS Program of Malawi estimates nearly one million of the
country's 10 million population are HIV positive.
