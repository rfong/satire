Sarkozy auctions Louvre Pyramid - Hungary wins!
French President Nicolas Sarkozy (Sarko) has auctioned off the Louvre
Pyramid to the highest bidder, the Republic of Hungary.
"Everything must go," Sarko remarked. "It all reminds me of the way
things used to be around here. Don't worry - we will find another
entrance to the museum."
The next step is to figure out how to excavate and ship the behemoth.
In the meantime, plans are underway to round up as many gypsies as
possible to fit inside of the glass structure.
"Why not expel two birds with one stone?" he added.
