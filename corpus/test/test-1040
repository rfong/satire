Two Nepalese policemen,three Maoists killed in battle 
Five people were killed when 300 Maoists attacked a police post at
Bethan village in Ramechhap district, 150 kilometres (93 miles)
northeast of here, state-run news agency RSS reported Sunday.
A police sergeant and constable were killed, another policeman was
seriously wounded and one was missing, the report said.
Three Maoists, including a woman, were shot dead.
When the police ran out of ammunition after firing 200 rounds in the
one-hour battle, the attackers set the post ablaze and fled, RSS
reported.
Home Ministry secretary Padma Raj Pokhrel said 83 people had been
killed since the Maoists launched their "people's war" last February
seeking to replace kingdom of Nepal with a republic.
The main opposition Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist
(NCP-UML) party has said it was prepared to act as a mediator between
the government and Maoists.
