Shaanxi Offers Major Projects to Overseas Investors
These projects involve a combined investment of 38 billion yuan (4.5
billion U.S. dollars) covering the fields of transportation, energy,
environmental protection, agriculture, tourism, industry and commerce,
a provincial trade official said Friday.
Major projects included an expressway linking Huxian and Yangxian
counties which will cost 10.2 billion yuan, and construction of the
1.4-billion-yuan Dabaodang Coal Mine.
The forum, to be held September 4 to 6 in Xi'an, the provincial
capital, is expected to attract 300 to 500 Chinese and overseas
participants, including ranking government officials, business magnates
of the Fortune 500, diplomats, leaders of major Chinese enterprises and
economists.
Other major investment-seeking events to be held at the same time as
the forum include a fair for reinvestment by foreign- funded
enterprises in China and the Xi'an Investment and Trade Fair.
The first forum on developing China's western region was held in May
2000 in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province.
