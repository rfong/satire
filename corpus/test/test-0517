Zimbabwean Students Organization Condemns Violence
The Zimbabwe National Students Union Saturday said it does not support the
stance of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to topple the
government violently.
Information and Publicity Secretary of the union Machinda Marongwe said
in a statement that the students would not hesitate to resist any
anarchy that is aimed at removing a constitutionally elected
government.
He said: "We condemn violence in the strongest terms and we would be
grateful if the police clamped down on the MDC leader Morgan
Tsvangirai."
Tsvangirai recently told a gathering at MDC's first anniversary in
Harare that he would violently remove President Robert Mugabe from
office if he does not resign before the 2002 presidential elections.
Marongwe said, "Tsvangirai's call for violence shows that he is a
willing and convenient tool who is being used by the external forces to
destabilize the country."
He said by advocating for violence, Tsvangirai had shown that he was a
political amateur and that if the MDC was a democratic party it should
lead by example.
