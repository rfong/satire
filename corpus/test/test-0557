Squash's fight for Olympic inclusion 
Squash was still fighting to become an Olympic sport by the year 2000,
the president of the World Squash Federation (WSF) said on Sunday.
Malaysia's Tunku Imran, whose influence at the head of the WSF helped
squash into the Commonwealth Games in his home country in 1998, is
determined it should also be included in the Sydney Olympics.
Beach volleyball and softball are provisional sports for the 1996
Atlanta Games, and triathlon and taikwondo have the same status in the
2000 Games.
Imran is hopeful that squash, with 105 member nations and 15 million
players, will also join the Olympic movement at the turn of the
century.
"We are still trying hard to get Olympic recognition for squash," Imran
said.
