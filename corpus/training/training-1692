Libya, PLO to meet in New York to discuss expulsions 
The PLO and Libya will discuss in New York ways to end Tripoli's mass
expulsion of Palestinians, the PLO's representative to the Arab League,
Mohammad Sobeih, said here Wednesday.
The head of the PLO's political department, Faruq Kaddumi, is to meet
with Libyan Arab Unity Minister Jomaa al-Fezzani "in the coming days"
on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York,
Sobeih said.
"Kaddumi and Fezzani will continue their consultations, after their
meeting last week in Cairo outside the ministeral council of the Arab
League failed to achieve a result," Sobeih said.
According to Sobeih, the PLO were made aware of the "Libyans'
determination to continue the expulsion" of Palestinians residing in
their country.
Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi began throwing out the 30,000 Palestinians
in Libya four months ago but has stepped up the pace to show up what he
sees as the failure of the Israeli-PLO autonomy accords to create a
Palestinian homeland.
