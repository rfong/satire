Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen to visit Seoul 
Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen will make an official visit to
South Korea from July 14 to 17, the foreign ministry said Friday.
The visit, expected to be dominated by trade and investment issues, is
the first by a high-ranking Cambodian official since Seoul and Phnom
Penh severed ties in 1975, a ministry spokesman said.
Last May, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding to
restore diplomatic ties, but foreign ministry officials say the process
could be drawn out because of Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk's close
ties to North Korea.
During his stay here, Hun Sen will meet President Kim Young-Sam to
discuss bilateral issues and the political situation in the region, the
spokesman said.
He said Hun Sen's visit would help South Korean companies make inroads
into Cambodia and its neighboring countries.
Last year, South Korea's exports to Cambodia amounted to 25.87 million
dollars, while its imports from Cambodia stood at 3.44 million dollars.
Officials said Hun Sen would visit auto-making and a home appliances
plants during the trip.
