N.Korean defector declared dead after attack 
A North Korean defector gunned down by suspected Pyongyang agents on
February 15 was declared dead Tuesday with a bullet still in his head,
doctors said.
Lee Han-Young, 37, died at 09:02 p.m. (1202 GMT) at the Cha hospital
where he had remained brain-dead, a hospital official said.
"Doctors failed to bring him back to life after his heart stopped
beating earlier in the day," she said.
Lee, a nephew of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il's estranged live-in
girlfriend, was shot and critically wounded by two unidentified
assailants on February 15 in a Seoul apartment block, triggering a
nationwide manhunt.
Police initially linked the shooting to the asylum bid of top North
Korean party member Hwang Jang-Yop, who walked into the South Korean
consulate in Beijing on February 12.
Police said Pyongyang had enough reasons to hold a grudge against Lee
for writing a book with lewd stories about the North Korean leader.
The shooting followed Pyongyang's threat of retaliation for the flight
of Hwang, a 74-year-old top ideologue and senior party member, which
put the two Koreas in a tense standoff.
The prime suspect for the shooting was still North Korea, but police
later raised the possibility of retaliation by a Russian mafia gang or
businessmen who might have had debt problems with the defector.
Police said they would conduct an autopsy Wednesday to check whether
the bullet was Czech-made.
The role of Russian businessmen or the Russian mobsters could explain
the use of Czech bullets in the attack, they said.
Lee had often been involved in business with Russians since he quietly
defected in 1982.
