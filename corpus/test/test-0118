Five Indian soldiers, three militants killed in Kashmir 
Five Indian soldiers and three Moslem guerrillas were killed in a
fierce gunbattle in Kashmir on Saturday, the police said.
Five other soldiers were wounded in the fighting which erupted before
dawn when a band of militants attacked an isolated army camp near
Puneja village, some 190 kilometers (118 miles) from here, police
sources said.
Army reinforcements which rushed to the site also came under attack
from the guerrillas, the sources said in this winter capital of
Kashmir.
No further details were immediately available.
Puneja lies in the mountainous district of Doda, which has a mixed
population of Hindus and Moslems and where Moslem guerrillas
campaigning to end Indian rule over Kashmir are active.
More than 12,000 people have been killed since 1989 in the Kashmiri
secessionist campaign. India accuses Pakistan of arming the militants.
Pakistan denies the charge.
