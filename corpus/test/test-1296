Chad group disclaims responsibility for hostages' safety 
A Chadian armed opposition group disclaimed responsibility Saturday for
the safety of four hostages, including an American, whom it is holding
if it continued to come under attack from government forces.
The Movement for Democracy and Development (MDD) said that the forces
of Chadian President Idris Deby has since Wednesday launched repeated
attacks on the Lake Chad region in a bid to rescue the hostages.
A copy of the MDD statement was faxed to AFP here from Kano, a northern
Nigerian city.
In Washington Thursday, the State Department demanded the immediate
release of the US hostage, UN Development Program technical consultant
Anthony Johnson.
MDD spokesman Moussa Abakar told AFP Saturday that the four hostages
were "in good health," adding that a member of the organisation had
collected drugs for Johnson, who is a diabetic, from the US embassy in
Lagos Friday.
There was no immediate confirmation of this from the embassy.
State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelley said Thursday that
Johnson, 43, required daily medical attention, and that his life was in
danger if he was not released.
The MDD said it abducted Johnson, two Chadians and a Malian a week ago
to demonstrate that Chad's government could not ensure security in the
country.
It claimed Saturday that 100 government forces had died during the
clashes to free the four, while five MDD fighters had perished.
