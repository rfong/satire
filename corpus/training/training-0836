Suspected Haitian coup plotter jailed in Ecuador 
Former Haitian police commissioner Guy Philippe was being held in an
Ecuadoran jail Thursday, after Haitian officials accused him of
masterminding an attempted coup earlier this week, police said.
Philippe was detained by immigration police at Quito airport's
in-transit area as he attempted to enter Ecuador on a flight from
Panama.
Ecuador's deputy foreign minister Jaime Marchan told reporters Philippe
would be deported in the next few hours, without specifying to which
country.
Ecuador earlier denied asylum to Haiti's ex-police chief.
Officials in Port-au-Prince accuse Philippe of being the intellectual
author of Monday's attempted coup against President Jean Bertrand
Aristide.
Philippe defended his innocence by pointing to his absence from Haiti
as the coup attempt was launched.
