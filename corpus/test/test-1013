Japanese Politics In Turmoil 
The political earthquake last year that ended nearly four decades of
one-party rule here had settled in recent months into quiet maneuvering
over who would control the slow reconstruction of Japan's political
order and how much the economy would be opened.
But the apparent calm has suddenly been broken, with the conservative
rebels who brought down the old system voting to dissolve their new
parties in a kind of parliamentary free-for-all and the Socialists, led
by Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, on the verge of splitting because
of a deep ideological rift.
At a big rally Saturday, a group of several dozen Socialists, led by
the party's secretary general, Wataru Kubo, openly called for the
dissolution of the party and the formation of a new centrist one that
would include more middle-of-the-road Socialists and other liberals.
Across town, Murayama, who represents the traditional left wing,
rejected disbanding his party. But it was clear that his power was
ebbing and that for the first time since his coalition government took
office in June, it was facing the prospect of being unseated.
As a result of the turmoil, the world's second-largest economy is
heading toward deepening political turmoil. Adding to the sense of
confusion is the fact that the Parliament has introduced a new election
system that is bound to change the character of the legislature.
In one of the most potent symbols of the reordering, the Japan New
Party of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, whose formation
prefigured the extraordinary realignment of Japanese politics, has
voted to disband.
And the remaining conservative and centrist opposition parties said
they would dissolve by early next month, bringing to a close the brief
period when this group of renegades broke the old political mold.
In June 1993 a group of nearly 50 members of the conservative Liberal
Democratic Party defected and formed several of these new parties,
ending 38 years of one-party rule by the Liberal Democrats. If they did
not change things permanently, they did create the opportunity for real
change for the first time since the early days of the cold war.
``What we did had great significance, because we proved there can be a
change of government in Japan,'' said Tsutomu Hata, the leader of the
Japan Renewal Party, who was Prime Minister for a turbulent period last
spring.
The opposition groups said they would form a loosely knit party, to be
called the New Frontier Party. They vowed to unite to bring down the
governing coalition, consisting of the Socialists and the Liberal
Democratic Party.
But a number of leaders of the opposition group said it would probably
disband soon, perhaps right after the next election.
``In a way, this is a transitional step,'' said Kazuo Aichi, a former
defense minister and a leader of the nascent party. ``This group has
not exactly agreed on a platform. Rather, this resulted from a number
of parties getting together that happened to be in the opposition.``
Murayama, who led the Socialists in abandoning their entire platform of
leftist policies, has been struggling to halt a movement to disband and
recreate the party as a centrist alternative. The fear is that such a
move could force the government to collapse by alienating the party's
old left wing.
The Socialist rebels have suggested that they might compromise by
voting on dissolution soon but waiting until mid-1995 to disband. But
that option appears unlikely to repair the rift in the party.
Ikuo Kabashima, a political scientist at Tsukuba University who polls
voters on their attitudes, said the Japanese had shown a growing
disillusionment with all parties. The number who say they do not
support any party has soared, from 37 percent at the beginning of this
year to 55 percent in his latest survey.
``Simply put, there's a great deal of confusion about whom to
support,'' he said.
