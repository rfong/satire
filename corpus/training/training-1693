Turkey ready to help train Bosnian soldiers 
Turkey is prepared to help train Bosnia's regular army, visiting Prime
Minister Tansu Ciller said here Tuesday.
"The modalities of the military cooperation will be defined later," she
told a news conference, adding: "We also want to help with Bosnia's
reconstruction."
"During the Islamic conference in Malaysia, Turkey was asked to
coordinate the Islamic world's desire to help in the reconstruction of
Bosnia," she added, referring to a session of the Organisation of the
Islamic Conference.
"We do not envisage the reconstruction of Bosnia purely in economic
terms but also as a means of ensuring the successful implementation of
the peace accord."
A US-brokered accord to end the Bosnian conflict was signed by the
presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia in the United States a week
ago.
