Tomba Wins Kitzbuehel Slalom
Alberto Tomba streaked to his sixth consecutive slalom win of the season by
almost a second Sunday and moved into third place in the all-time list of
World Cup victories.
Tomba had the best time on both runs to total 1 minute, 37.26 seconds.
That was .82 second ahead of Slovenian Jure Kosir. third was Ole
Christian Furuseth of Norway, 1:38.20.
It was Tomba's 41st win of his career to put him behind only Ingemar
Stenmark (86) and Marc Girardelli (43).
Tomba has not lost in six slaloms this season and carries a streak of
eight straight from last year. He also has two giant slalom victories
this season.
Tomba still leads in the overall standings with 850 points.
The results of the slalom will also be added with the second men's
downhill from Saturday to determine a combined winner.
Luc Alphand of France, who took both races Saturday in an historic
downhill doubleheader, did not enter the slalom to save himself for
Monday's Super-G.
