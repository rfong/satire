Four Hospitalized with Radiation Sickness 
Four people have been hospitalized after receiving massive doses of
radiation in the village of Kiisa, the Baltic News Service reported
Friday.
The latest victim was a 13-year-old boy, hospitalized Thursday with
severe radiation sickness. His dog died a few hours earlier, presumably
of radiation poisoning.
The source of the radiation has not been found, but rescuers were
focusing on a kitchen in a house where radiation measured over 100
roentgens per hour, a lethal level, the news agency said.
It wasn't clear whether any of those hospitalized had any contact with
the house.
Authorities evacuated about 20 people from 10 nearby homes in Kiisa, a
village of 350 people located about 35 kilometers (21 miles) south of
Tallinn.
As a precaution, about 60 villagers were also being checked at nearby
hospitals for exposure to radiation.
Authorities have warned people to avoid the region until after the
source of the radioactivity has been pinpointed.
Estonian Minister of Energy Arvo Niitenberg told KUKU radio that the
radioactivity could come from an illegal, radioactive cache.
Radioactive materials have been found earlier this year in Estonia,
reportedly a transit point for smugglers in the former Soviet Union. In
August, police seized a stash of low-grade uranium buried under a
private garage in a small southern Estonian town.
Estonians have also accused the Russian military of dumping hazardous
materials, including radioactive waste, before withdrawing from the
country in August.
