Karadzic still in power, IFOR must act: Izetbegovic 
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is still in power after the "failure" of
an effort by international civilian official Carl Bildt to unseat him,
the Bosnian president said Monday.
"Karadzic has remained in the saddle," Izetbegovic said here after
meeting Flavio Cotti, head of the Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
"Obviously Mr. Bildt has not succeeded in what he was doing,"
Izetbegovic added.
"We said that (the removal of Karadzic from power) should be done by
the IFOR (implementation force) or that a new pressure should be put on
(Serbian President Slobodan) Milosevic since he took that obligation in
Dayton."
Bildt, the top civilian official in Bosnia, over the weekend attempted
to unseat Karadzic, who has been twice indicted for war crimes,
including genocide.
He failed and now Karadzic "will try to strengthen his position
conducting some sort of a referendum there which has to be prevented,"
Izetbegovic said.
The Bosnian president said Karadzic's removal from power was "the key
issue" if elections were to be held.
Elections are scheduled by the Dayton peace treaty to take place by
September 14.
Cotti, whose organisation is charged with running the elections, said
the decision on whether or not the vote would go ahead would be taken
"in the next weeks."
"If Karadzic were removed from the political scene, we think there
would be a very quick acceleration in the process of democratisation,"
in the Serb entity, Izetbegovic said.
"At the moment, the conditions for the elections do not exist."
"Without, there is no chance for a fair election," Izetbegovic said.
"The presence of the indicted war criminals (in power in the Serb
entity) represents a great obstacle for free and fair elections," Cotti
added.
