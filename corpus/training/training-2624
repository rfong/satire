Afghanistan needs an army of 250,000, defense official 
Afghanistan needs an immediate army of 200,000 to 250,000 men,
comprised mainly of mujahedin, a senior defense ministry official said
Wednesday.
"We will not recruit anyone who fought on the side of the Taliban, but
will take those who have worked for the government, especially
mujahedin," said Saleh Registany, who heads the defense ministry's
foreign relations department.
Registany said only 10 percent of the foreigners who fought with Osama
bin Laden's terrorist al-Qaeda network had been captured while 90
percent escaped.
"They came from 13 or 14 countries, and according to our information
they want to return to Afghanistan from Pakistan," he told AFP.
"It is to get rid of these people that we need an army of 200,000 to
250,000 soldiers."
Registany said the military recuits would be drawn from an estimated
700,000 to 800,000 people who possess weapons in Afghanistan.
"At the same time we must begin creating a national army for the future
government of Afghanistan, and we will need a force of 60,000 men in
times of peace," he said.
"We have called on the radio for 200 people from each province,
totalling 6,000 people, who we will train as soldiers and officers in
three to six months. Then we will send them to various barracks around
the country."
