Indonesia's state oil firm signs five contracts with foreign firms 
Indonesia's state-owned oil company Pertamina has signed five
production-sharing contracts with foreign petroleum companies, a
newspaper report said Tuesday.
Three new contracts were awarded to Eurafrep Resources of The
Netherlands for exploration off Central Java, Canada's Petroleum
Indonesia for a block off Maluku and the US-based Chevron Sibolga and
Texaco Exploration Sibolga for a block off North Sumatra.
The new contractors are required to spend at least 27 million dollars,
42.8 million dollars and 22.8 million dollars respectively during their
first 10 years of exploration, the Jakarta Post reported.
The two other contracts signed on Monday extended existing agreements
with US-based Santa Fe Energy Resources and Asamera Overseas Ltd., a
subsidiary of Gulf Canada Resources.
"The two contracts are extended for another 20 years, from 2000 to 2020
for Santa Fe in Irian Jaya and from 2003 to 2023 for Asamera in South
Sumatra," said Minister for Mines and Energy Ida Bagus Sujana.
Santa Fe, in partnership with Coparex, Ciegco Vogelkop and Mitsui Oil
Exploration, must spend 10.2 million dollars in its first five years,
while Asamera must spend 65 million dollars in its first nine years of
exploration.
Sujana said Pertamina was due to sign a number of new contracts with
foreign oil companies before the end of the year, adding that "at least
six" were being considered.
Pertamina now has 59 production-sharing with foreign companies.
