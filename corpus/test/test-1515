U.N. Demands Cease-Fire and Return of Heavy Weapons
After a day of vicious battles shook the city, the United Nations
issued an ultimatum Wednesday to the Bosnian government and besieging
Serbs: Stop fighting around Sarajevo or face NATO airstrikes.
Tanks, cannons and mortars bombarded the capital and its outskirts,
setting houses ablaze and killing at least six people in clashes
following the failure of U.S. peace efforts.
U.N. officials first said there was little they could do to stop the
fighting, which began south of the city center around a strategic hill
and spread to the west and north. NATO jets flew low over the front
line, but did not attack.
But Wednesday night, the U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Rupert
Smith, announced an ultimatum.
Four heavy weapons that had been taken out of U.N. storage depots
around the city must be returned by noon Thursday (4 a.m. EDT), he
said. All other heavy weapons in a 12.5-mile zone around the Bosnian
capital must be cleared out or turned in to the United Nations 24 hours
later.
``Failure to comply with either deadline will result in the offending
party or parties being attacked from the air,'' Smith said.
Heavy weapons were banned from around the capital last year under
threat of NATO airstrikes, but raids on the U.N. depots where they were
stored have grown as the threat of NATO retaliation has faded. Some of
those weapons were being used to fire on the city.
Relations between the United Nations and the Bosnian Serbs were badly
strained after a series of NATO raids last November _ the last NATO
action in the former Yugoslavia.
The Serbs detained hundreds of peacekeepers, and the United Nations has
been reluctant to call in airstrikes since then.
But Wednesday's ultimatum apparently reflected U.N. frustration over
signs that the two sides were intent on settling their differences on
the battlefield rather than seeking a negotiated peace.
In a statement issued before the ultimatum was announced, the U.N.
chief envoy to former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, said the use of heavy
weapons around Sarajevo was ``extremely dangerous and volatile'' and
could not be tolerated.
Early last week Sarajevo endured its most vicious shelling in two
years, and tensions have been building in the city since then.
Wednesday's explosion of fighting also seemed linked to the failure of
a U.S. effort to drive a new wedge between the Bosnian Serbs and their
former mentor, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Hundreds of detonations rocked Sarajevo and snipers opened up, forcing
civilians from the streets. Fighting set fire to houses near the Jewish
cemetery on the front line closest to the city center. Some residents,
overwhelmed by the violence, cried as they watched their homes burn.
The United Nations said the fighting was initiated by Bosnian Serb
forces around Debelo Brdo, a heavily fortified hillside just south of
downtown Sarajevo.
Last week, Bosnian Serbs tried to take out Bosnian army gunners there
who were targeting a key road connecting Serb-held territories south
and east of the city.
At least five people were reported killed and 24 wounded in
government-controlled parts of the city Wednesday. An 8-year-old girl
was killed and seven civilians were wounded by shells that pounded the
Serb-held suburb of Grbavica, reported SRNA, the Bosnian Serb news
agency.
A French peacekeeper, a 20-month-old boy and four girls were among the
wounded.
``I have to admit there is very little the United Nations can do to
stop the escalating of heavy fighting,'' U.N. spokesman Alexander
Ivanko said early in the day.
The fighting followed an inconclusive U.S. diplomatic push to get
Milosevic, Serbia's president, to recognize Bosnia-Herzegovina, a move
that would increase pressure on Bosnian Serbs to return to peace talks.
American envoy Robert Frasure had offered to seek the suspension of
U.N. sanctions on Serbia in return. But Milosevic wouldn't budge from
his demand for an end _ not a suspension _ to the 3-year-old embargo
punishing Serb-led Yugoslavia for inciting the Bosnian war.
Russian presidential envoy Alexander Zotov arrived in the Serbian
capital, Belgrade, on Wednesday to take up where Frasure left off.
Frasure's failure was sure to boost Bosnian Serb spirits. Milosevic
already has ended his support for rebel Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia in
his quest to end the crippling sanctions. Recognition would have
finalized the break.
