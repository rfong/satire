Unions demands EU suspend trade advantages to Pakistan 
International trade union organisations on Friday called on the
European Union to suspend preferential trading conditions currently
accorded to Pakistan because of its failure to seriously tackle the
widespread use of child labour.
The appeal, issued jointly by the International Congress of Free Trade
Unions and the European Trade Union Committee for the textiles,
clothing and leather industries, came on the eve of a visit to Pakistan
by European Commissioner Manuel Marin.
Pakistan has "systematically violated" all the laws and conventions it
has signed relating to child labour, the unions said.
They said Marin should seek to discover whether any progress has been
made by the Pakistani authorities. If not, Pakistan should be excluded
from the EU's Generalised System of Preferences, a system of tariff
preferences designed to help exporters in developing countries sell
their goods in Europe.
Marin was due in Pakistan on Saturday, where he is due to meet Benazir
Bhutto.
