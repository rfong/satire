Arabs should halt normalisation with Israel: Hezbollah 
The leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas has urged Arab
countries to stop normalising ties with Israel, the Saudi daily
Al-Hayat reported Monday.
"We ask the Arabs ... to stop normalising ties with Israel and to stand
alongside Lebanon and Syria until the situation is cleared up," Sheikh
Hassan Nasrallah told a rally in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley,
referring to the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon.
Nasrallah pledged that Hezbollah, which spearheads anti-Israeli attacks
in south Lebanon, will continue to fight Israeli occupation of a buffer
zone in the region.
Twenty one Arab leaders ended a two-day summit in Cairo on Sunday with
a strongly-worded warning to Israel to respect its commitments and
trade land for peace or risk sparking new tensions in the Middle East.
The summit's final declaration warned the peace process could be thrown
into reverse if Israel fails to live up to its commitments, and that
fledging moves towards the Jewish state by some Arab states could be
stopped.
Iran has hailed the results of the summit, which it said showed Arab
countries had realised their mistake in trying to make peace with
Israel. Syria also voiced satisfaction at the final declaration.
Morocco, Tunisia and Qatar, three Arab countries which have begun
normalising ties with Israel warned on Sunday that the future of these
relations now depended on progress toward overall Middle East peace.
