Mandela/VBG to/TO complete/VB South/NNP Africa/NNP 's/POS transition/NN by/IN signing/VBG new/JJ constitution/NN by/IN Steve/NNP Matthewson/NNP When/WRB President/NNP Nelson/NNP Mandela/VBD signs/NNS South/NNP Africa/NNP 's/POS new/JJ constitution/NN into/IN law/NN Tuesday/NNP ,/, he/PRP will/MD finally/RB wrap-up/VB the/DT remarkable/JJ political/JJ transition/NN that/WDT was/VBD started/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ predecessor/NN almost/RB seven/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./.

Mandela/NNP is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO endorse/VB the/DT basic/JJ law/NN document/NN at/IN a/DT public/JJ ceremony/NN at/IN the/DT site/NN where/WRB apartheid/NN police/NNS gunned/VBN down/RP more/JJR than/IN 69/CD unarmed/JJ protestors/NNS in/IN 1960/CD ,/, in/IN the/DT otherwise/RB unremarkable/JJ township/NN of/IN Sharpeville/JJ south/NN of/IN Johannesburg/NNP ./.

Chosen/VBG to/TO coincide/VB with/IN International/NNP Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Day/NNP ,/, the/DT event/NN will/MD signal/VB the/DT end/NN of/IN what/WP is/VBZ often/RB called/VBN the/DT ``/`` negotiated/JJ revolution/NN ''/'' ./.

The/DT dramatic/JJ process/NN began/VBD in/IN February/NNP 1990/CD when/WRB Frederik/NNP de/IN Klerk/NNP ,/, the/DT last/JJ in/IN a/DT long/JJ line/NN of/IN white/JJ presidents/NNS ,/, released/VBD Mandela/NNP and/CC other/JJ political/JJ prisoners/NNS ,/, opening/VBG the/DT way/NN for/IN negotiations/NNS between/IN oppressor/NN and/CC oppressed/NN ./.

Initially/RB ,/, the/DT detente/NN was/VBD fragile/JJ ./.

The/DT first/JJ round/NN of/IN formal/JJ multi-party/JJ talks/NNS began/VBD in/IN December/NNP 1991/CD amid/IN bloody/JJ political/JJ violence/NN and/CC accusations/NNS that/IN de/NNP Klerk/NNP 's/POS government/NN was/VBD involved/VBN in/IN ``/`` dirty/JJ tricks/NNS ''/'' against/IN the/DT black/JJ liberation/NN movements/NNS which/WDT were/VBD still/RB struggling/VBG to/TO transform/VB themselves/PRP into/IN bona/JJ fide/JJ political/JJ parties/NNS ./.

The/DT Convention/NN for/IN a/DT Democratic/NNP South/NNP Africa/NNP ,/, as/IN the/DT negotiating/NN forum/NN was/VBD first/RB known/VBN ,/, collapsed/VBD five/CD months/NNS later/RB ./.

Only/RB in/IN 1993/CD ,/, after/IN several/JJ political/JJ crises/NNS tested/VBN their/PRP$ relationship/NN to/TO the/DT limit/NN ,/, did/VBD the/DT ruling/NN National/NNP Party/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- NP/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC Mandela/NNP 's/POS African/NNP National/NNP Congress/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- ANC/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- agree/VBP on/IN a/DT ``/`` power-sharing/JJ formula/NN ''/'' and/CC ``/`` the/DT new/JJ South/NNP Africa/NNP ''/'' began/VBD to/TO take/VB shape/NN ./.

Guided/VBN by/IN the/DT ANC/NNP 's/POS chief/JJ negotiator/NN Cyril/NNP Ramaphosa/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ NP/NNP counterpart/NN Roelf/NNP Meyer/NNP ,/, party/NN delegates/NNS at/IN the/DT World/NNP Trade/NNP Centre/NNP east/JJ of/IN Johannesburg/NNP agreed/VBN on/IN an/DT interim/JJ constitution/NN that/WDT would/MD provide/VB for/IN the/DT first/JJ all-race/JJ election/NN ./.

In/IN terms/NNS of/IN this/DT first/JJ basic-law/NN document/NN ,/, runners-up/NNS in/IN the/DT poll/NN were/VBD guaranteed/VBN government/NN seats/NNS and/CC a/DT ``/`` final/JJ ''/'' constitution/NN would/MD be/VB drafted/VBN by/IN the/DT new/JJ 490-member/JJ parliament/NN ,/, sitting/VBG as/IN the/DT Constitutional/NNP Assembly/NNP ./.

While/IN the/DT deal/NN satisfied/VBD the/DT two/CD main/JJ players/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD struck/VBN without/IN the/DT sanction/NN of/IN Mangosuthu/NNP Buthelezi/NNP 's/POS Zulu-nationalist/NNP Inkatha/NNP Freedom/NNP Party/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- IFP/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT abandoned/VBD the/DT talks/NNS and/CC threatened/VBD to/TO boycott/VB the/DT historic/JJ 1994/CD poll/NN ./.

The/DT constitution/NN 's/POS failure/NN to/TO satisfy/VB the/DT IFP/NN ,/, the/DT political/JJ home/NN of/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS eight/CD million/CD Zulus/NNS ,/, remained/VBD its/PRP$ most/RBS glaring/JJ flaw/NN and/CC came/VBD back/RP to/TO haunt/VB negotiators/NNS ./.

Although/IN the/DT IFP/NN was/VBD eventually/RB persuaded/VBN to/TO take/VB part/NN in/IN the/DT election/NN and/CC took/VBD its/PRP$ seats/NNS as/IN the/DT third/JJ partner/NN in/IN the/DT national/JJ unity/NN government/NN ,/, it/PRP again/RB walked/VBD out/RP of/IN the/DT Constitutional/NNP Assembly/NNP when/WRB the/DT last/JJ leg/NN of/IN the/DT constitution-writing/JJ process/NN began/VBD in/IN 1995/CD ./.

The/DT IFP/NN ,/, whose/WP$ supporters/NNS had/VBD been/VBN engaged/VBN in/IN a/DT bloody/JJ territorial/JJ war/NN with/IN the/DT ANC/NNP since/IN 1985/CD ,/, warned/VBD it/PRP would/MD not/RB recognize/VB a/DT constitution/NN that/WDT did/VBD not/RB grant/VB greater/JJR autonomy/NN for/IN its/PRP$ KwaZulu-Natal/JJ province/NN stronghold/NN ./.

Despite/IN the/DT IFP/NN 's/POS boycott/NN and/CC occassional/JJ outbursts/NNS from/IN the/DT white/JJ far/RB right/RB ,/, and/CC after/IN 18/CD months/NNS of/IN open/JJ hearings/NNS ,/, last/JJ minute/NN deals/NNS and/CC thousands/NNS of/IN public/JJ sumbissions/NNS ,/, the/DT assembly/NN passed/VBD the/DT new/JJ basic/JJ law/NN document/NN with/IN the/DT required/JJ two-thirds/NNS majority/NN in/IN May/NNP this/DT year/NN ./.

Even/RB then/RB ,/, the/DT powerful/JJ ,/, new/JJ Constitutional/NNP Court/NNP ,/, flexed/VBD its/PRP$ legal/JJ muscle/NN and/CC sent/VBD the/DT document/NN back/RB to/TO the/DT legislators/NNS to/TO review/VB eight/CD critical/JJ clauses/NNS ,/, and/CC only/RB approved/VBD the/DT constitution/NN in/IN early/JJ December/NNP ./.

Described/VBN as/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJS liberal/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, the/DT constitution/NN outlaws/VBZ racial/JJ discrimination/NN ,/, guarantees/VBZ full/JJ rights/NNS for/IN homosexuals/NNS ,/, provides/VBZ for/IN abortion-on-demand/JJ and/CC forbids/VBZ capital/NN punishment/NN ./.

It/PRP entrenches/VBZ South/NNP Africa/NNP 's/POS new/JJ political/JJ order/NN ,/, by/IN scrapping/VBG the/DT interim/JJ multi-party/JJ government/NN but/CC guaranteeing/VBG multi-party/JJ parliamentary/JJ elections/NNS and/CC a/DT host/NN of/IN basic/JJ rights/NNS ,/, while/IN restructuring/VBG and/CC streamlining/VBG parliamentary/JJ structures/NNS ./.
