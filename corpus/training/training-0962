Dollar mixed, gold moves higher 
The dollar was mixed against major currencies Wednesday with the New
York market in a lull.
Traders were selling until it became clear the greenback was not going
to follow blue-chip stocks and the bond market on their upward trend,
said Ed Neminski, a Nomura Securities trader.
He linked the dollar's poor showing to the weakness of the Mexican peso
and the Canadian dollar, saying there was a crisis of confidence in
North American currencies.
Trading dropped off inn the afternoon and wound up the session at
midday levels.
Gold picked up 20 cents from Tuesday's close to hit 376.60 dollars per
ounce.
At 2215 GMT, the greenback was trading at 1.5090 German marks down from
1.5092 late Tuesday. Against the Japanese yen it dipped to 98.35 from
98.50 late Tuesday.
The dollar was up slightly against other major European currencies,
trading at 5.2395 French francs from 5.2315 late Tuesday, 1.2755 Swiss
francs from 1.2740 and at 0.6404 pound sterling from 0.6400.
The Mexican peso slipped to 5.98 to the dollar from 5.81 late Tuesday
due to the poor showing on Mexico's bond market.
