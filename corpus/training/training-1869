Storm Damage Surpasses 40 Million Dollars in U.S. 
Preliminary damage estimates from Dennis, which weakened from a
hurricane to a tropical depression, exceeded 43 million U.S. dollars in
North Carolina State of the United States, officials said Tuesday.
As a hurricane, Dennis sideswiped the Outer Banks last week, then went
out to sea and stalled. It backtracked and came ashore on Saturday,
then slowly made its way inland, dumping up to 50 centimeters (20
inches) of rain on North Carolina coastal areas.
Meanwhile, the saturated atmosphere left over from Dennis caused
flooding Tuesday in parts of Pennsylvania State, where many areas were
soaked by 5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches) of rain, and schools were
closed in several communities.
Some 175 people were evacuated from low-lying sections of Lycoming
County, in north-central Pennsylvania, and several people were rescued
from flooded campgrounds in nearby Snyder County.
