Government Survives Fifth No Confidence Vote
The government of Nicolae Vacaroiu narrowly survived a vote of
no-confidence Friday, despite general criticism of its economic policies.
The government won the vote by 249-206 after six hours of heated
debate. It was the fifth time the parliament voted on a no-confidence
motion against Vacaroiu since he took office two years ago.
Relying on the support of ultra-nationalists and former Communists for
his left-wing coalition, Vacaroiu quoted favorable economic statistics
to a joint sitting of deputies of the lower house and senators in the
upper chamber.
The government needed at least 243 votes to survive -- an absolute
majority of the parliament's 484 members.
The vote, which coincided with the fifth anniversary of the collapse of
communism, illustrated the disappointment felt by many over falling
living standards and political uncertainty.
Opposition lawmakers accused Vacaroiu of dragging his feet on
privatization, saying his policies have caused widespread poverty.
But Vacaroiu, who recently caved in to economic demands from thousands
of discontented workers, claimed his policies have put Romania on the
right track to a market economy.
He cited his successes in getting inflation down from 300 percent to 70
percent a year, and increasing hard currency reserves.
But lawmakers protested that improvements were cosmetic.
``We are not at the end of the tunnel but on the verge of a profound
social crisis,'' said deputy Radu Vasile of the opposition Peasants'
Party.
Five years ago, Romanians toppled the Communist regime of Nicolae
Ceausescu in a 10-day revolt that left more than 1,000 dead. One of the
reasons for the uprising was economic hardship.
Vacaroiu, a former tax inspector in the Finance Ministry, said some
things were better.
``Romania used to import wheat, but now we have reserves for two years
and we can even export some,'' he said in a debate broadcast live on
national radio.
But opposition lawmakers protested Vacaroiu had failed to live up to
his promises.
``This government promised they will prevent living standards from
falling,'' said former Premier Petre Roman, whose Democratic Party
initiated the motion. He claimed the majority of Romanians now live
below the poverty line.
