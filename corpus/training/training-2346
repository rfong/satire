U.S. Movie Houses File Suit Against EU
A joint venture of Hollywood movie houses said Thursday it has sued the
European Union for discriminating against two film productions it was
to distribute.
In a statement, United International Pictures BV accused the EU of
blocking financial guarantees for the productions pending a decision on
whether UIP can operate in Europe under an antitrust exemption.
UIP is a joint venture of Paramount, Metro Goldwyn Mayer and MCA. It
was formed to distribute films outside the United States and Canada.
MGM is owned by France's Credit Lyonnais. MCA is a unit of Japan's
Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. Ltd.
The suit also names the European Film Distribution Office, which was
set up under the EU's media program to provide financial guarantees to
producers seeking to distribute low-budget films in Europe.
It provides loans of up to 100,000 European currency units (dlrs
123,000) per country per film to cover the initial cost of
distribution. If the films are a success, the loans are repayable.
In its statement, UIP claimed the EU-backed fund rejected requests for
support from the producers of films ``Maniaci Sentimentali'' and
``Nostradamus'' because they had chosen UIP as their distributor.
UIP and the European Commission, the executive agency of the 12-nation
trading bloc, are at odds in two antitrust cases concerning the
distribution of films for cinema and for television.
UIP's antitrust exemption for cinema distribution expired in July 1993,
and the commission is considering whether to renew it.
