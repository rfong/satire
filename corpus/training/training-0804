Ugandan Vice-President to Visit Famine-Hit Region 
Ugandan Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe is to pitch camp in Karamoja in
the northeastern Uganda for 10 days to discuss strategies to tackle the
food crisis in the region, the New Vision newspaper reported Thursday.
Kazibwe and Minister of Disaster Preparedness Tom Butime made an
impromptu visit to assess the famine situation in the region last
Wednesday following press reports that many people died of starvation
there.
The vice-president would go back to Karamoja next week to lay a
sustainable program in which different projects including water and
food conservation will be designed, the report said.
The Karamoja region was worst hit by drought in the country and almost
90 percent of the population in Moroto District in the region are
facing food shortage.
Currently, some 11 out of 45 districts in the country have been
severely affected by the persisting drought and the estimated crop
yield in the affected districts stood at 30 percent.
About 4 billion Uganda shillings (2.6 million U.S. dollars) are needed
to urgently buy relief food for the famine-stricken areas in Uganda.
