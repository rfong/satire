Russia's Economy Up 8 percent in 1999: Official 
The 1999 year saw Russia's economy unquestionably growing 7.5-8 percent
with gross domestic product up 1.5-2 percent from the previous year,
said Russian First Deputy Economy Minister Arkady Samokhvalov, Tuesday.
The growths "are easy to check, and there is no slyness behind these
figures," he said, however, stressing that the government needs to work
harder to sustain this apparent growth.
"It was not the only basis for the growth that import-replacing
production was developing as a result of a sharp increase in the cost
of imports after August 17, 1998, because real economic growth had been
in evidence in 1997 and in the first half of 1998, when there was no
devaluation," he said.
"By the start of last year, certain objective conditions had been
created in Russia for more intensive manufacturing, and industrial
enterprises had adapted to new, market conditions," he said.
Tax reforms and new legislation, including local laws for protecting
investments, and a rise in world oil prices were also helpful,
Samokhvalov said.
"The main task for 2000 is to sustain and intensify the investment
process in the country, and also to strengthen the positive dynamics of
the population's consumer demand, a trend for which appeared in 1999,"
stated the official.
