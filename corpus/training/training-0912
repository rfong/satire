Qatari emir deplores Bahrain's spying charges 
The emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad ibn Khalifa Al Thani on Friday strongly
condemned the charges of spying laid by Bahraini authorities against
two Qatari citizens.
Sheikh Hamad expressed his "profound regret" over the accusations
during a visit to the home of the father of one of the two suspected
spies, Fahd Abdallah al-Bakker, the official QNA news agency reported.
Bahrain on Monday announced the arrests of Bakker, 28, described as a
Qatari intelligence officer, and Salwa Jassim Mahmoud Fakhri, 33, a
Qatari woman he allegedly recruited as a spy. Doha has denied the
accusations.
Qatar's interior ministry has accused the Bahraini authorities of using
torture to extract confessions, saying that any verdict would be "null
and void."
However, in Manama a spokesman for the Bahraini public prosecutor late
Friday denied the torture allegations, saying "the two are given
medical attention and good treatment, as each of them attested during
the first court session."
The case is "now with the court and justice will say its final word by
terms of the law," the spokesman told the official GNA news agency,
adding that the defendants had chosen their own lawyers.
The two appeared on Wednesday before the state security court, which
adjourned the hearing to December 14. They could face the death penalty
if found guilty.
Manama has said the spying incident has hardened its determination to
boycott the Gulf Cooperation Council summit which opens Saturday
because of a long-running territorial dispute with Qatar over the Hawar
islands which Fakhri allegedly visited to spy on Bahraini military
sites.
