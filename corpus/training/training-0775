WTO set to approve Ruggiero appointment 
Members of the World Trade Organisation on Thursday gathered to
formalise approval of the nomination of former Italian trade minister
Renato Ruggiero as director general of the fledgling WTO.
Their meeting, which comes after most members have approved in
principle Rugiero's nomination after months of bickering, failed to
start on schedule at noon (1100 GMT) because some delegates, notably
from Africa, raised last-minute demands.
The meeting had not begun more than an hour later.
But a press conference organised by the European Union, backer of
Ruggioero's candidacy, has already been scheduled for 1530 GMT in this
Swiss city.
The WTO council is set to convene on Friday to formally appoint
Rugiero.
