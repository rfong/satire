Ethiopian Speaker Calls for Political Empowerment 
Ethiopian House Speaker Dawit Yohannes Wednesday called for political
empowerment of citizens, saying it will provide a solid foundation for
the respect of human rights in Ethiopia.
Opening a three-day national conference here on the institutions for
the protection of human rights, the speaker of the House of People's
Representatives said governmental and non-governmental institutions
should uphold the political rights of the people, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported.
The Ethiopian people organized into the federal democratic system are
significantly contributing towards the consolidation of the on-going
process of democratization, he said.
The establishment of human rights commission and the office of the
ombudsman would help prevent human right violations and administrative
injustices.
Speaking at the conference, Abdulaziz Ahmed, chairman of the legal
affairs standing committee of the House, stressed the importance of the
institutions for the protection of human rights in enabling the various
government bodies to live up to their responsibilities.
Girma Amare, legal affairs director of the Ethiopian foreign ministry
announced at the conference that Ethiopia has ratified about 18
international treaties regarding human rights, saying that there seems
to be no legal problem in adhering to its international obligations.
The conference is attended by over 1,000 participants from the
parliament, governmental institutions, scholars and renowned
personalities.
The national conference is held five days ahead of the international
conference on the establishment of the Ethiopian Human Rights
Commission and the Office of Ombudsman, which will draw delegations
from about 65 countries across the world including China.
