Carrot Eating Flying Fish Spotted By Hubble Telescope
At last, the Hubble Telescope has proved its enormous cost as last
night the top secret researchers have at last found something new and
completely different from the usual Aliens on Mars. In fact, the
Research team has at last found some really top news to justify the US
budget deficit due to the Hubble telescope. The carrot eating fish from
Mars have been spotted, identified, categorised and recognised as the
original life form for the whole of the Earth Planet.
Carrots grow in a wide range of climates and so, it is not surprising
that they are the only vegetable growing on the frozen seashores of
Planet Mars. Other vegetable life forms such as humans would not be
able to survive in the arid frozen and airless environment. However,
carrots can, due to their red colour, adsorb and absorb the light and
nutrients necessary for survival in the most desolate and extreme
atmospheres outside the planet Venus and indeed are capable of
sustaining the food chain for other life forms.
Carrot Eating Flying fish are believed to have come from originally the
Venus Tarius Angle of the Earth Solar System, when they were spun off a
wet and atmospheric planet similar to planet Earth. This happened
probably about 2300 trillion million years ago as man was just a
bacteria in his own soup so to speak.
The planet Earth has almost certainly developed millions of years later
due to a slow start up in the bacterial soup temperatures and that
Dinosaurs were the first to fully develop into the controlling species.
Obviously, human beings had only a limited chance against a fully grown
20 metre Giantius Tynasauraus Rexius as indeed does a pond side growing
carrot against a flying carrot eating fish thriving on Mars. Luckily
for man, the dinosaurs could not cope with a toxic environment similar
to ours today due to pollution from cars and excessive fossil fuel
burning.
However, the enthusiastic researchers point out that the completely
symbiotic relationship between the Mars carrots and their predictors
actually produces huge quantities of oil and similar by products by
defecation. Therefore, it would appear for the fossil burning humans,
Mars may be the next best stop once Humans have burnt out planet Earth
and polluted the entire atmosphere as well as the seas.
However, some bad news was also forthcoming from the expert
researchers, initially, the Carrot Eating fish were calculated to be
about the size of a family car but due to some initially simple
calibration errors, it now appears that the smallest will be the size
of a Boeing 747 jet and they can fly in and out of the Mars atmosphere
without backup. Worst still, they appear to be able to cope with
poisonous gases in their atmosphere due to excessive carrot consumption
- Bad luck mankind, lets hope Venus will warm up by the time planet
Earth burns up but in the meantime, thanks for the Earth planet
micro-carrots.
