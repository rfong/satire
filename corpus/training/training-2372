Peace talks
Karadzic, whose forces have been at war with the Muslim-led Bosnian
government since 1992, issued a ``last call'' for ``immediate direct
talks on peace, with cessation of all offensives.''
He called for a return to the battle lines of Dec. 23, when the warring
sides agreed to a cease-fire negotiated by former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter. It was followed by a four-month truce signed on Dec. 31, which
has all but collapsed in the meantime.
By direct peace talks, Karadzic meant talks with the Muslim leadership,
apparently without foreign mediation.
Isolated and left without support from powerful Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic, Karadzic's move reflected a last-ditch attempt to
avoid further losses to Muslim-led government forces in northern and
central Bosnia.
