South Africa's AIDS rate set to skyrocket: insurance executive 
The number of people in South Africa with full-blown AIDS will likely
increase ten-fold to more than 100,000 by the next century, a top
insurance executive predicted here Monday.
Peter Toyle, a senior executive at Metropolitan Life, one of the
country's largest insurance companies, said South Africa is on track to
fulfill the worst predictions made five or six years ago about the
disease, the SAPA news agency reported.
By the end of 1995, an estimated 10 percent of South Africans, or 1.5
million people were believed to be carrying the HIV virus, which causes
AIDS, he said.
Only 10,000 people were believed to have full-blown AIDS at this stage,
he added, although the real figure could be three times higher, he
added.
Also Monday, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma told a radio station that
she was disappointed South Africans had not worked together to bring
down the level of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
Despite efforts by the government and private non-profit groups, South
Africa's AIDS population is increasingly out of control, she said.
