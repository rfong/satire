South Korean president's son takes huge commission: report 
A son of South Korean President Kim Young-Sam received a 200 billion
won (226 million dollar) commission from a German firm in connection
with machinery imports, a television report said Friday.
Yonhap Television News quoted prosecutors as saying the equipment was
imported by the now-failed Hanbo business Group from the German firm in
1994.
There was no immediate confirmation of the report from the prosecutor's
office which is probing high-level corruption in connection with the
collapse of the Hanbo Group in January.
