HK, Guangdong Hold Talks on Anti-Illegal Immigration 
Director of Operations of Hong Kong Police Ng Ching-kwok and his party
held fruitful discussions with the border security agencies in
Guangdong on further cooperation to fight against illegal immigration
today.
Returning from a one-day visit this evening, Ng said that both sides
reviewed the illegal immigration situation prevailing over the past
three to four months, particularly the recent influx of minor illegal
immigrants.
Both sides agreed to further strengthen the exchange of intelligence on
illegal immigration with an emphasis on that concerning the aiders and
abettors.
He said that both sides also agreed to enhance cooperation in
anti-illegal immigration operations.
In the afternoon, Ng and his party viewed an anti-illegal immigration
exercise by the Chinese inland area authority.
"We are impressed by the professionalism showed by our counterparts in
the Chinese mainland and are confident of their determination to put a
halt to illegal immigration," he said.
Both sides will launch a co-ordinated exercise next month to show their
determination in the fight against illegal immigration.
