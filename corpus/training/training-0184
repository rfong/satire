Israel gives green light for Arafat's return 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin gave the go-ahead on Wednesday for a visit
by PLO leader Yasser Arafat to the Gaza Strip at the weekend, a
minister announced Wednesday.
"Mr. Rabin took the decision after examining security questions linked
to this visit with the security services," Environment Minister Yossi
Sarid said.
Israel television reported that Arafat would arrive on Saturday and
stay for three days.
Arafat's senior adviser Nabil Shaath said the PLO chairman would travel
via the Rafah border crossing into the Strip "either on Friday evening
or Saturday morning".
Shaath said he would probably also visit the autonomous enclave of
Jericho on the West Bank, during a three or four day trip. But he made
no mention of Jerusalem, the capital Israel and the Palestinians both
claim.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said: "There was no reason to oppose a
visit to the Gaza Strip.
"On the other hand a visit to Jerusalem would require much more
complicated security preparations," he said. "Anyway Yasser Arafat has
not asked to come to Jerusalem this time."
Rabin had warned this three-day trip had to be coordinated with Israeli
security services.
Jewish settlers announced that they would hold non-stop demonstrations
against Arafat's return.
