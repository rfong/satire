US warns Europe to stay out of Israeli-Palestinian talks 
The United States warned Europe Tuesday not to meddle in negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians, saying it was unwise to try to
create a "mini-United Nations" in the Middle East.
Israel and the Palestinians have decided the United States would be
"the sole country" present at the talks that began earlier this month,
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
The talks attended by US envoy Dennis Ross were called to try to
implement a key provision of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords that
calls for a redeployment of the Israeli army from the West Bank town of
Hebron, which is predominantly populated by Arabs.
"You don't want to create a mini-United Nations in Taba and Eilat,"
Burns said, referring to the Egyptian and Israeli towns that have been
the site of negotiations.
"You want to have the two parties and the one indispensable country
that has been there for 25 to 30 years," he said.
The warning to Europe came as Britain announced that Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind will travel to the Middle East on November 3-6 and as
French President Jacques Chirac was making a high-profile visit to
Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher wrote a letter to French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette prior to Chirac's trip to give his
appreciation of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Burns said.
He declined to disclose the content of letter but went on to express
Washington's US view that the United States is the only country that
should be involved in the current round of Israeli-Palestinian talks.
A similar letter was sent to Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring as the
current chairman of the 15-member European Union, Burns said.
