Japan's NCP Leader to Step Down 
Japanese Land Minister Chikage Ogi will step down as leader of the New
Conservative Party (NCP), one of the two ruling coalition partners of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), NCP officials said Monday.
The decision was made during Monday's meeting of NCP lawmakers
following Ogi's hospitalization last week due to illness.
NCP Secretary General Takeshi Noda will become the new leader,
according to the officials.
Ogi had a fever last Thursday and was hospitalized the same day.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has said Ogi will retain her
ministerial post.
The matter of Ogi's replacement as party head has been on the lips of
party officials following NCP's loss in the House of Councillors
elections in July.
Ogi, an actress-turned politician, was the only NCP lawmaker to seize a
seat in the election although the party had three seats up for grabs.
Japan's three-party ruling coalition is formed by the LDP, the NCP and
the New Komeito party.
