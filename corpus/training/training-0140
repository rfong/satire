Beijing to Popularize Use of Iodized Salt 
The daily use of iodized salt by families has been encouraged in the
Chinese capital as part of a national campaign against iodine
deficiency disorders.
According to the Beijing Evening News, a local salt company will
provide sufficient iodized salt for residents' daily use and the local
health department will monitor the results.
Local departments will tighten controls on salt and on illegal salt
trading in the market.
At present, only 64 percent of the iodized salt is approved for sale
and it is compulsory only in areas where iodine deficiency disorders
frequently occur.
Iodine deficiency is a serious endemic disease which threatens the
health of people and affects the normal development of human
intelligence.
