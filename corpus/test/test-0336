Williams Sisters Quit Wimbledon Doubles 
Defending Wimbledon champions Venus and Serena Williams pulled out of
the women's doubles on Tuesday after Serena fell ill.
The fourth seeds were due to face Martina Navratilova and Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, seeded 16th, in the third round.
Serena left Centre Court midway through the third set of her singles
quarter-final against Jennifer Capriati to be sick. She lost 6-7, 7-5,
6-3.
