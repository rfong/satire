Poland Adopts New Environmental Protection Law 
The Polish National Assembly (parliament) has passed a new
environmental protection law, giving more power to local governments to
deal with environmental issues, according to the Polish Press Agency.
Under the new law, all the pollutant enterprises should strictly hold
the pollution level set by the provincial governors, who are authorized
to name the names of the violators.
The governors are also empowered to sound alarms when the smoke level
is high in the air and take measures to limit the number of cars on the
street, the report said.
However, experts note that although Poland has made great efforts to
improve its environment, it still has a long way to go. Now, as many as
11 percent of the country are seriously polluted, with about one third
of its population living in the polluted areas.
