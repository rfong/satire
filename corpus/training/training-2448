Sharp plans further expansion of LCD production 
Japan's Sharp Corp. plans to expand its production of liquid crystal
display (LCD) panels over the next few months to meet growing demand
for laptop computers with colour screens, an official said Wednesday.
The official said production lines for super twist nematic (SDN) panels
would be built at a new plant in western Japan scheduled to start
operating in July. The new lines will be ready as early as August.
But he dismissed as "speculation" a Nihon Keizai Shimbun report that
Sharp's production capacity for STN-LCD panels would subsequently rise
to 500,000 units a month, twice as much as the previous year's level.
STN-LCD panels are much cheaper to produce than thin-film transistor
devices known as TFT-LCD panels. But their resolution is inferior to
TFT-LCD panels, making them more suitable for computer rather than
television screens.
Sharp, the world's bigest producer of LCD panels, has so far spent 53
billion yen (602 million dollars) on building the new plant in Mie
prefecture but the total amount of the investment is not known, the
official said.
