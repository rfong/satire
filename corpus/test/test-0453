Time Warner Inc. and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said they were holding
merger talks in a potential deal that would create the world's biggest
media and entertainment group. Earlier media reports had said Time Warner
was offering some 8.5 billion dollars for TBS, which includes Cable News
Network. "Discussions concern an exchange of Time Warner stock for Turner
Broadcasting stock, following which Turner Broadcasting System would become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Time Warner Inc," the companies said in a
statement. "Significant issues remain to be negotiated and there can be no
assurance that agreement will be reached or a transaction consummated,"
they added.  PRETORIA: Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi announced his
government will implement a program of democratisation which will lead
eventually to the restoration of civilian rule in his country.  Addressing
the press after a meeting with his South African counterpart Alfred Nzo in
Pretoria, Ikimi said Nigerian military ruler Sani Abacha would announce
this new program, starting October 1, to introduce "firm civil democratic
rule" in Nigeria.
