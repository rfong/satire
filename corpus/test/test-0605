U.S. Deficit in Current Account Shoots Up to Record High 
The U.S. trade deficit in the current account jumped 20 percent in the
second quarter of this year to a record 56.5 billion U.S. dollars, the
Commerce Department reported Thursday.
The deficit rose from a record 46.7 billion dollars in the first
quarter. The growth puts the nation on track to reach a deficit over
200 billion dollars for all of 1998.
The development would be the worst since the government began tracking
the data just after World War II, and would beat the record of 168
billion dollars set in 1987. Last year's deficit was 155 billion
dollars.
With economic troubles hitting Asia starting last summer and, more
recently, Russia and Latin America, American companies are seeing their
export sales slump. At the same time, sharply devalued foreign
currencies have permitted foreign companies to sell cheaply in the
United States.
The deficit in goods alone hit a record 64.8 billion dollars in the
second quarter, up 16 percent from the first quarter, while the U.S.
surplus in services such as travel and consulting, rose only 1 percent
to 20.9 billion dollars.
The current account, a more broad way for measuring external trade also
include investment flows between the United States and other counties,
and foreign aid.
